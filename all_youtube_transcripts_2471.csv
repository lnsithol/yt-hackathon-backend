p7ZMLkEhSbM,Sarah Baartman Centre of Remembrance in Hankey remains incomplete - Joe McGluwa weighs in,2024-10-18T07:01:09Z,295,the Parliamentary oversight committee says that it is concerned over delays in the completion of the Sara Bartman Center of Remembrance in Hani in the Eastern Cape the center remains nowhere near completion and this despite 10 years of construction and up on top of that 10 years it has already spent 247 million Rand on the center since April of 2014 but construction at this point remains only 37% complete now the center of remembrance was built in honor of um documenting the life of Sara Bartman as well as the heritage of the koi and Sun people as well as color communities but to talk to us more about this matter we joined virtually by the chairperson of the portfolio committee on Sports arts and culture Mr Joe McLure uh thanks so much for your time this morning and welcome to morning live Mr ml good morning San good morning to all the listeners so more than 10 years after construction started on the SAR Bartman Center of remembrance and with more than 247 million already pumped into the facility we hear that it's only 37% complete let's first get your reaction to what has happened so far well uh Sakina what uh the SAR Bartman development is concern as I used to call it it for me is actually a Monumental disgrace it is a Monumental disaster it is very unfortunate that the people of hanky has been treated in this fashion now as the portfolio committee for sport arts and culture our main objective and and core business is to engage in oversight un towards the uh entities and also the department Sports arts and culture and we have also adopt a noons attitude doesn't matter who is involved and where it is but we are actually adopt a hashtag follow the money approach and we have decided we have a numerous problems in the department Sports arts and culture when it comes to these kind of contracts and developments it is not only M museums and libraries but it's also infr structure of this nature and in this particular case the portfolio committee sport arts and culture has decided to in its oversight role to go and see for themsel and ask the department what is actually transpiring here it is actually so sad when we arrive also at the premises to not that the uh that the project is uh under 50% in completion but we've also found that it it has now become a trend I mean since 2014 this project was supposed to be completed in 2016 but for me there is an outright you know negligence and a lack of oversight and monitoring uh from the Department Sports arts and culture who is sponsoring this project we also are concerned as the portfolio committee that there are too many entities involved and do actually you know leave a a a a gap for for corruption it leave a gap for fruitless expenditure and we must emphasize that we are not happy of what we have heard when we visit this premises and and I'm curious to know Mr ml what it is exactly that you heard because 10 years you mentioned the word oversight at least twice in that first response so where was the oversight why did it take 10 years to get to this point where we say it is unacceptable well so many uh entities here is responsible and must explain on what is transpired When we arrive at the premises we have been told so many reasons of one which Co has become a norm amongst the department uh uh uh managers as an excuse for not completion this project was supposed to be done in 2016 it has been extended from a 160 million Rand to a 240 million rent and the reasons that has been given was uh uh uh shy work other reasons such as they could not pay the contractors and you must note that it is the department Sports arts and culture it is the department uh of Public Works and infrastructure and then also the dbsa the Development Bank of South Africa who is a governmental institution and also blame is put uh to the dbsa who could not pay the contractors I mean if you uh to have a budget Sakina there is just no way that you can have this kind of overspend when it comes to this kind of of of budget we visited the place instead we believe that that uh uh Place could has could have been developed in stages it was a better butter experience to arrive at the tombstone uh of Sara Bartman which has been removed without the permission of the entire Community this is supposed to be a place of remembrance we have also made a claran call to both the minister DPW and even to the South African uh Heritage uh uh uh Resource Council we have made a clear clarent call to say please engage engage with the community of Hani because we have lost an opportunity here but it is a growing concern that contractors has been utilized from houting and that is the tendency what is happening within the department we have state-ofthe-art facilities facilities in what we called Manda the former Graham town which has been done by a local project management which has been done by a local architect but the rest of the development in Sarah Bartman has been from Outsiders no local people has been utilized instead it one of the reasons also mentioned was because of a strike of the people of Hani they should have done this it was their right to do this because no no local people has been utilized uh to to to to be involved in this particular contract it me they mention taxi strikes that there is also a road a entrance Entrance Road that was supposed to be done it was not done imagine s if if we could have complete this project the benefit that this project could have given to uh South African and also we say the local empowerment uh uh we could have Boost instead uh uh this project and and and as the committee we have recommend serious recommendations that one because what we are facing here is consequence management and I think we can only have and get this project right if we deal with the consequence management there's also a tendency of ministers currently that you know that is a a newly appointed by the president yes we respect that we take note of that but ministers must take full responsibility of that department because I used to say in the portfolio committees that you have have received this department foood stewards so deal with the issues here deal with it even if those individuals are not uh with us anymore we can deal with those individuals as a result we will then deal with the problems they are using sin 2 million Rand 2 million Rand for Consultants there's one of my favorite place during my oversight in in the Eastern Cape it's called Centon on sea it's a very small municipality they have not used any consultant they have shown this country that it can be done they have utilized local smm they have utilized the community they have you they have spent so much money and when we we were so satisfied but we cannot say the same of the Sara Bartman project that was supposed to be done long time ago DPS dpsa called meetings no one is turning up during our oversight I think what is worth and and and and and what is actually a of grave concern was that the that the DG did not even pitch for that particular meeting we also as a collective decided that listen you two ministers the department of of uh Sports arts and culture and the Department Public Works and infrastructure you must come together get your act in get uh in order and we say we want to hear how best are we going to address this this problem yeah and and and that's all good and well moving forward but this project the tender was awarded in 2014 Mr mlu and it was meant to be completed in 2016 the initial cost was so what was the reason for the project not being completed in 2016 who was responsible where was the oversight and what are you going to do now to hold people accountable well obviously some of the other reasons was the termination of contracts uh it was also the fact that uh appointments of Art and coordinators uh you know uh that were supposed to be on site right at their cost that has escalated and also a very a very interesting one Sakina is the fact that they gave a reason of some of the delays was because of of of of poor quality but we actually CAU the department out when we asked a question how do you deal with payments and they they themselves indicated that we are not paying anyone and unless unless we are we are only issuing a a a Payment Certificate uh uh unless someone was on the premises to do investigation so what happened is they they go and then they give a a a a Payment Certificate well they are happy with the work but only to find out this this year with the the the request for more money is that you have given a certificate of of of completion uh uh you were satisfied and now you have called out a consultant and that consultant has GI indication to say listen here was poor shorty work so how do you give a certificate how do you give a certificate of payment and also there is a trend and and and uh uh in in not only this department I have noticed through throughout the country there's a trend where contractors contractors uh uh engage with uh in this particular case with the Department of Public Works and then there's a delay in payment and there's a clause within the memorandum of understanding and we are appeal to them we want to see that clause and we want to make recommendations to see to what extent we can take that out because uh contractors are fully entitled if they are not getting paid and that is what really make us angry and your political claws just come out like that and then if if if the department pay late even if the department pay late in a particular case recently a contractor has been paid 3 million but a contractor has been paid late but there's a clause saying if you're not happy if you did not receive your money if you have been paid late you are entitled to withdraw from this whole contract even down goods and services on the premises but you are entitled to charge the department for that money so somehow somewhere there is a Syndicate somehow somewhere there is a mafia within the system and we as a collective must get rid of this yes the point is you spoke about consequence management earlier what will that look like you speak about the contractors the first contractor Liber Consulting um 30mon contract they were the ones who were initially appointed um they were given 168 million Rand from the start of April 2 14 until October 2016 and they failed to complete there were cost overruns of 21 million Rand why was that even allowed to happen given the amount of money Mr ml that was paid to Leber construction and moving ahead are you going to try and recover some of that money from Leber construction well uh one of the silly things that the the department recommend was that we should act we are not on that premises our business is oversight and rightfully so paying a contractor so much money without the work being done I again I I would say that it is an indictment and the main thing and the main reasons what these departments are doing sinina is to play with variations we have an indicator some of them are not smart at all we have targets and then you'll find when it comes to meeting those targets it does not it does not satisfy us but the only way for me I'm saying heading The Way Forward especially now when we are going to deal with the medium-term uh uh uh budget judgment it is important in the meantime that we have to get a clear picture from the minister we have to get a clear clear picture picture on what is transpired because I think we need a coherent reform approach to deal with officials the the officials actually they are the ones that we need to transform our country is busy to transform but I think our officials who find themselves with the hands in the purse of the public they are the ones we should deal with the entities the department Sports arts and culture has a responsibility they have a cause and that is to deal with wasteful expander uh so that South Africa's money could be spent much better when it comes to the poor when it comes to uh the economy when it comes to fundamental uh things there's a fundamental challenge that we have here and that is the officials that is not transformed the department and in this particular case is the sponsor the the implementing agent dpsa the the implementing agent dbsa those are the ones that should have been monitored but Shifting the monies around in this fashion just transfer the responsibility to someone else there is no interest no interest from the Department sport of arts and culture to keep this entities responsible later as well with some of these entities when you read the report it does not speak to what is happening on the ground down there some of these reports s if you read it it read like you read a horror move I think we need a approach where we give consequence management among Senor of of of officials and we're going to wait to see Mr ml unfortunately out of time but we're going to wait to see exactly how that is tackled uh because oversight has clearly failed on this particular project and we're going to wait to see whether anyone is held accountable but thank you so much for your time Mr Joe MCL chairperson of the portfolio Committee of sports arts and culture speaking to us about the state of the Sara Bartman Center of Remembrance in hanky in the Eastern Cape just incidentally the second contractor there was paid 219 million in uh 2020 for
49oA2AwYPs4,Sporting weekend preview with Khanyiso Tshwaku,2024-10-18T05:53:15Z,202,it's another weekend full of sporting Action Now Formula 1 is back in the United States there is a United rugby Championship the women's T20 World Cup final is at the business end and the calling knockout um has plenty of mouthwatering action for football lovers as it kicks off today now to help us dissect uh this and what we can look forward to this weekend in terms of your sporting action we are joined by sabc sport analyst and commentator kis Tru K say good morning to you thank you so much for joining us on Sports on morning live good morning V and good morning to the viewers Kus I want us to start and speak about the calling knockout because the action starts today and we know that amazulu will be hosting Sten Bosch FC and you look at the two teams having starts that have been very different amazulu rooted right at the bottom of the bway Premiership and when we look at stellen BOS FC they've G they've had a good cup run I mean they won the calling knockout last year they are the defending Champions and they also made a all the way to the final of the mtn8 speak to me about your permutations and expectations on tonight's Clash look it's not going to be easy mulu with the new coaching du and will probably want to start this tournament probably the highest note possible and that's actually trying to advance um in a cup competition one need to remember this probably the one trophy that am would have actually won you date back to 1992 um when this competition had a different sponsor name than the Coca-Cola cup actually won um this tournament so you look like it's actually 32 years um since they've actually won this particular tournament but I think um the passage of time um has taken care of that I think if you look at the current selling B group at the moment they playing some really good football yes had a slightly Rocky start to the BET Premiership season but I think they sorted that one out and as defending Champions probably this is one trophy that they would clearly like to defend they've already show the ability um to play cup competition football I mean the fact that they eliminated M Sundowns um in the mtn8 and they showed how well they played there and how unlucky they were in the mtn8 final I think they are probably in for much better for much better trip to Durban as compared to the final I mean they already know how to win in Durban having won um last year's calling knockout cup there in Duran um so I think for them it may a bit of a a bit of a seminal return but I would be surprised if they advance to the next round but then again cup competition cup cup Cup competition football um is a rather different Beast it's a different Beast let's speak about Saturday's clash between ker Chiefs as well as super sports United we've seen a different ker Chiefs under coach nezrin Nai we've seen better structure from them and then you look at their opponents on the day Super Sports United coach Gavin hunt having had some injuries you have a Bradley that is injured and we know what he can do in front of goals how's that one looking for you look is going to be a tricky one super sport for some reason and G hand have just not clicked in Cup competitions either being first or second rout exits um probably when you look at all the Cup competitions um when you look at this is probably the one of the harder ones to win because they have to play um Premiership sides all the way to win so from this round of 16 so it it it may look like a four game stretch but it being a four game Str is a tricky one because let's say now you're a super sport um you beat the K Chiefs it's not like you're going to meet the first division second division side along the way you still need to meet one of the league sites in order to actually get to the final so I think for for for Super Sport I mean it's going to be a tricky game I think for for Chiefs in particular they have a lot riding on this game because remember that they didn't they finished outside the top eight so they immediately ruled the M of mtn8 so unlike other teams would probably would have started the season with four trophies to play for they've already got three the last thing they would want now is for early elimination in this tournament leaving them with only the league and the net Bank cup um to chase so I think well Super Sport will be under pressure um to actually do well in the toour but I think for Chiefs in particular with the kind of expectation um that the started the season with with how they've played with with the style of football they've played on so far I think there's more pressure on Chiefs in particular um to actually play well just a quick one kanes as we wrap up the discussion on the calling knockout we look at uh TS Galaxy chaper United as well as rich as B and kukun any surprises You're Expecting in those two clashes probably those are the games that you you know the thing with Cup competitions is that because they needs to be a winner you may find that those games May do out some really exciting football I mean if you look at a cha United side they started this season pretty well TS Galaxy will find this on the other hand have the best of starts um to the season so you may find that those particular games are probably the one that when you look at the the the Orlando Pirates are hosting my gu Sundowns are hosting golden AR you probably think that those are games that would get top bilding but you find with cup with with Cup football in particular these are the games you can't take for granted because also these are the teams that are gener not in the league riding but also look at comp like these as hey this is a tournament that you can win and especially the fact that they don't have um first or second division um speed HS um to negotiate because these are teams that they play on a week week in week out basis and these are the time they can probably look at them and say these are the teams that we can probably beat on any given day so I think with the way that this tournament is set up I would be surprised if those games one be exciting two actually do have some really really strange results uh we're certainly looking forward to that let's move our conversation now and start speaking record with the IC T20 World Cup final coming through on Sunday and the pro TI is making it to the final we look at the second semifinal taking place today at 4 p.m. West Indies up against New Zealand who do we actually want to win this game so that we play that team on the final and why look you one could say maybe New Zealand considering that you know what you get from New Zealand um we've seen how consistent they've been in the buildup to the tournament and playing in the tournament and you also realize that you don't want to play the West Indies um considering that the West Indies when they turned it up they pretty much the sto B we saw how they took um England the part I mean they bowled magnificently at the top then um a that chase with I mean in a similar way that South Africa did against Australia yesterday I think also though when you're in the final you don't M it do I think it just doesn't matter who you play South Africa did the business side beating the strongest team I mean the tournament and did so with a very cold deficiency that is um something that you never see from South Africa I think the biggest surprise probably of this year from a cricket perspective is that we've had two South African teams in finals in20 in the 220 finals I mean look at how well the men's team played just to get to the final what were difficult conditions in the West Indies and then when you look at how South Afric the South African womens team built up in T20 cricket I'm not looking very convincing through building up the tournament but just played the right Cricket when it truly mattered I think the England the Lost against England was probably a blessing in disguise now because it just allowed them to find a way of playing their 220 cricket and it probably mattered yesterday where and K in particular deliver truly mattered yes there were asterisk with especially with how slowly she's bed at number three but when it truly mattered um she rocked up so look you look at that game now you look at you realize that um having beaten Australia one feels that hope one hopes that the South African team still have one very good game left because you know don't want that feeling where maybe that was their final because they're in the final now um and be sure South Africa have shown that they have an ability um to win semi-finals and the lost to Australia would was very strong side in the 2022 final but I think they'll look at this particular final Sunday and realize that you know what this is the final we can win regardless of who they play well Kisa thank you so much for your time this morning it's always a pleasure chatting to you thank you all right that is of course Sac sport commentator and analyst just unpacking what we can look forward to in terms of the sport this weekend and of course we're still going to touch on the URC because we know there is that rugby action as well

WN_SWZXwhE8,Mental Health | Grappling with toxic workplace culture,2024-10-17T21:00:55Z,259,right let's expand on the conversation roping in clinical psychologist and founder of cohesive collaboration Sanda kala who joins us for more very good evening to you thank you so much for your time I mean just listening in to just only one individual talking about their experience when it comes to the workplace which has now become a dreadful Place uh for her she spoke a bit about waking up to go to a job she loved is now very very stressful what are the factors that develop and sustain a toxic workplace culture good evening good evening to the viewers yeah I think the main thing to focus on here is the sentiment of it's a multivariate issue there's multiple reasons as to what propagates this and like you rightfully pointed out we must think about all the particular factors I would say often it comes from a place of ignorance and that ignorance is rooted a little bit more in the just a lack of awareness in what are the particular triggers of mental health difficulties what are some of the Dynamics that exacerbate existing mental health conditions or can even trigger new mental health conditions and and I must say that that ignorance sometimes is coming from an innocent place and that's why we need more mental health awareness campaigns especially with this being Mental Health Awareness Month um I think speaking about it like this really helps quite a bit in reducing the amount of of ignorance from that perspective but but then I think certain times there's also a certain level of complacency in which individuals don't necessarily even want to seek out insight and knowledge into all the mental health difficulties that employees may experience uh and that allows for a bit of like plausible deniability on some level but I think if we want to increase accountability in the space we need to realize that if you are an employer if you have a senior role or supervisory role it should be your responsibility to educate yourself on some of these Dynamics and then to think how can I play a role in bringing the best well-being for my employees so that I can not only get the best output from my employees but that I can also create an overall holistic good workplace environment so so I think it's that and and then on the far extreme side we must also acknowledge that people in the workplace are also still people at the end of the day and human beings are imperfect and human beings are flawed and sometimes people are susceptible to competition they're susceptible to Mal there's so many different factors that may play out that even in personal relationships play out it's the same in the workplace so I I think it's a myriad of issues starting with things that are a bit more innocent and benign with things that are a bit more malicious but I think the full spectrum of it is such that we need to do something about it you speak about um you know the the role of of leaders in a workplace I mean hierarchy in itself can the toxic culture stem from pressures to perform I mean not using it as an excuse but just looking at some of the uh contributing factors exactly you know that even individuals that are maybe in a more senior position they still reporting to someone they still have to meet certain deliverables and outputs and the you know sometimes we we villainize the the superiors or the people in in higher positions but I think we also forget that they are accountable and beholden to certain structur as well so if if we just humanize them on some level it it starts creating a bit of empathy in both directions and I think if we get caught up in one is the perpetrator one is the victim people then tend to just defend themselves if they feel like they're being accused of being a perpetrator of a toxic environment and people that feel like they're being victimized by someone from that position feel a deeper sense of helplessness and hopelessness so it then just creates this vicious cycle where it's exacerbating it in both directions so I think it's important to humanize in all regards and to say okay fine now that we've done that what is each person's responsibility what is each person's role and can they play their part what impact does it have on an individual who finds themselves in such an environment I mean one the one uh lady who was speaking to some of of my colleagues spoke about how she realized that she needed help when she couldn't perform as well as she used to perform and that in itself was a red flag for her M yeah it's quite common you know the same disorders that one may experience in their personal life one can also experience in the workplace setting and sometimes even more severe forms of it so you look at the Myriad of of depressive symptoms that a person can experience anxiety symptoms all of these conditions come with some drop in functionality and they also affect one's routine and structure so you may find there may be difficulties with sleep with appetite with memory attention concentration and the more that these difficulties intensify the more the person feels anxious about their job security and the more anxious you feel about your job security the more it starts exacerbating that anxiety in general so it then just starts to spiral so quickly hence why it's so important to catch these things quite early on I think workplace settings have done quite well with employees Wellness days when it comes to physical health checkups but I think the mental health checkup portion of it has been lacking often the mental health spaces are somewhat superficial in nature it feels more compliance-based and it's like you entitled to maybe one two three or four consultations but it's almost like get on with it get your consultations keep it moving rather than creating comprehensive holistic you know systems that catch individuals not only from a reactive perspective but also preventatively that if we talk about preventative mental health uh initiatives I think we can go a very long way in the workplace setting as well and very quickly options when it comes to help where do people go yeah often the best support systems are the ones that you trust so I would say even if it's work like something work rated start off with your personal relationships that are most nourishing most valuable most trusting speak to someone confide in them just so that you feel like you're not alone in it that you have someone beside you to go through it with you and then it also helps to speak with fellow employees that you feel quite safe around that you've built a reliable trustworthy relationship so again you can see if some of you are experiencing shared difficulties and then go through the appropriate escalation channels in South Africa we have great labor laws but how we utilize that and Implement is a different story so I think for individuals to use HR channels if they feel safe to do so for individuals to explore some of their workplace Employee Assistance programs employee Wellness programs I know there's always a hesitancy from a trust perspective what will get back to the employer but I think that should be something that's declared from the outright that everything I say in here is confidential and us as practitioners as psychological practitioners we're bound to the standards of the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the confidentiality parameters of that so if that is done in an appropriate manner I think that can create a trustworthy Rel relationship very well thank you so much for speaking to us this evening we're going to have to leave it there with clinical psychologist and founder of cohesive collaborations Sanda Cola of course expanding on the very important topic of mental health in the workplace
azLqaMI3HBQ,Pastor Ray McCauley remembered,2024-10-17T20:56:42Z,597,now Rama Bible Church founder Rama kley is being commemorated at a memorial service in randur north of Johannesburg this evening the 75y old Pastor died at his home surrounded by his loved ones on Tuesday last week McCoy founded Rama Bible Church in South Africa in 1979 we cross live now to senior reporter csala Lewis who joins us from there csala very good evening to you a lot of familiar faces taking to the podium this evening sharing their memories of a man who was truly inspirational I mean we heard the like of anti-art activist Tokyo Sali speaking about the memorable Big Steaks that he ate in mol's house all right and Pa so much has been said about the legacy of the late Pastor Ray McAuley today so many p tribute to him at the very Pulpit where for so many years he inspired a great nation not just of course here in South Africa but internationally as well we've seen quite a number of pastors both from South Africa and across or abroad basically speaking about the indelible Mark that he made towards South Africa and how he went on to inspire them as well one of the speakers of course you'd know ANC veteran Tokyo sale basically saying that you know Pastor Ray mcau was someone who basically push them towards the poor at the center of everything that he did the people were never to be forgotten always ask questions about what was to be done for the most destitute what was to be done for the poorest of the of the poor so many you would have heard over the past couple of days talking about uh the legacy of this great man behind the pulpit but also what he had done for those uh you know who were downtrodden those who were poor those who simp had no hope left in them he was that source of Hope for many but uh as others would have said on the podium he didn't draw the congregation towards himself but he drew the congregation to God one of the people that will speak greatly about Pastor Ray McCauley and the contribution that he made towards a smooth and peaceful transition to democracy in this country is Reverend Frank Chan and he joins me live now rev thank you so much for joining us I appreciate you giving us your time there much to be said about Pastor L McCauley in particular uh behind the pulpit but also what he did for South Africa we also heard in D Tokyo talk about the support that was given to uh prisoners at the time for them not to lose hope that they would return to a country and change around its fortunes yeah well you know my experience about Pastor Ray M was during the most difficult times in this country in the mid 80s late 80s that's when I met him and when I met him he was looking for answers because preaching the gospel in a conflict situation where there was war where there was conflict just didn't make sense and he wanted to understand the challenges we were facing and he made an arrangement to come and meet me I was the General Secretary of the Council of churches at that time and we sat together remember it's charismatic Evangelical I mean Pentecostal I come from that tradition and he wanted to talk to me and I'm General secret of the Council of churches We Are In the Heat of the struggle the war and and he was very humble open and listened and many people say that meeting we had changed him so greatly and he became part of the solution in the society became part of the engagement with the leadership in the society and we don't have time to talk about all of those things but we had to fly to at the sis Skai together when there was a crisis in the sis Skai people were killed there was conflict and we went together there to go and talk to too who was the leader of that b to stand at that time and and that tells you how much transformation Pastor Ray went through from that conversation we had to the type of role that he played in the nation and rev uh just uh before we wrap up that came at Great cost and we heard about that uh this uh evening where he was vilified for the stance that he took uh touted as a sellout yeah because he at the time he spoke the truth about what was taking place and in actual fact I think it was at the Truth and Reconciliation where he he he he he warned or or or called out white South Africans to say you're actually being misled by the aparted government yeah I mean he couldn't take that it was like a Damascus experience he couldn't change the way he changed began to talk about Justice began to talk about reconciliation began to talk Against Racism I mean the white members of his church of course wouldn't understand that the white population in the country couldn't understand that but he took a St St stance and he really withered the storms he really um made sure that what he believed God was saying to him actually can be done and should be done and he continue to do so I mean I experienced the same thing in fact I got suspended from my church for a long time uh 9 years to be more precise uh so as we wait that struggle there were people who did not understand why it had to be done today of course they value that history they now know the truth even the leaders in my church say so and we thank God that uh God has carried us through but there was a price to be PR paid Reverend Frank shakane thank you very much and we do appreciate you waiting for us we had a bit of a delay thank you very much indeed we do appreciate God bless you too thank you very much indeed Reverend uh Frank chane and certainly um you know he uh had been there with the late Pastor Ray McCauley at a very critical time in South Africa you know uh Pastor Ray mcau being vilified uh during that time for calling out white South Africans and uh the apartate government at the time for the atrocities against black people in South Africa you can only but imagine during that time and as we've heard over the past couple of days he certainly did not sit on the sidelines he didn't only preach from the pulpit but beyond the pulpit a number of politicians as we've heard uh you know uh would be uh wrapped around the knuckles if I can if he believe that certain things were not going well in the country he certainly did speak truth to power and at the center of that was the church but he did believe that the church had a greater role to play outside of the pulpit as well in fostering political and social change all right I'm going to cross now to my colleague baletto is going to speak to some of the congregants who were greatly inspired by the late Pastor Ray McCauley good night for me well um thank you so much CH we are coming to you live just outside um um Buble church here in L Johannesburg where by service of Ray moli has just been wrapped up as you know that um Ray died last week on Tuesday at the age of 75 while at his home surrounded by his families but with me right now I have Aang who is the member of this church the RMA Bible Church well Aang thank you so much for your time um maybe if you can tell us how do you think Pastor Ray would like to be remembered as I think Pastor Ray was a man who spoke about grece I think that his mission was was purely about the salvation of Jesus Christ um he lived for that he is all about saving lives and I think that his most important thing is to be remembered about a man who worked to actually help to fulfill the gospel of God and actually ensure that people are saved and come to know Jesus and have a relationship with him now how are you going to remember Pastor Ray Pastor Ray had a big influence in my life I mean I came to the church when I was 20 years ago um and it was the first time I actually listened to a pastor speak about Grace I will never forget how he spoke about the grace of God and how there is no condemnation and the the importance of Salvation that for me is something that one can take through in life and outpour it to other people and I think that outpouring it to others and teaching people the same concept of the gospel is something that I'd always be grateful for and remember Pastor well umang I understand that there was a church service here on Sunday um maybe tell us um how was the mood or the feel of the church service which was the first church service um since the passing of Pastor R okay so it was very somber um I think it was a moment of reality for us as a church um it was very difficult but I think in the same stride because of how well Pastor Ray has done I think everybody can attest to the fact that he ran his race um and he lived up to the faith um it was also reassuring that he also was putting Pastor Joshua in this position in time um there was a comfort in that to know that he will take the baon and run with it but it was a very difficult service um and there will always be a remembrance of Pastor R I think this whole church is about him um but we also understand and are looking forward to Pastor Joshua um and running with the church and leading us forward to the bigger things that are to come Tang thank you so much for your time well that was tabang who has been a member of this church for more than 20 years and speaking to some of the congregant who are here they told me that they will remember or or rather they have described Ray M as someone who brought unity in South Africa and in in in in the world at LGE um by using his Evangelical work um we know that um Pastor Ray will be um laid to rest on Saturday but for now it's back to you in studio well thank you very much chal Le giving us a sense of what has come out of the memorial service at the Rama Bible Church of founder r McAuley tributes and uh legacies being discussed there
SNuZ1_IeT1w,Democracy 30 | Addressing unfinished business of TRC,2024-10-17T20:50:36Z,146,"the South African Coalition for Trans transitional Justice hosted the national reparations conference in Johannesburg over the past two days discussing reparations for apartate era human rights violations now the conference aims to address the unfinished business of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hoping to find a path to Justice and healing for South Africa and our chairperson of South African coalision for transitional Justice Shirley gun joins us now Shirley a very good evening to you thank you so much for your time this is a conference which brought survivors of a parted conflict together from across the country hoping for for some closure and finding a path to Justice I would imagine that issues of accountability would have been Central yes um well let me just firstly uh clarify under the executive director of the uh South African Coalition for transitional Justice not the chair person I used to be the chairperson and it was it was a um a very historic moment RAR because this has been a very long painful struggle to uh arrive at this juncture where we have the a range of Civil Society stakeholders and representatives of various communities present and the Department of Justice so it was it was historic because there's been great delays and pain additional pain on people's lives that there's been such a slow progress and I think also the limitation of the way in which the ACT is interpreted is um um confining the victim Community to those who were identified by the TRC and um we we've we we're in discussion now about how there can be further registrations for people who are left out yeah so yes accountability is the critical question here so as you look back to when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission closed its doors the impact of some of the thorny issues which have now resulted in intergenerational trauma um you know cries of very little support what have the families had to say well we we um I think there's desperation uh across the country um lack of recognition lack of services lack of um the the the the services that should have also been um implemented post the TRC like housing and education and healthare and psychosocial services so all with with without any of that the trauma is passed on to the next Generation so it wasn't really multi families as such that we were uh in and in it it were individuals that were elected through provincial work um meetings and who were then representing their provinces at this at this particular National Conference that was held over two days um and concluded today and I'm I'm I'm very happy to to to say that it was a good outcome um eventually a very painful story actually to Bear witness to again and um um but I think the Department of Justice is showing a great willingness to partner with civil society and victim organizations to to to to Really resolve the problems of a very slow and incomplete process maybe let's I mean you talk about a good outcome and of course the problems here are what have have brought you to this point where you are actually in discussion with the Department of Justice what have been the biggest loopholes since the commission handed over the recommendations to government I mean many families I've heard over the years feeling left out of that entire process well there this the time frame of the human rights violations committee um was very short in fact only 18 months and in that period um not everyone was ready to speak and to come forward with their statements not everyone had all the documentation that they needed to hand over to the TRC for their case to be considered and for their to be a a finding that they were in fact victims of gross human rights violations um and and and so for various reasons um there were scores of people who didn't come forward during the the life of the TRC and um in 2003 the TRC with in the final uh volume um had recommended that the the pr the the process is continuous that it's not confined to what is now known as the closed list of 22 and a half thousand people and um of those not everyone could be traced because there was a long delay a long delay of 5 Years From the time of handing over the TRC report to anas Mandela by the by the TRC um to the time when eventually reparations were were paid out and it was substantially less than what was recommended I'm talking here in terms of the monetary individual payment was substantially less than what the TOC had recommended so you know I think if you delay something by five years you're going to find difficulty in tracing everybody and then there were a few that or some that that didn't feel that they needed they needed that money they had enough and they didn't need the reparations which was 30,000 um but for those who did receive 30,000 it didn't settle the scores that they had in the um the hospit hospital s and the operations that they needed or prosthesis or or many many of the um uh to in in order to redress the harm that had been caused I know they questions disappointment actually that was implemented in I know there's also been questions around the president's fund I mean questions and of course um some potential action that has been sought there as you try and follow the the paper trail every single year and um the department would claim that it's been a clean audit every single year but there are some red flags that we uh have picked up in our own research um and that is the way in which the uh president's fund is invested the pic in quite risky types of investment and um there's not a transparency around that um we have absolute confidence that that money is not used for anything else other than for the beneficiaries um that it was um raised for in initially but um we're not really we're not at all happy about um um how it is um invested and and and the details around that yeah we would like that information um so um and also you know um the the the big thing is that um there's legislation now being drafted or regulations rather being drafted around housing and educ and not education housing and um other benefits um Health but um there still must be a consultative process um and this is this is a long time after the closure of the TRC that people are now finally being um awarded the type of support that they've needed for so long um and so many people have already died Ian we can't delay a day longer than what has happened so far thank you so much for you know the department of D okay okay finish the part about the Department of Justice yes thank you the Department of Justice will also bring together the other Ministries that are responsible for reparations okay and um so that it can be there can be a more holistic approach and inclusive approach to reparations yeah absolutely thank you so much for speaking to us this evening that was the executive director of the South African Coalition for transal justice Shirley G there expanding on some of the um some of the ways forward as uh people seek Justice"

the different parties committed themselves to um and at the same time I think one should say also keep in mind that the coalition government or the grand Coalition or the government of national Unity depending how you look at it at this stage represent 70% of all the members of parliament of the National Assembly so in order to say that it is not representative of the majority of South Africans um then denies this whole process of the election and the choices that the public have made the the uh voters have made in this respect um so I think this is where we the The Point of Departure where we start in terms of looking at this um it is of course the over time it's going to be there's going to be a second opportunity actually in two years time for the voters to give us a sort of feedback of what they regard as the uh accomplishments or not of the government of national at the time of the local government elections and what we have seen especially in in this election though it was a national and a provincial election that many of the issues that were in the Forefront in the election campaigns were actually local issues about Service delivery about Local Economic Development and other matters so I think this is will be for us an opportunity to to to assess where we stand with with the the government that was elected now m the other complaint really came about uh around how the MK part is unimpressed with the gnu which says uh in effect it's a coalition led by the da the par is making reference to to laws like the nhi bill the Bella Bill uh the the amended employment Equity Act passed by the sixth Administration arguing that they are in abeyance purely because the 20% DA has now found a 40% andc uh partner to now reverse and undermine transformation I mean that in itself speaks volumes when we talk about the the transformation part yes I think we should be careful not to overestimate the the influence of the da um in this government um they are very important and the political reality is that neither thec or the da can really act on their own they need each other they need the the combination of the two in order to reach the point Beyond 50% plus one thec doesn't have that with the 40% the da doesn't have it with the 20% so this is the logic of of a coalition government is that if neither party or no party has a majority then they have to work together and that is what we see all over the world where these Coalition governments are uh coalision governments have to find a middle ground in order to be able to work together and then other countries we see that they take months sometimes in order to negotiate that middle crme um in our case our constitution does not allow that to happen it must be done all round about 14 days or a little bit more um so that process is at the moment actually unfolding I'm glad you you you touched Professor pardon me on on our constitution because that of course also came up where we heard the MK party saying that it would be scrapped in favor of parli sovereignity at the core of course when we think about that would be the ultimate Authority for for law making where that would lie what are your thoughts around that I mean would such an idea even be feasible here in South Africa well we many countries do have a parliamentary system uh it's especially ironically actually the West system is the best example of that of the UK Canada and Australia and others so that's the countries with a more of a colonial background um so what we at the same time What for them to be able to implement this it means that they must get rid of the current Constitution and it is going to be a tough task because the supremacy of the Constitution is guaranteed in Section 1 C of the Constitution and section one provides the foundational values of the Constitution and it is ESP special as a result of that it's a special section and it requires a 75% not a 23 67 but a 75% majority yeah in order to change that so it means MK needs 75% of the total number of members of parliament in order to implement what they are saying they want to do the other ideals which were passed through were over plans for land expropriation without comp compensation a discussion uh Professor Kota which has been been viewed by some as one that may have perhaps been weaponized uh to scare South Africans away from each other as opposed to to uniting South Africans what are your thoughts on you know what has failed and and and just looking at that topic and the possibilities around it I mean when MK speaks about it what are you thinking well this is obviously something which is not new it comes it goes back to the time of the NC Youth League of the 2010s uh under the leadership of of julus malma they broke away and formed the eff to a large extent because of that it went to Parliament for the amendment of section 25 thec and the eff couldn't find them uh to uh a common position on this so it is it's not on the table anymore so but there is obviously from the left this is one of the key issues that that's been proposed together with a number of matters like the so-called nationalization of The Reserve Bank and others but this is regarded as one of the key components of uh of an economic or socioeconomic agenda that's been pushed by uh the parties left of thec um to what extent that will become an an a possibility of solving the problems while the majority of South Africans are actually urbanizing at the moment and what that's uh expropriation of land will amount to will it be about agricultural land or will it be land for for residential purposes to live on it I think so there's there's many more aspects that might be developed uh by these parties who propos this to say what exactly is going to be the correlation between the use of land and economic development in general given the the the tendencies that we are seeing that's happening in South Africa but many other parts of the world also land of course has a very strong identity Association a very strong Cultural Association a strong association with traditions and I think that is something which is understated very often it's more proposed in terms of the developmental value of land and I think these are aspects that must come back in the debate about land in general yeah absolutely thank you so much for speaking to us this even wrapping up that discussion with political analyst Professor Durk CER

African pastors to come and share their tributes today can you give a hand thank you thank you good evening everybody good Jos in front of that photog there of course Very and start toake your to Zelda and the MC family from the RMA family of churches executive uh which includes Pastor Josh by the way but uh Pastor ol and zoor Pastor Tony Castle Dr tis migua Pastor Larry Elliot and every member of the family of churches we extend our sympathies and prayers in this difficult time our hearts are with you and we know that you are already finding comfort in the memories that you you have shared with Pastor Ray and I know it will continue to guide you and uplift you know that you are in our prayers continuously and we pray that God's strength will be with you his peace will be with you in the days ahead and as I've said before you know although we're deeply saddened by Pastor Ray's passing but we we know that he lives on his legacy lives on his profound wisdom lives on his unwavering Faith his love for others his leadership his compassion his fight it lives on through every single one of us and therefore know today that within our hearts you know I was asked the question um so what now you know you're going to transision and then I think of the wisdom of Pastor Ray who had transitioned already a couple years ago and in his wisdom in the various organizations that he had uh LED um already positioning the right people so that we can continue the work that is going forth and um with the Rama family of churches you know we've been working beside Pastor Ray for the last two years already doing the work and um of course with uh the ifcc that came to see Pastor Ray we've got pastor at bosov on the executive with Bishop mosa Sono that will be speaking on on on Saturday and Pastor Don Phillips as well and um and we've got the Secretary General uh with us is pastor G Kaa and um just already there start in there taking the responsibility a couple years ago already and then Pastor Josh and Pastor uh Tera um already what God has done in and through you in these last two years has been amazing how God has used you how strong that you how strong you have stood and of course it's been tough it was up and down but and you know but it's amazing to see how between you and your father how you guys navigated the difficult times and you were able to conquer things and and and also as a family and standing together with with Zelda and and the W family we we take our hats off to you and we honor you for that we really do we really do and of course I can tell stories but they're not my stories to tell you know that are those are your stories to tell but um it's amazing to see that we can say Look What the Lord Has Done amen Look What the Lord Has Done so therefore we know Pastor Ray's Legacy will continue and that's why I'm excited to invite um of his sons to come speak of the most significant Ministries in the country and um we're going to Welcome to the stage Pastor ad bosov who will immediately be followed by pastor Pastor Don Phillips thank you very much I greet you in The Wonderful Name of Jesus you know I stand you with a heavy heart I know we call it a celebration but we have lost our father our pastor our friend and I think sometimes we just have to push the pause button and we need to reflect and we need to mourn when when when I received the news of Pastor Ray departing I spoke to him two days before and he sounded good he sounded fine it was like a gunshot hit me it was like something was taken out of me and I felt naked my father is gone my spiritual covering is gone so yes we can talk about the future but we can talk about that tomorrow today we have to talk about this man that paid a price that nobody will ever understand this man that no matter what he faced it's easy to come today and to stand on his shoulders as we all do but when he started in this country he was scrutinized criticized ridiculed every week but he stayed true the very white people that he tried to liberate from racism called him a betrayer but he stayed true to the cause and I want to celebrate that tonight and honor that tonight the man the man who' never changed the man who even when his body was broken he would stand on the pulpit bend over and he would tell you how much Jesus loves you he would show you how much Jesus loves you so can we love him back can we honor him back can we miss him for a moment I think one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life is when my Earthly father passed away on the Saturday I did not even know he passed away those days were no cell phones or technology and uh I passed at a non-racial church in lady brand and um 1988 so the government never opened my eyes I saw the truth through this man of God that I honor that I miss I I that I long for that I mourn for he opened my eyes that there is a better way and there is only one gospel and that is a gospel of reconciliation in those early years and I I I will address the family in a moment my dad was busy dying but I was so committed Let the dead Perry the dead and you go preach the gospel I think sometimes as Christians we lose the plot when when when you lose somebody that you care about you lost it's a sense of loss you just want to cry you want to weep and yes his legacy stands by itself and the future of Rama will be bright and I went that Sunday Saturday drove from that hospital and I preached the gospel the next morning and came back to visit my dad but he had gone he graduated while I was preaching the gospel because I thought that was the right thing to do and I think in the church we just want to get on with it how if if the vacuum is so big if the space is so large yes people have been raised up to take certain places but a vacuum that has been left by this man that can never be filled by anybody else a man that paid the price a man had suffered a man that was scorned yet he stood in this Pulpit every week and he preached Jesus Christ no matter what he went through and I'll tell you this tonight I didn't only know him as a man of God I did not only know him as a pastor I did not know him from the Pew I knew him as a friend I wrote a holly Davidsons with him I went on holiday with him his kids were this small for the last 35 years I've been part of that family I've walked this whole journey with him now I want to tell you that the pain is real for Zelda sitting here tonight and I want to say to you Zelda you were the love of his life we had in in in the stormy times we spoke um um but I want to tell you that he loved you and he treasured you and he loves you and I want to say to you Joshua I your dad and I spoke a lot about you people don't know this and I always said to your dad Joshua is the only one that can take over Rama but Joshua has to go and learn and you did you pioneered a church and you were successful and therefore it was inevitable for the Baton to be handed to you and I know that you will be faithful to your dad's memory Ministry that it's all about the lost you are every bit that he was and I mean your dad was so proud of you played the hockey he would brag about you play tennis he would brag about you that's the reality that is the man I know that people don't know they don't understand how can you not miss when your father goes how can you not miss when your pastor is no longer there are we Commodities that are so replaceable so easy when my brother died it was the worst day in my life I was distraught for months no for years actually it took me years to work to the fact that I lost my best friend my brother died a year apart from me so Alan I feel for you and the other brothers that are yeah if you are I feel for you I feel your pain it's real it's not just the shandai Hundai time my boat like Pastor Ray said and let's get on with it let's just if we talk about honor then be honorable in our morning and honor this time that we are experiencing loss we cannot talk about replacement before we have mourned the loss that we have experienced I won't speak long I want to close on his birthday my last text to him we had a CO conversation afterward said good morning Pastor Ray happy happy birthday I love and respect you so much thank you for being my mentor and for teaching me all that I know to day and for being the greatest pastor and leader that this country has ever seen you paved the way and you made it easy for us all I treasure you more than you'll ever know and I honor you I hope you get spoiled and I hope you get blessed as you deserve seeing Pastor Ray the last few years suffering like this broke my heart seeing him alone most of the time broke my heart seeing him no longer yeah has broken by heart I know God will fix it I know God will fix it but I want to tell you we have lost what cannot be replaced I can tell you many stories from 35 years ago good memories positive memories but let's not just brush over this I plead with you let it's mourn Bible says there's a time to mourn and and and the future will go on the seed is in Joshua it's in all of you as ifcc as a pastor that has stood on this platform many many times I mourn with you I hurt with you I weep with you I we I'm not a crier man I don't I don't weep but this last week I wept a lot thinking about him and I know he's in heaven and don't even give me that cuz I'm not in heaven I'm still down here and I have to deal with the loss and I have to work through it and I have to go on in the memories of what he left and the love that I felt the courage that I saw and that's made me stronger I hope you spoiled him while he was alive I hope you honored him while he was alive because it's easy to say words after somebody is dead but it's while that person is alive that we love we treasure we should have put him in Cotton wool when he was suffering treasure the ones God gives us he was the last leader of ifcc the founding fathers of ifcc that graduated into the presence of Jesus and please I am a pastor I know where he is to be absent from body the bodies to be present with the Lord I know all I've done a million funerals so you don't have to try and preach to me but I can tell you we have lost it's Heaven's gain but it's our loss and I weep with you I feel with you I pray that God comforts you as God is comforting me that God will strengthen you and that every time you walk in here you will remember the man of God that paved the way for Revival and for change in South Africa God bless you and may God keep you love to each one of you a big hug if Pastor a was here he would walk to you and he would give you a big big big Lebanese hug as only who could a big hug to each one of you God bless you it is a bit unfair Josh that you put me to speak after this guy I thought it was not going to happen this way and you've started something here out which I don't think you know you know with you white guys you cry and you laugh if I start crying I don't think anybody's going to take kindly to that I'm sitting there I'm holding myself I'm saying L please don't cry or else you're going to mess things up Pastor Ray moli um a man who was larger than life respect a man who challenged the status quo I had a closer name for him him and I would always tease him ask him to try and repeat after me which he struggled because it's not an easy name you can ask your neighbor to try say that after me what it simply means is this Pastor Ray was one of those very few leaders in our nation who was focused and had his eyes set on the on the goal whilst others were playing games he never had time for that when it comes to the kingdom issues yes Pastor Art you are not the only one who cried um we did that vacuum is real when I walked in here this afternoon with my wife I found myself asking the guy who was ashas in has Pastor Ray already arrived in the building it still hasn't sunk that we can be here and he's not here physically sitting there but as you said and rightly so what is our loss is gain on the other side allow me not to I'm avoiding this crying thing I don't want to go that way I want to remember the funny things with Pastor Ray that we experienced Pastor Ray was not just our pastor our leader he was a mentor I saw in him what it is to lead in Good Times and in bad times in those early days uh of working closer to him um our country was transitioning coming from the past that we had into this new dispensation and we had to bring that into the church uh I'm not sure if G di kza is in here he asked me the other day why are you no more fighting I said di there's no more reasons to fight we fought and it happened um I remember this one time we were in our meeting um in stin at the Garden Court and I don't know why I still don't have that gift of diplomacy please pray for me I I said something which maybe I should not have said and Pastor R didn't take kindly to that what I said was that Pastor way one of the challenges that we are faced with in the country the political transformation has happened but people's hearts have not changed that much we still battle with racism it was back then ooh I should not have said that oh man I should not have said that that was the end of the meeting he he told me what he thought and I won't say who was sitting next to me on around that boardroom table but someone in this room was sitting next to me and when Pastor Ray kind of calmed down he said where were we you know he takes up the agenda I put up my hand I said pastor R I was still uh and the guy was sitting next to me kicked me so hard on my ankle to try and silence me um but you know what I liked about it when everybody left the room Pastor Ray said don't please come over here and I went to him and he apologized I didn't expect that he said I should not have spoken to you that way that spoke volumes to me I don't care what people can think and say I saw somebody with a heart of gold affectionately he called my wife numsa how is numsa doing and uh I don't know if ch will recall the first time Pastor Ray came to Matata um oh what a disaster I had nightmares I'm telling you I had nightmares I remember this one time it's like someone walked into my house it's a dream I'm watching Pirates beating Chiefs as always and and in the process someone says to me you're sitting here Pastor Reay is already in church you know dreams I just literally I found a broom that took me into the building and when I got there the pull pit was missing and I asked where is the pull pit they said no somebody borrowed the pulit they didn't bring it back and thank God I woke up it was a dream and then the day came that he was going to come visit us oh man we we had your plane ways Pastor um uh Peter pretorius is playing we ched that but a week before I asked the guys how are we going to prepare prepare meals for Pastor Ray and we went to the Holiday Inn in omata we got the sheriff was Italian we said come and cook and the guy said no I'll be on duty so we called his Chef here who briefed that guy on what to prepare a week before we did a trial run we went to matanzima house the state house we rented the house and we set up on this long dinner table and I sat where Pastor Ray was going to sit and we had all these CES you know I had to taste the food and everybody else sitting there and I kept saying to my wife you don't know my pastor when he shows up here all of this thing will be gone I'm telling you through to form he showed up with Josh and we took them to my tma's house and uh I passed the ladies at the kitchen I said Pastor Ray is here and they still laughed but here's what happened as he walked past the dining area he saw the food he said hey Josh look at the food and they walked in there I'm telling you things were flying everywhere oh what a good time we had wow Pastor Ray twice he drove us I don't want to say much but he drove us in his car twice the first time when we was still in der he called me and NSA to come see him and we went and that day he said to numsa numsa I want you to come drive with me tonight I'm taking you for supper I want you to feel how comfortable this car is and we went man Pastor R was driving you know the Indian guys with their at the robot says hey you don't bump us and I'm like oh God because he doesn't see the guy on the other side and we show up at Mount enob at the Country Club he doesn't Park where everybody else is parking he he drives right to the front he's got this massive car he stops the car he did the unexpected he jumped out of the car now you can tell the eyes inside the restaurant oh Ray Mai oh but when he ran around and he opened the door I could tell the guys were asking who is RI driving it was me and my wife what a day what a day that was my pastor the other time you will remember uh G he invited us to danin for lunch strange enough he said drop the car at my house I'll drive you to the restaurant Country Club okay I thought it's a very short drive up until we came back home in front of his gate there was his his cat outside the he stops the car he ask who let my cat out I don't know the name of the cat but I'm sitting at the back I say G do something so G opens the door Pastor R said where you going that cat doesn't know you sit here so there he goes the cat gets excited when it sees him he calls the cat and it it takes off finally he caught it he came back what was missing with the c is get where my C is and G is asking me Pastor Don said I'm sitting at the back he said shut up where are my cookies wow that was my pastor one thing I will take from his life Pastor Ray taught me this he said to us God is not a respector of persons he taught me that not face to face I was sitting at the back somewhere there many years ago I took that into heart and I knew if God has done it for Pastor Ray he can do it for us I want to say this tonight if you you consider yourself a son or a daughter of this house it is Criminal not to love the Lord with all of your heart all of your strength and with all of your soul it's Criminal if you are a son or a daughter of this house you are in Ministry it's criminal to think small you can't you can't go with Pastor Ray and still think small there is nothing impossible with God that's what he taught us I remember those moments my my pastor they didn't have this nice approach you know you get Don where are you um but before I answer he would tell me listen tomorrow we meeting minister so and so in Cape Town I must see you there at 9:00 in the morning if man once I almost drove to Cape Town because the flights were full I could never say no to Pastor Ray but the funny part Josh was when he calls me without fail when I see his name on my phone I just lose my bearings the one time I found myself crossing the river walking I don't know where I was going the second time I found myself under a thorn tree on the road because I felt the trucks that were passing were making too much noise for him the only person who had courage to face up with Pastor Ray is Numa we're going to miss this giant after I preached in your church we had lunch with you your your mom and your wife I came back I said to Pastor Ray Pastor Ray I think Josh is ready to take over Pastor Ray said in his own way get everything in motion then I didn't know what that meant and uh thank God I see you here so it worked I don't know what we did but to the moles and everybody else who knew Pastor Ray our love for this church nobody can take it away from us we are what we are today because of what God did here may you gain strength may you gain comfort and may you know that his sons and daughter are going to carry this Legacy that's our commitment to you amen thank you thank you thank you thank you um yeah wow um I just want to say I I'm sorry Bishop mosa I I didn't recognize you uh officially from the stage earlier and um I was just thinking now um in reflection about the conversations that my dad would have with me about each of you that are on the executive of the ifcc and um you know he was incredibly proud of every single one of you um and um I know that all of you lead very significant churches but you would never be allowed not to lead a significant church with my dad as your leader um and but he was so incredible be proud and touched and um truly truly was immensely proud immensely proud and loved you like his own he really did um in fact even on the passing of I call him Uncle viim it was one of the that was one of the moments my I saw my dad really break he loved he loved anle and we have so many stories we're talking about in the back I truly did grow up with all of you as a part of my story our story and um my dad is fiercely competitive as he reminded me a few months ago no one has an auditorium with 6,200 seats in this country no one must come tell me about who has the biggest church in this country and uh and he would remind me to this day that it's still his church okay so we had an inside joke at Rama to God be the glory to Josh be the blame and uh it's hard to stand behind this Pulpit anyway it it's it's an incredible an incredibly anointed place and um yeah Pastor Charles is going to be sharing at the funeral on Saturday but he came with his son Jared and I grew up part of the holiday Legacy as well as you can remember but um I asked Jared to share because uh he also is pastoring alongside his dad an incredible church and my dad was incredibly proud of him and uh always wanted to see the photos and the images of what was going on on social media and then challenged me why am I not doing the same why are we not growing faster so thank you for making the last few is very challenging for me but um I just want to invite Pastor Jared nean just to come up and share a moment and some stories about my dad well first of all thank you Josh and Tara it it is one of the great honors of my life to stand here in this service to just take a moment to honor Pastor Ray or as I called him Uncle Ray see we're Lebanese and in the Lebanese culture a man or a woman that you respect and admire that is close to you they were uncle or Aunt even if they were not your uncle or your aunt to share the stage with such incredible men Pastor UT who saved my life no joke saved my life pulled me out of the ocean we won't dive into how that all happened uh but Pastor UT and his brother uh pulled me out of the ocean one night over in [Laughter] kakira everyone knows that Pastor Ray has had a decades long friendship with my dad over 30 years I believe if you asked them they would describe each other as their best friend but what most people don't know is that I also had a very close personal relationship with Pastor Ray I can stand here before you today and say that no man on this planet other than my dad affected me on a deeper more profound level than Pastor Ray mccauly I first came to South Africa when I was 16 years old we came to Celebration conference at the World Trade Center I had never seen anything like it and there was this man ray mcau who was bigger than the world it seemed people have asked me how would you describe Ray mcau and the way I describe him is he was like a lion he was bold he was strong he was confident he was loud when he knew he needed to be loud but he was also quiet when he knew he needed to be quiet he never backed down from a challenge he had enemies he knew he had enemies and he confronted those enemies headon he walked strong in who he was he knew where he was going what he was supposed to do and he boldly attacked the call of God on his life one day my dad walked in my room I was 18 years old and he said Jared uh Pastor Ray called and he wants you to go to Africa and spend a month with him and for the life of me I could not figure out why Ry mcau who was meeting with presidents who had a church of thousands upon thousands of Bible School bigger than most churches would pay for me to come to South Africa and spend time with him for whatever reason Pastor Ray favored me he liked me he didn't need more friends are you kidding me he had more friends than he had time to spend with them he didn't need more attention he had the attention of a country if you ever spent time with Ry and Johannesburg you know what that was like if you went to a restaurant with him the restaurant would shut down and watch Pastor Ray mcau come in I remember going to the mall with him one time and the people were coming out of the stores to greet him to celebrate him to shout at him we love you Pastor Ray Raiden need more things to do but he would invite me to come and he would wake me up in the morning and say come on boy let's go and I remember I I would say is is Josh coming come come on Josh is asleep let's go and we would go to the gym and work out and that was quite a sight to behold we would go to the mall we would go eat lunch and you were never allowed to order what you wanted to order you ordered what he told you to order and we would sit and talk and laugh and he would speak and I would listen I may never know the reason why Pastor Ray m favored me but what I do know is that God puts the right people in your life at the right moment in the right season to help Propel you into your destiny I may never know the reason why Pastor Ray favored me but what I do know is the impact that he had on my life I know that he believed believed in me I know that he spoke life into me I know that he inspired my faith I loved listening to my dad preach and a very close second to listening to my dad preach was to sit on that front row at RMA Bible Church and listen to Pastor Ray mcau preach he would stand on this pulpit and he would slap this pulpit and wave his finger and speak on the destiny and the faith of God and he would do altar calls and people would stream to the front he inspired my faith he spent time with me and talked to be about being a man about being a man of God about what it was like to lead and to walk boldly into your calling I may never know the reason why Pastor Ray mccaulay one of the only pastors that you can truly say did not just affect his church and did not just affect his City but he's one of the only pastors to have ever ever lived that you can say he truly affected his entire country I may never know the reason why Pastor Ray mcau would favor me Charles Neiman's son from El Paso Texas but I don't need to know the reason I just know that I would not be the man I am today I would not be the lead pastor of a church of thousands of people I would not be the husband that I am the son to my dad the brother to my sister and the father to my children I would not be the man I am today without without the impact that Pastor Ray mcau had on my life I may never know the reason but what I do know is that I am eternally grateful for the man who is Pastor Ray mccauly and to Josh and Tara I want to say that I am honored to be your friend it has been inspiring to watch the grace of God unfold on both of your lives in the last 5 to 10 years and I want to say to you and I believe that that the Lord told me to say this I want to say to both of you that your time is now I want to say to both of you that you were born for such a time as this we know that God is a generational God he's the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but we know that the blessing and the favor passes from generation ation to generation and it does not diminish as it passes it only increases and I want to say to you and I believe beyond the shadow of a doubt and I'm going to invite the church in a moment to give the greatest amen but I believe without beyond a shadow of a doubt that the greatest days of Rama Bible Church are not behind us the greatest days of Rama Bible Church are still in front of us can I get a good amen and I also want to say that I do not believe that the greatest days of the mcau Legacy are behind us I believe that the greatest days of the mcau Legacy are still ahead of us can I get a good amen I want you to both know and I mean this sincerely that we love you my family loves you my dad loves you our church loves you we support you we believe in you we celebrate you and from across an ocean we will be cheering you on thank you for allowing me to speak today God bless you thank you and we have um many video tributes that have come in some we are going to be playing for you today some are going to be playing on Saturday but without further Ado I'm just going to allow us to roll the video of some of the people from around the world that have sent in their tributes greetings to my dear friends at RMA church when I heard of the passing of my dear friend of course my heart was broken but many thoughts went through my mind I thought of the great life that he lived he lived a full life he was the master of many things when he was a young man we remember him as that bodybuilder that won awards all over the world he was the Envia of very young men and even the young ladies but then he found Jesus Christ and he traded that dream for a bigger dream he became an outstanding evangelist who not only touched his Nation but he touched America and literally touched every continent in the world what a man ray mcau was I remember when the church you see behind me was built and we moved in we wanted to do something special we always have had a desire to change pastors and so we called together a gathering of young men and women who wanted to go into the ministry the building was filled with near 6,000 people and Pastor mcau from morning at 9:00 to 5:00 in the evening and then at the 7:00 Evangelistic service poured into those young men and women they literally sat there with their mouths open mesmerized for hours as he talked to them about how to build a great church how to live a great life how to enjoy the trp I'll never forget that as long as I live it was the master teacher teaching the future men and women of God and by the way many of those went back and built the greatest churches in America today what a man ray mcau was you know in America when one of our great people die one of our pres presidents dies our famous Senator our great humanitarian passes away we lure the flag Oh Glory to have staff and when I heard about the passing of Ray mcau we did something we've never done before except when Billy Grim passed away we have led the flag in Phoenix Arizona in honor of the great Ray mcau God has touched our church because of the life of this man oh I wish I could be there I'll never forget how he loved he was a lover when I preached at his church he was the first one to tell me how good it was sometime I knew it wasn't that good but I needed to hear from him he was a fighter by the way he not only would pray for you if he was your friend he would fight for me that's the kind of friend I want and by the way if I was in a room and needed someone to be with me I want to be Ray mcau God used him in such a great way in many many different areas my last memory when I was there several years ago to speak I remember where he sat and I got to thinking that seat now will be empty and I think maybe you ought to retire that seat like they do a great ball player's number when he passes away that seat should never be filled with with anybody but Ray mcol however he's moved on to another seat he's sitting at the Lamb's marriage supper of the lamb and guess the company he has Moses Abraham Jacob Samson oh I'm sure he talks to Samson about what it took to build those great muscles he might be comparing his with Samson here today Even's a beautiful place streets of gold diamonds jewels in the foundation a gate made out of a pearl but that's not the heaven in heaven for R maali the heaven in heaven is and we shall see his face all of these beautiful things will have to step aside because Ray M coli says take me to Jesus and when he looks in the face of that man that he preached about all these years that he prayed to all these years that he taught about all these years that he lived for and gave his life all these years the heaven is heaven is when he looks in the face of Jesus Christ folks keep Ono Rama the greatest days are ahead of you God has lift you apart of his life his great son and I truly believe that the latter house will even be greater than the former God bless you all to RMA Bible Church to Pastor Joshua and his wife Tara and to the grandkids and all the family and the church family of Rama Bible Church Sharice and I and our church here Free Chapel want to tell you how much we grieve and weep with those that are Weeping Pastor Ray mcau was one of the greatest pastors and national leaders that I have ever met he came to our church and he preached here and I'll never forget the staff meeting that we had with our staff as he began to share stories of meeting with Nelson Mandela and how that all the nation was in transition and there was a voice and a seat at the table for a man of God named pastor Ray mov and my goodness how he influenced that nation and how he has influenced in one Souls all over the world we celebrate him today I some of my Fondest Memories are coming to South Africa and preaching I was so proud the first time I came several times but the first time he ever asked me like a spiritual father asking you to come and preach in in his nation was a big deal it always is a big deal but to come preach for Pastor Ray mcau was one of the greatest honors we love you RMA Bible Church Pastor Joshua you're amazing God's hand is on you and that mantle is falling on your life even greater and you're going to see greater things because that's the kind of God that we serve God bless you we're praying for you and we will never forget the impact of this great servant of the Lord hello I'm K loala senior pastor of World Changers Church International USA and I am so happy to have this opportunity to talk about my friend um it is a painful thing for me to have heard that he's gone home to be with the Lord and yet I celebrate and rejoice his entrance into eternity I knew Ry at as an advocate pleading on behalf of others he was a soul winner I mean the alter calls were always full everywhere I heard him preach he was involved greatly in social change because of his love for God and his love for people of course we know him as a father some grandfather husband uncle brother but he was also human and yet fed and directed by the Holy Spirit he was my mate my friend and yes my joy and a voice of reason when I needed it I remember when I was about to make the biggest mistake of my life and Ministry to ignore the gift of teaching in exchange for an emotional screaming style of preaching because I thought that's what was needed in order to draw the crowd so that I could minister to them and Ray showed up in Atlanta for a meeting and he didn't know really quite what what the purpose for him being there and he came to have lunch with me and uh I told him what I was getting ready to do he stood up from the couch grabbed me and just started weeping and um he convinced me that I needed to stick with the anointing that God had given me to teach the gospel he did it in such a way that uh it so ministered to me and we were both in the office just weeping and crying because I was desperate uh to fulfill the will of God and I was about to choose the wrong path to do that you see if it wasn't for Ry I I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for his his love if it wasn't for his willingness to con to confront me um man and I I decided to do what God wanted me to do because of Ry and and Rey encouraged me and and built me up and and I will never forget his impartation and my life that day so when I tell you he was a friend he was a friend that Stith closer than any brother he was my brother you know I want you to know that we don't grieve like people that don't have hope I love the definition of this author as she began to deal with the subject of grief she said grief is just love that doesn't have anywhere to go and yet I experienced that but through the Holy Spirit I Now understand that I can take this love and send it towards gratitude and I can be grateful and thankful for this man of God this man of faith my friend you know we had a lot of fun together the times when he would U come to America for his tour I mean and I would go to Johannesburg to do a South African Tour and it was from Johannesburg to New York to Atlanta and we spent a great deal of time together and uh I'm telling you I remember this one time we were at a restaurant and I did not know the dude could eat so much so fast it was amazing I saw him put away some big cowboy staks in seemed like just moments and I'm telling you uh we had times where you know they were over to the house and you know Ray got out I had this little little go-kart or something wouldn't start up and he was determined to get it started off so he took his shoes off and and his assistant at the time and and there were two South African white dudes outside pushing the thing trying to jump it and you know Ray was real animated with his hands and you know I'm telling you I'm telling you and and it was just so funny I'm like these two white guys in front yard trying to jump my jump off my uh uh go-kart and and it was just so much fun to see that we've had opportunities where we uh we went on vacation and and Ray would plan this vacation the son's City and um I remember I had my family over and and the kids were with me and and uh we went to Sun City we went on this Safari and he was just telling us all about what was going to happen and then the truck stops it starts stalling right next to the Lions and the elephants and I'm thinking what's going on he was just all excited no no no no no don't worry don't worry it'll be fine it'll be fine you know I did what his say no no no no no you know and I'm thinking it's easy for you to say no bro I'm sitting up here next to the the Lions we went to the bathroom and there was a sign up that said use the bathroom at your own risk and I'm thinking dude we got to get out of here maybe this is just not for a black American to be out here with all these animals you know I'm going to leave them alone they'll leave me alone and we laughed about it just over and over again and the girls were so fond of him that's why even today they refer to him as Uncle Ray h i remember the time where Ry had to have this operation where they would literally cut his body in half but he wouldn't let the doctor start operating until he contacted me for prayer and once I prayed with him he goes okay okay okay and um I'm ready and I thought wow this guy was so amazing in my life and I need you to understand that he was a man he was a human being he had emotions he had feelings and you know a lot of people want to be the great man or woman of God but have no idea how much that cost and he paid a dear price so that he could be a blessing to all of us so tonight I salute my friend I'm going to miss him so very very much I'm on my way to you right now flying over the water to honor my friend my mate my colleague and I salute his legacy his his his life his family I salute the impartations that he has made into the hearts of men all around this world there will never be another Ray mcaulay huh never and I say to him today I salute you my friend thank you for all that you've done I'll see you when my time comes and we'll laugh and rejoice again and I thank God that the body of Christ will never be the same because of the encounter that they had with Ray mccaulay God bless the family God bless the ministry God bless all who have been impacted by this amazing man of God I love you and I'll see you in a few hours I want to take this moment to honor Pastor Ray moli he was a Pioneer and a true legend of the faith when I started out out as a Young Man Pastor Ray inspired me greatly he was one of the few ministers outside of America who built a significant local church founded on faith in the word of God Josh and Tara Wendy and I are keeping you close to our hearts and we pray that the Lord will cause his love and comfort to surround your family during this time but even as we mourn with you we know that Pastor Ry must be so proud that RMA and Redemption Church are in such good hands your father served his generation well now you both have a double portion anointing to serve your generation you are the Benjamin generation and I have no doubt you both are called for such a time as this just as your father shoot the nation of South Africa for Faith I believe you and Tara will be the same for the continent and beyond for the gospel of grace I believe with all my heart that the best days of Rama and Redemption Church are not behind you but ahead of you may you continue to build upon the incredible Foundation that Pastor Ray has laid and impact even more for the glory of our Lord Jesus I was listening to Pastor Ray's last sermon which he preached on 22nd September and he said this in his message The Best Is Yet To Come the best is yet yet to come he said this twice I believe that prophetically he was referring to you Josh and Tara when he said The Best Is Yet To Come you and your generation are that best there are times that even the most articulate of us uh lose sight of the right words to express the enormity of the moment and this is one of those times about 25 years ago or more I made my first trip to the entire continent of Africa to come to Rama Bible Church at the behalf of Pastor Ray mccaulay my feet landed in the motherland for the very first time we had a great meeting several days of preaching and ministering the word of God Great Fellowship uh he was the Catalyst through which many doors began to open to me on the continent of Africa and left an indelible impression on my life I'm deeply saddened uh at the loss of his life I send greetings and condolences and well wishes to the entire Rama Church the mcau family the extended members of that family recognizing that he has left a indelible impression in the world a legacy a longevity that will continue years and years and years after the Lord has called him home somewhere over the portals of Glory he has gone from labor to reward he has gone from the sweat of his brow to the side of his savior may God continue to strengthen you and encourage you with the reality that to be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord there is someplace better than here where the wicked shall cease from troubling and the weary shall be at rest and all the saints of the ages Shall Gather around the throne and be blessed so we do not say goodbye we do not say goodbye as if we had no hope we say so long sir we will see you in the morning may God bless you all well let's give a big shout of praise to God tonight come on Well church it's an awesome privilege to be here tonight Pastor Josh called me last week and he said would you mind singing said would you mind singing but you know my dad who a lot of you may know he sang the song This song actually was a song that my dad used to come to the church just to items this is one of P R's favorite songs and it's an absolute blessing to be here today to sing it you'll hear the lyrics and you're here where human man's heart was related to worship let's worship together why should I feel discouraged and why do the Shadows come and why does my heart feel lonely longing for heaven and home when Jesus is my portion my constant friend is he for his eyes are on the Sparrow and I know he watches me his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me yeah and I Sing Because because I'm happy and I say because I am free for he is on the and I know he watches come on let's go call I sing I sing because I'm happy and I see because I free for he on the I know he watches me and I sing come on I Sing Because I'm happy I Sing Because I [Laughter] fre his is on the and I know he watches me his ey is on the spare and I know he watches me oh he watches me it's uh it's uh one of my dad's favorite songs and uh because he loved the way your father sang it and uh your dad's in heaven for over 2 years now now almost to the day week or so ago and no doubt my dad within a few moments said to him sing that song Lionel but uh thank you Lyon for being a part of this and he's going to be around the whole weekend we have a lot more plans so it's all good you can be seated we have incredible preachers and pastors and leaders in the house tonight and videos from all around the world but I'm going to give a space to in my opinion the best preacher of the Gospel to share with us a few things about his Lord and Savior and preach the word tonight first of all a very special guest someone that's changed countless millions of people's lives I want to welcome this afternoon the Lord Jesus Christ let's give him and there's a lot of people that don't know God the way they should know him and they don't understand him and they have no relationship with him to where they can walk boldly with him in agreement with what he has for my son is 6 years of age I can be speaking to the most important people in the entire city he comes running upstairs through that door to my fridge opens the fridge grabs a cold drink and runs and jumps on my lap and goes hello Daddy and the coldrink can go all over me and that's it why he doesn't come to the door in Elizabeth Ean and say daddy I'm the dust of the earth I'm no good can you help a worm like me now listen I'm getting to something I'm not talking about arrogance I'm talking about knowing your father there's a difference there's some funny people they get arrogant and they think they're in faith in the meantime they're in foolishness and presumptuous and they don't know what they're talking about and they trying to tell God what to do and they refusing to do what God wants them to do so their life's a mess and they're hopeless but what I'm talking about is not that type of thing I'm talking about knowing him when I was in Bible school we had nothing nothing in the fridge no food things like that and it's a good place to be when you learn to walk with God my Earthly father has never let me down once whenever he could help me if I've ever gone to my Earthly father and he and I genuinely needed help that would actually be a benefit to me it would be something that would improve you he would do anything to help me and so I walked outside and was in this little apartment we had and we had nothing and I began to walk around that little apartment I'll never forget it and then I walked outside into the grounds and I stood there and I said God this is the first time in my life I've ever been away from home it's the first time I've ever been in another country to live we have nobody here to depend on but you and the Lord said Son as much as your Earthly father has looked after you I'll be that father to you but the reality is this is that with crisis comes great opportunity with times that people people are in a place of Crisis it's the greatest time that we have for opportunity on the face of this Earth and I'm not talking about this thing about Jesus coming back tomorrow whatever what I'm talking about tonight is this that you've got to have a passion in your life and you've got to have a purpose for your life and you've got to see beyond your own little world and your own little place your own little comfort Zone and realize that there are a people out there that are hurting there are people out there that are destitute there are people out there that are crying for help and seeking the solution to their life and so Nehemiah begins to see the the place that the people are in the destitution that is there that that the people and the wall and the things are broken that their lives are broken and so God placed the vision for the people on his heart he all of a sudden has a burden a Godly burden for his people in verse 4 it reads it was when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned for many days I was fasting and praying before God Of Heaven listen to me there are first world countries today that the people have become Godless and there are churches that will go from week to week without reaching others without getting people safe without touching other people's lives without going into the highways the orphanages the places where people have broken and churches come a club and I'm telling you watch in the next few years there's a shift that has come and God is not going to put his hand upon a bunch of lazy comfortable people that will settle for mediocrity that are going to settle for just getting along in life and he's weting before God he was fasting and praying before the god of Heaven he said I pray Lord God verse 5 of Heaven oh great and awesome God you will keep your Covenant Mercy with those you love You observe your Commandments please let your ear be attentive and your eyes open that you may hear the prayers of your servant which I pray before you now day and night for the children of Israel your servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel and this is the attitude that he has he has a burden I tell you now I have a burden for young people that don't know Jesus I have a burden for people out there on Wednesday the 26th of May Now understand in the context too I've never been in bed for a period of time for a sickness or disease I might have had flu I might have had chest things I might have had something or done something or a knee stitches when a child but I've never been a sickly person so when I was uh on the 26th when I I felt a a pain in my chest I actually thought I'd eaten an apple with the cord you know something I've swallowed some of the part of the Apple that didn't go down too well but but but I knew then that I needed something maybe uh after that pain I began to get into a heavy sweat and I began to to start to sweat a lot I called my doctor and that I wasn't well next day called me to check the symptom if the symptoms had subsided he said look I'll give you a prescription now let me say this to you right now I'm still on medication but I preached three times on Sunday and I mean this from the bottom of my heart I've never felt better I was never stronger and I had no side effects from anything the next day and he I mean he called me and he said has the symptom subsided he later I didn't know this informed the family that he could not get me out of his mind and was concerned that it was a bigger problem than we anticipated and when I informed him that I felt worse the doctor insisted that I should see the cardiologist urgently and set up an appointment in ptor for 300 p.m. and I was actually doing interviews for the World Cup and I missed the whole thing Alan put it on but I didn't see it much uh my brother had it on in the hospital hospital but I went through and I went and he and the doctor said look just go down to the to we're going to do these tests and I should see him and urgently and set up that artment in Petoria for 3:00 he suggested that I get someone to drive me well I've always I get lost otherwise it M's not with me so I always had if I went further than around the corner but anyway I'll never forget him sitting there and going through the test and that and he looked at me and he said you can be dead in the next hour he said I this is the hot surgeon and he's documented everything at dror Chetty and uh and he looked at me as a heart surgeon and he said to me he said I don't know how you're still alive he said you haven't had a heart attack you've had a burst heart a burst heart in 12 places my order was separated and the blood had gone into my chest and so I never had a heart attack it was a burst heart and he and so he said we better get you into the hospital straight away I made some uh SMS some calls and whatever and uh I then was ready to be operated on when he when he opened me up according to the doctor he said he never operated on anybody that was alive in my condition this is the surgeon documented out of 1233 operations that he done that they've done worldwide this is around the world three people survived two that survived out of the three have brain damage they thought I had brain damage because I was in induced coma and the family will tell you that I wouldn't wake up and then they saw a spot on my brain and I said but that was there before I went to grade one the other day when I sat with a surgeon and I'm going to get back to everything else in a minute he looked at me this is a Muslim doctor and he said in 6,000 operations I've never had to operate on anybody as bad as you this is a medical miracle which I've documented it's documented as a medical miracle and what happened was I I I died twice on the operating table I don't know exactly when at what time this happened but I left my body and I was gone and the first thing I'm just going to battle to have to do this accurately and without getting too emotional but the first thing that happened was I looked and I saw sea like gloss and the glory or the sun of an incredible Sunset is how I can describe it became brighter and brighter before me and I stood there and I was in another place heaven is real it's a place it's not a state of mind and the first thing that I thought was am I good enough to come in I was looking behind me I was looking around me and you need to understand when whenever you go through a process in life and you get to a place where you stand before God your first response becomes am I good enough have I done enough have I failed whatever is going on in a split second there's nothing you can do to earn salvation you see the decisions now listen carefully the decisions you make down here determine what happens down here but when it comes to stand before the Lord the issue is only only one thing have you received Jesus in your life the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the grace of God it doesn't contain the grace of God it is the grace of God are you listening to me it is the grace of God and I want to tell you tonight that's the whole issue is that if you understand that he has saved you he has delivered you he is washed you he has cleansed you he's made you brand new he's raised you up as a whatever everything is it's all in him it's not out of him it's not behind him it's in Christ Jesus and tonight I want to tell you God loves you unconditionally and once you understand that it changes your life most Christians are familiar with this passage but not so familiar with the experience you see Jesus's thoughts reflected his intimate relationship with the father in Romans 12:2 do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove listen you may prove what is the good acceptable and perfect will of God isn't that wonderful today you actually can act out on the word of God and it proves God is real it proves God is real in your life and it proves that God loves you unconditionally say amen yeah I tell you it's so wonderful you see unlike the culture around us we're always dragging people are dragging you down to its level of immaturity God brings the best out of you that's five of you God brings the best out of you and develops wellform maturity in you I thank God he does that while works for God are important the work of God in his people should thrill us even more you see the works of God should be the result of the work of God in our lives it's the result it's the fruit that's why your language changes when you get born again that's why you your attitude changes your way of life changes because when you become a brand new creature in Christ all old things have passed away and everything has become brand new I'm telling you it's a wonderful life over 20 years I don't know the exact time my wife was start telling me today but it's about 25 30 years uh I've been serving God and I 40 years he so I try to make it 30 but it was 40 is 40 and I thank God for us it's been a wonderful ride a wonderful experience and The Best Is Yet To Come The Best Is Yet To Come okay you can be seated um he's still going to be preaching throughout the weekend so uh wow my dad has not only had an impact on the church world but also on the political landscape of this nation in the globe I um I grew up as a kid with uh a very unusual childhood which I only real realized it was unusual when I grew up I grew up in the chain rooms of our Sports national teams uh my dad there was no such thing as chaplain of teams he just took over but um was fascinating no matter what sport it was cricket rugby soccer I remember being in a cricket Bible study and uh some of the team quite a few did not believe in Jesus but they were not allowed to miss a Bible Bible study and um he never ever ever preached at people he would preach the gospel in a way to invite people on the Journey of Faith to realize their potential and they loved him for it one of the sports players was smoking a cigarette during bible study and um my dad was asked that does that annoy he said no I just love the fact that he's here but uh in the invictor story The Bible studies were happening so many times he was involved in the areas of our nation where people lived sport business politics not just in the church and I'll never ever forget just the countless times I was an eyewitness to my dad uh living the gospel and being the change in someone's life he could have written many books and told many stories about people and their lives and how they made major decisions around their faith on the other side of his involvement but he never ever gave himself credit he never ever made it about himself he never ever sought to become famous he just was passionate about people reaching their potential and Jesus touching and changing their lives amen amen um we have our first premier in Ken of South Africa Mr tokki squali I would like to ask to come up to the stage to share a tribute him and my dad go way back please come on up sir thank you for being here to share tonight thank you so much thank you whatever I say it's my wife she's the one who gave me the these notes so if I sound like the devil you know who this is a celebration I feel so so small to add a word to the Great past us both here and those that we have heard on the screen across the world to share the same stage with them I'm a nobody I was in prison for many many years not 27 like the other guy I got a discount so yet I feel even more small to touch this pull pit this Podium but I hope whatever was said from this Citadel here for some reason will also go into me and Chang me to make me a better person the person that you saw testifying here from the time when he was standing up like a tall person a giant and you saw him fading away that person whom we are celebrating today is the world of God that's what he is talking about prison he came into our space whilst we're serving just like the Disciples of Christ a lot of them were prisoners not of the Romans but they were prisoners of Christ including the famous Paul and I'll say something about Paul the Paul of the Corinthians he wrote that one from jail Timothy from jail and a lot of his Epistles from inside prison pastors when we're in jail were kept Alive by amongst other people Reverend or Pastor evangelist Ray K he gave us hope he gave us hope so if you think if you believe and think that he was only praying for you how wrong you are here we stand because of this man and of course when we were released from prison 34 years ago with the other man who spent a bit more time than me but we came out the same year who was there to meet us to minister to us to greet us and to show us a lot of love it was the men you saw testifying from this pull pit y man these notes I have entitled a true life of service this is for a brother for a pastor a friend Raymond Ray maau it is customary when we are mour such as we are doing although it is a celebration let's not forget that we have lost a giant a warrior a lover a respector of humanity a man of Peace it is it is customary to invoke during such moments when we are talking about The Departed to invoke their CVS and biographies of course that's a good thing because it covers the journey they have traversed but I think we should get accustomed to not just talking about the past what this one did the school you went to the grades you got or what you failed to get I think the example and the method of celebration of Warriors of Christ such as Pastor Ray it is to take a leaf from their teachings and Define our path forward not just talk about them backwards it's much more useful to take a live from the example of his methods and the method of his example I said a man of peace and the world needs peace today the same peace that Pastor Reay helped us when we came out of jail this country was finished he helped us to hold it together it's not Nelson Mandela it's the prayers that came from amongst others yes the pastor what a man the example of his method or the method of his example from inside prison we knew him as a strong man a body Builder a weight lifter and he admired one of the toughest in the world Rich Park so I inquired from him Pastor Ray from a bodybuilder from a weightlifter you don't know what he said Toyo I am now a builder of the spirit eight yes I continue to lift but I'm a lifter of Sinners to help them for salvation so bodybuilding and weightlifting is the road to Salvation in the name of Jesus the example of his method what teachings did we get from this man both inside J and here when we came out nothing new number one love thy neighbor I have never seen a person you saw him here a fighter to the Finish love thy neighbor as I love thyselves he loved life he admired Madiba Nelson Mandela he urged us all the time to continue with Mandela's message and mission of reconciliation for this nation of nation building social cohesion which we are messing up today to the pastors and others we are sorry especially for the organization of Ness Mandela my own organization which was built in a church in 1912 where are we today in bloom fante the problems of this country and Mankind everywhere as people are rattling weapons including Thermo nuclear weapons but that's what we're facing now peace in the world is under threat the teachings that we get from him during this time for Peace Love Thy Neighbor Palestinians and isra Isis need Reverend pastor maau ukrainians and Russians they need the message of this man I heard a man from Texas Pastor there are elections in your country right now send back this message America was once a colony like us we don't need guns we need America to be close to us we need America as a friend and we we need America as a savior of Peace take up the Crusade we need America as a fellow traveler and developer elections are coming in your country sir whoever takes over it doesn't matter America must assume retake reclaim his place in the world of the country of 1776 when they made their own war of independence the American Revolution to free themselves From Slavery we need America to lead us here as well as a friend send that message sir I know you are a Texan they say there are two types of Americans Americans and Texans I wish you well he has taught us to take sides with the poor and how sorry I am how sorry I am that a lot of the poor who depend on the lestes of this Rama Church lots of them have lost a leader in him he was their savior their Giver their redeemer as a Son of God himself he has taught us to take sides with the bu especially the poor of the poor let them not feel that his departure leaves them without sustenance the spirit of Ray must come down continue to come down like the ray from where he is there must be a ray from Heaven men pointing down here that's the ray that we would like to see don't let them down Rama there are people out there who depend on you the poorest of the poor he said we must take sides with those people people service service is to the Lord the problem the world today is that and I want to say it loud people don't fear God Premier righteousness comes from the fear of God love of God the fear of God and respect for God the problems of today everywhere in the world is that people think they are in charge this is their world they don't fear God the dayare you bend your knee and worship to the one that is up there then the world becomes a better place it becomes the world of Rema the world of ma service means and he said that to me we spend time Lazarus you are here with me my brother we had lunches I don't want to talk about them here Reay should know wherever he is and the ray is on my head right right now but I'm going to say it because we deceived him I deceived him we went to his house we prayed with him so he thought I was there for the food man for the food yeah and the stakes were so good this thing that he can who could Peck away this size of it we packed that away from and I beat him because I didn't have that meat in jail so I fed myself more in his house Reay said the following about service when you are chosen when you're elected into a position whether it's a community body it's a school board it's a sporting Association where he was is an ecumenical committee Church committees government portfolios we have occupied them you can even be a parliamentary and a president if you don't put God in the middle of your work you simply are nobody whatever bodies were elected into around service and that was his commandment to us remember remember service means you're not the boss we forget that in these positions that we occupy we're serving and yet we turn ourselves into bosses of the people who put you there that must change in this country and everywhere Premier I leave that in your hands but as you serve be afraid of God and not to abuse power to abuse people and to abuse positions do not piler or steal from the people people particularly from the Ted bags of women who are poor respect the differences that exist between public persones and private Pockets there are people who don't know cannot differentiate between public money and their private they just take it's about service and it's about honoring the people of God he taught us that that's the message from the method of his example I said the example of his method let's not pray upon people like wolves dressed up in sheep skins ah pray for those who are in Authority that's what one Timothy says pray for the rulers so that they can execute and discharge their duties diligently and with dedication however don't praise them for the evil that they do we pray for government we pray for the rulers but do not praise politicians for the evil that we do Les he gave us a message about money for those of us who from time to time have visited by money or perhaps we visit money as well here's a message for the future for pastor R from Pastor do do not let money to Define you Toyo either personally or your status in society when giving it do so quietly and humbly not for publicity gimmicks and remember he said wealth Whispers but riches shout and they fail yeah there are very few in the world and I'm concluding here because my wife said stick to the 5 minutes you've been given do not embarrass yourself so I practiced in the car when she was she she drove here and we we arrived at 5: but then Lazarus my I'm saying that uh Mrs Zim your husband said you can just go beyond that 5 minutes there are few and I'm going to quote somebody who was an inspiration in prison he was a prisoner too you know this quotation I have to say it here very few people in society in the world can end the following accolades he fought a good fight Paul says he finished the race that is two Timothy he finished the race but above them all he kept the faith and watch word to his son Josh the cross is not easy to bear his shoes are not simple to wear keep rais people the people of Rama as one as you found them and that is to my brother here we were together with him two days ago um there was food he he he he yes I've got evidence when we come he offered us drinks I asked for for cranberry you forgot to offer us food it was there I still have to come back keep the flock of your father as one as you found them here are soft words say when doubt arises when anger as it will you're human encroaches when frustrations overcome and as the knights grow long taals on their Shadows dig deep sir in your brain seek and search for pears in your daddy's wisdom yet even deeper into the scriptures as your father did trust and lean upon the women and men of Rama and more other people with whom your father shared confidences about the good and the bad therein Josh lies righteousness so we say to him rise Joshua rise Moses your father has done his best arise Joshua arise may his soul as we see him away on Saturday and The Souls of many others who are departed may his soul rest in Eternal Tranquility I thank you wow what a powerful tribute ah thank you to our first premere thank you thank you you can be seated everything he said about my dad speaking to politics is 100% true um he was very confronting whoever was in the office regarding the responsibility upon them and was loyal to the people of this country I'll never forget when uh there was a collective voice that had come together to stand against the state capture there was a rally to be held with all the religious leaders and different political parties and everyone at at at this the union buildings in Petoria and my dad was too weak to walk and so he phoned me and he said you're going in my place and I thought I was going to be in the place but somehow he really meant I was going in his place and uh I found myself standing at the front of a rally with all the religious leaders of our nation and um walking there and standing there on the stage and all the speeches and all already and my phone rings and it's my dad watching on television and he makes me start passing my phone to the head of the Muslim faith say okay thanks hands the phone back giving him instructions speaking to me give it to the head Rabbi head Rabbi Warren come here he has this young man walking behind all the politicians everyone's giving speeches and he has this young guy handing but he was telling everyone what to do what to say it's a true story and they wouldn't have taken anybody else's call but they knew to take his call and uh it's been remarkable to see the outpouring of love from much of the political Community have come here to pay their respects across different aisles just to come and say how my dad and everyone said the same thing your father used to come unannounced without invitation hold us accountable accountable to the Bible accountable to morals and ethics and standards and uh that is a big part of his legacy is the church not just staying silent and uh I pray that we can have the boldness to continue that and the favor that we would find politicians who want to work with the church to build this nation with us um we have someone else who's coming to share a tribute someone who you may know as a business person um but actually she has been a daughter of this house and has been in a had a long story with Raymond she's going to come share her story but she sits on our executive doctor patients lingo if you would mind just coming up to pay your tribute uh to my dad this evening and the true story is my dad had a soft spot for her um when we would have board meetings um sometimes she would be coming from far she has businesses outside of cting and she would be late and he would shout at us and for my dad late is 1 minute not 20 minutes and uh but the moment she walked in he was a sweet as pie to her he loved her very much thank you Dr patience thank you very much Pastor I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I would love us to do something that I think is very important behind Pastor Ray there was a woman that made sure that he looks good that he it's well it was not easy for her especially um when he was not well and that lady is Mrs moli if we can just stand up and say thank you thank you so so much amen amen thank you Zelda for loving our pastor to the very end when Pastor Joshua I came to their house found you praying for him and today is very rare to have wives like that thank you so much like Pastor Joshua said I'm a daughter of this house my journey with Pastor Ray started 30 years AO ago when a friend of mine from Zimbabwe invited me to come to church with him it was on the 28th of August 1994 when I made the best decision of my life I gave my life to the Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior in this P pit Hallelujah shortly after that I joined a home cell which was held every Wednesday at bass's house and this group of women that we used to pray together were all single girls and that's where we were taught how to take care of ourselves as young single girls who were believing God for husbands we learned very early that God answers prayers because all of us that were praying together we are all married we are mothers today and I see one of my sister Mrs Zim she was one of the ladies that was saying no ladies you have to dress like this because she she she was married herself thank you so much for leading the way just shortly after I joined the home cell I became very ill and I had to be admitted at Parklane hospital where I was um I had a surgery and a week later I was discharged to go home and recuperate I decided to go back to zanin where I come from to spend time with my parents because I was recovering and when I got home I complicated and my parents rushed me back to hospital in zanin and Pastor Ray happened to call me when I was in hospital in Zan and he said you can't be in that hospital he sent a helicopter to come and get me the helicopter could not go over the makas slof um mountains because the weather was very bad but his determination compassion passion and his love caused him to look for an ambulance to come and fetch me in zanin to take me back to parlane hospital when I got to Parklane Hospital Pastor Ray was waiting there to pray for me that is how much Pastor Ray loved Pastor Ray was a man that wanted to see fruit in his children when I felt the call of God upon my life and I shared with him he allowed me to start a women's ministry in 2013 but it took six years for him to ordain me as a pastor because he wanted to see fruit and even with his dear son Pastor Joshua had to prove himself he was not handed over a church it was when he was convinced that he has much fruit that he could trust him with this church I remember one time Pastor Ray called me and my husband and told us that there was a man that came to him him and told him that God told him that he must take over the church and then he said in business patience and Mike what do you do when you want to buy a company what is the first thing that you guys do and we said well you will do some research do some due diligence and you know and he said why don't you do due diligence even in the kingdom of God because when when a man that comes to me and say God says I must give him my church and he has not even run a church with 500 people how can God give him a church with 40,000 members that told me that he was saying as children of God we must have a discernment Spirit Pastor Ray led us to Christ not to himself we know we know that in our nation there are so-called men of God that have led people to themselves and not to Christ Jesus who have left people um you know economically drained but in this church I can say it with confidence standing here that I've never been manipulated to give he taught us the word of God and the principles of the kingdom of God and we give cheerfully because we honor God Pastor Ray was a path finder a Trailblazer a forerunner of the most powerful charismatic movement in South Africa and the continent as we honor the past Pastor Joshua we also want to assure you that as the board we will support you we will move forward with you we have no doubt that God has called you to lead us you and Pastor Tara we commit before the Assembly of many that what Pastor Ray has Ed the Legacy project of p as a board we will be the one that will lead it by example as a board member I have had the privilege of working with Pastor Ray very closely and it is true that I was a daring of Pastor Ray um one day I was late but I think it was 5 minutes because at the Gate of um I was delayed at the gate and some of the board members felt like oh today is a darling that is late Pastor you must give it to her and Pastor R was saying I can't have this I can't have it she must know it and they said yes Pastor when she gets here you must tell her and when I got there he was sing darling patience sit down patience how is m doing and Pastor way was saying ah Pastor Ray said sit [Laughter] down so one of our board members um bassi uh was tsed to handled the tough issues Pastor Ray did not like injections and doctors and all that so bassi was the one that is always looking for the best doctors and all that and she was always in the dog box I was the only one that has never experienced the dog box of pasor Ray um let us stand together as a congregation United in love Faith and honoring the past while we embrace the future we are grateful for pastor Josh's willingness to serve and lead and we look forward to all what God is going to do through you I also want to give thanks to ifcc Pastor Don pastor muso Pastor Art thank you so much for everything that you have done for Pastor Ray please do not leave us we still need you Pastor Bert thank you so much don't leave us as the RMA family of churches we still need you in in Zulu they say so we will need you to advise us from time to time and we will um make sure that we keep you bre with whatever that we we are doing as Pastor Ray said in his last sermon three weeks ago The Best Is Yet To Come we are not afraid we know that we have not been given the spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind I thank you one two one two there we go sorry thank you Dr patience um we we will be as a family sharing our tributes in the official funeral on Saturday um and we'll be sharing from our hearts all the different family members on Saturday but tonight has mainly been about allowing my dad's friends and family to and colleagues to share um what God has done in their lives through his legacy you know um over the past year and a half we have been talking about the future of our church because my dad planned on being here for the next 20 years it's the truth I don't know I I'd be honest with you uh even at his birthday lunch um with many of the uh American friends that went down for Bart's confererence that came and had lunch with him my dad spent the lunch telling them how I'm in training and for the next 10 years I better not step out of line I'm doing good why I say that is um we've been working on a project called the project Legacy uh together for over 10 years or not 10 years over 10 months 11 months and um he was dreaming about Rama and what it can do and what it should do and what we could do together he was making plans and telling us I mean there's a whole bunch of initiatives that are new for us in this season schools and and a whole bunch of things because he was passionate about the Next Generation and renovating and taking the whole facility into the future but why I'm telling you this is that it all was planned to be released last week and um we've been planning on launching the ray McCauley Legacy um and um I thought to myself what do we do do we stop this do we not do we not tell anyone about this and and the truth is my dad said to me that he he kept saying to me I can't go to Heaven until I see this happen I want to see this with my own eyes and he was so passionate about this church and where it was to go and it scared me how much he wanted from us I really actually yeah I really broke down um my days all mixed up I think it was today actually this morning um because I I had thought um I haven't phoned my dad with the status update on the church this week and told him how many people got saved and and he would really be angry if he didn't get his status update and even more Angry if the numbers weren't good they just couldn't be too good it had to be the best when he was preaching and they were they were the honest truth is the most Dev the most daunting task to do is to take an altar call in the service after my dad or before my dad because there could be five people in the room when he's preaching not that there ever was but all five will come to the front and for other people there might be 5,000 people and five people might come to the front and uh the status update every week first thing he wanted to know was attendance and salvations no cold front excuses no public holiday excuses no 94.7 cycle excuses don't come to me with that but he cared about the legacy of this church and where it was going um and he partnered with me in dreaming it up and um many people have just said how do we honor your dad's Legacy and the truth is if you would be a part of helping us see this Legacy come to pass I think he would appreciate it amen you know honestly my dad hated speaking about money um I don't know of anyone that ever before him bought airtime everywhere he could on every secular TV station with the explicit instruction never asked for money Rama TV was not an income never ever ever ever produced any kind of income it was a mission it was an Outreach but for those of you that are interested we've opened an entire we've taken the old Bookshop and we've turned it into an entire Legacy honoring Memorial to my dad and he was plann we actually planned to walk through it together and I was going to show him all the stories and stuff uh to honor him and if you have time over the coming Days please go through and check it out and um we're just going to show you a short video about the Legacy we were planning to launch to our church we just did this last week and um but before we do that I want to say something about Saturday um for those of us in the Rama congregation I want to ask you please bring your unsaved family on Saturday please bring maybe been praying for your husband or your wife or your child to have an encounter with God for some time allow my dad's funeral to be a a moment for them to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ and let's let's fill this altar with people giving their lives to Jesus on Saturday morning amen we're going to show a video and then Pastor Ray Bavon who has been in the back rehearsing for the last 25 minutes in fear of messing it up is going to sing a song that was one of my dad's favorite songs and I believe it will bless you greatly so uh we're going to just show you a little tribute to the Legacy all the information is uh on the back of your programs but uh we just want to invite you to take a look at what my father was planning to be around to see take place we commit to honor the past by giving thanks to the Lord for all he has done in the past 40 years pledge our loyalty to the Future believing that The Best Is Yet To Come our God is a generational God and his heart is for the gospel to be preached from generation to generation that every tribe and tongue will confess Christ as Lord The Best Is Yet To Come in Jesus name it's so interesting because um even between Moses and Joshua that transition that transition had honor honor towards the past honor to where God has used people to get us to where we are we Endeavor to honor my dad and and the people of Rama for the 40 Years of faithfulness that has existed there and we walk in honor but we also carry loyalty and our loyalty is to where God is taking us and so we're so grateful for how we get to this moment but we also look forward in faith saying God we trust you to take us to where we've never been to take us even better than before and we place our Honor on the past and we place ourselves to Centered for the future there we go going to see this church blossom into a church that is effective more so than it has been in the country and in the communities and in the schools and in the homes and wherever people are we going to be there say Amen somebody this year we're going to grow we're going to be a church of increase we're going to be blessed going in and we're going to be blessed going out and you're going to have to take a step of faith when it comes to what God has for and The Best Is Yet To Come I dreamed I went Heaven you were there with me we walked beside the streets of go oh beside the crystal sea we heard the angel singing and someone called your name you turned and saw this young man he was smiling as he came he said friend you may not know me now but then he said but wait you

yg4ciU3zGbw,Face the Nation | Food poisoning cases/SIU/Kaizer Kganyago/NFSAS/Helen Joseph Women's Hostel,2024-10-17T19:34:09Z,2075,"good evening I'm fundo maalan is standing in for cl manella this evening it's great to have you with us on the sabc now on the show tonight we'll be joined by hting MBC for education madum chani to discuss what is becoming a crisis in our schools The Surge of alleged food poisoning cases the most recent incident of course involved 25 Learners from shulan Maya Primary School in bronos spray who were hospitalized due to suspected food poisoning later on the show we'll speak to kaisa kanyo from the SIU now this year the SIU has saved the South African government approximately 8 billion and recovered the highest amount in their 27e history kanyak will explain how they've tightened their processes to ensure accountability for irregular administrative decisions will also get his reaction to mu's claim that the SIU is a presidential head squat then straight after that we'll speak to nesus administrator Freeman nalo about student accommodation challenges and other issues facing NES F will conclude the show with a resident from the Helen Joseph hostel in Alexandria who will share her concerns about the increasing incidents of rape and robbery that have created fear among women living in that area but first my comment so the safety of children children is now a serious concern following the numerous cases of alleged food poisoning that we've seen it's honestly alarming we were still wrapping our heads around the now n six children who died after consuming snacks then yesterday we reported on 47 Learners from rapo primary school who were hospitalized after eating expired chocolate and then today it's 25 Learners from shulan mayella primary school in Broncos spr who are hospitalized as well if this doesn't warrant serious action I honestly don't know what does we're seeing mec's on the ground when an incident has been reported they're visible we can't take that away from them I mean just today the Mec for Social Development was attending the memorial service of the sixth child good and well but we need a coordinated effort across various government portfolios that will prevent such incidents from actually occurring there can be no territorial behavior of any kind at this point where some say don't overreach into the functions of my portfolio Community safety basic education Social Service Health every needs to come to the party and even put pressure on labs to prioritize the release of the toxicology report of the Ned 6 immediately so everyone can start to draft some sort of a proper strategy to deal with this matter once and for all we cannot fail children like this it's enough now so the question we're asking tonight is should the Department of Education at the very least vet and regulate Street vendors selling food at schools you can send us your WhatsApp voice note on 07845 n1897 7 remember to share your name and surname and where you're sending the voice note from and please keep those voice notes at 30 seconds or send us an a our handle is atore thetion sabc all right we start here this hour hating province is experiencing an increase in food poisoning cases with four reported in October the latest incident affected 25 students from shulan and mayella Primary School in bronos spr who fell ill after allegedly eating snacks from Street vendors outside the school out of the 25 Learners who are affected by the food poisoning incident 22 have since been discharged after receiving treatment Hing MEC for education muman is facing the nation all right good evening MC thank you very much for joining us on the program now MC these incidents are quite shocking but most concerning is their frequency of L today was of course the memorial service of the sixth child from the N incident and now we have this new incident atuan Primary School How concerned are you by the surch in alleged poisoning cases as a department we're extremely concerned as I greet you and your and your viewers tonight we really really a concern because there seems to be a pattern of frequency of late um and and and and that called upon us to come up with ways to really increase awareness so we going be running an awareness campaign in our schools around food poisoning uh and really taking precaution you know teaching our kids to take precautions not to just buy food anywhere uh be careful of food staffs um so so so generally a broad awareness campaign when we say MC a an awareness campaign for children not to buy food anywhere realistically speaking some of these snacks that they purchasing is all they can afford so would the approach be to almost say to children take upon yourselves the responsibility not to purchase from wama outside the school or perhaps you also want an awareness campaign that brings them as stakeholders as well because they are entrepreneurs making a living to say perhaps they also need to be taught about handling food if maybe they are contaminating it in any way yeah no no I agree with you fully that's that's the whole purpose when I'm saying that an awareness obviously going to be an engagement the schools have to take a certain responsibility for instance they are expected as much as they vet people who actually sell in the school the the T shops uh they need to take that active role as well as those who sell with the proximity said proximity especially immediately outside the school premises to check to V those those vendors because we know that this is the only source of income for some for some of the so uh but however we also appeal to them that really really we can't have such an in incident are caring where our kids buy from them and and and then they fall sick they get pois they get this poisonous effects so we so we want everybody the stakeholders to really play a role that that is for those masas because they're adults but schools need to play an active role have you issued that directive now at least maybe to school or sgbs to say Beyond vetting the official Tuck Shop that would be inside the school premises you're now going to have to play an active role and vetting the ones within close proximity of the school and then taking them through safety protocols have you issued that directive now there will be getting a directive to the schools by tomorrow I'm sure because obviously it's from the head office they they arew but in terms of the Ving they've already started this is something that is an ongoing that they are expected to actually do some form of an assessment on who's selling what to the to the kids close to the school um but more responsibility really rest upon those people who are selling you know because they they know where they get this products and and to to a great extent rather uh they needs to be held accountable I mean the person who sold our kids the 25 children the snakes that person needs to be held accountable somehow you know legally within legal legally so that people understand that when they're dealing with food you know especially to kids to our children because our kids are dying from this yeah this this products that they're selling no I suppose when there are consequences it will serve as a deterrent for all of them to take extra precaution when deciding which Goods to sell to these learners but talk to us about them may Primary School case what facts have you established at this point look the good news is that all the kids are discharged all right so they home now which which which really really it was a relief to us as a department so but in terms of the the vendor that sold the to the kids I'm I'm expecting that the school should have taken some form of action to buy them from selling to the school up until they able to demonstrate somehow that they are selling proper food stuff mhm have they given you an update to that effect that perhaps the school has reached out they've had a conversation uh no not not no they've not given me an update to to that extent but I know my schools that as soon as such an incident happened they are the first to really act because they know how serious these cases are how how serious this matter is to us as the department and to the public generally poisoning or around food poisoning so they they would have acted I know definitely as much as I've not gotten a formal communication mhm now many agree that there needs to be some sort of a coordinated effort across various portfolios it's what I was saying in my comment a bit earlier is there any plan where all of you as Government are looking to address this matter do you have those conversations whether it be the health department Community safety or do is there a situation perhaps where others would be operating in silos to say the education department needs to understand its limit ations you cannot go beyond this point you would then be overreaching into perhaps what is the function of community safety are you guys working together as Government yes definitely we we've started having engagement around it but more importantly there's an IG aspect to it so together with the local councils the municipalities we are starting to have an engagement more around putting pressure on the municipalities to implement their bylaws you know you know and that's expected of them but also from our side you know from the side of the department we we ours is to create awareness every home has for a child and we know that we are going to use this reach of children teaching our kids and also the parent body aspect of it around the awareness to how where they procure the foods and the the vigilance and vigilance that expected because it's kids that obviously then you are picking up but the ads also dying from buying this food stuff and it might not even catch the attention of the main stream media or the public to but clearly there food stuff that where they buy this thing parents and kids while adults and children are being affected by this so so it's a comprehensive approach that we're doing as Government but at the level of the proval government we've already started speaking together with the Department of Health and Department of Social Development and community safety yeah in terms of how best to have a comprehensive approach in dealing with this challenge mhm because it would be better resolved if there is that some that sort of coordinated approach because if you're going to create or raise awareness among the Learners you've got to have inspectors though that are going to these various stores where the children would reside because outside of school you would have made them aware in school but outside of school at least they must be met halfway where somebody speaking to these T shop owners to say ever so often inspectors come but then beyond this point today was of course the memorial service of the sixth n child everyone had of course been pinning their hopes on little Gat surviving to assist with the probe as to the cause of the other's death but it was not to be now granted this is perhaps not your area of expertise but have you been in updated on the investigation thus far uh look that the the process what I go so far is that obviously it's a it's a priority a case which the premier has spoken to so in terms of any other updates I would suggest that we take it up with the premier and the commun safety or the safety of the saps to check how far they are with the investigation where we are as a department really it's quite it was quite sad I mean especially because it was on the day where we bearing 80 so so so it was quite difficult it is you know difficult I know that while while the Learners were trying to cope then they get this shock so we have been on standby to really continue to provide support social support that and we monitoring the schools very closely especially the classes that these Learners were we in to see how the the children are are reacting so yeah we are not just going to just pull out that we've come in deep brief spoken to them but we're going to follow up more frequently up until we see that our children have really had it's quite sad really that primary school kids are buring their friends I can tell you now that it doesn't even make sense to them no it's honestly very tragic but also quite commendable the way you've been responding so swiftly because every time as journalists were reporting on an incident quickly the Department of Education is there children are taken to various hospitals with ambulances so I suppose it has been a very difficult time and testing time for the department but yes yesterday your spokesperson spoke to my colleague Bon saying when it comes to as a department you have now become somewhat aware of not just food poisoning cases but alleged suicides talk to us about this what exactly do you know with some cases there um suicide it is a big issue in our currently this it's not a recent phenomenon it's something that we've been speaking about we had an engagement with the with the media to try to really spread the word and and create an awareness so we've got good Ang part with that work us closely but more importantly we we we we we're experiencing especially closer two exams we tend to see a bit of a spike from from from from Learners that and commit alleged suicide because you cannot confirm up until people are able to tell that it is actually suicide but we SE we generally see spikes closer to the end of the exams in particular uh yeah so but we really we really as schools um we are looking at different initiatives Beyond partnering with NGS like sadc which goes to the specific schools where we able to identify that there's been attempts been couple of attemps and those who have actually succeeded in you know committing the suicide so they monitor those schools they go to those schools they create awareness they create they they inform the Learners where to get help and we also have our own helpline place that uze so that Learners can get help so we really try to work around to ensure that we support you know these Learners especially when it's closer to they receive a lot of pressure and and all right MC thank you very much for your time this evening that was H for Education mum Chan now after the break we speak to the SI Ka stay with us welcome back thank you very much for staying with us the special investigating unit saved the South African government about 8 billion in the 20232 24 Financial year SIU says this success is due to effective investigations and Swift legal action the unit achieved a record cash recovery of 2.28 billion the highest in its 27e history in nasas investigation came to around 191 Million by the end of the financial year SIU spokesperson Kaa kanyo joins me in studio he's facing the nation good evening Mr KY good evening good evening to your viewers no it's a pleasure to have you with us so you have saved the South African government 8 billion in the 2023 24 Financial year and 2 .2 billion of that is in hard cash that you recovered just break that down for us yes we we have saved 8 billion 8.4 to be specific M and the first part is the cash in the bank which is the 2.28 billion that you're talking about and then the second part it is the 2.3 billion it is monies that we would have uh saved before they are being paid and because we cancel this contract before they are being paid therefore we you don't have to worry about taking them to court and then the third part I think is about 1.6 billion it's is money where people acknowledge that they have done wrong and they don't have the money they Comm all right they sign acknowledgement of debts and then they are able to to do that and then the last part is contracts that we have set aside which makes a total of 8.4 billion rent MH and which were the biggest culprits or the entities that you would have recovered the most money from it will be ascom it will be at net and then then then it was nsas just imagine having over 190 million R from nsas which is money that was supposed to have been used for students who are deserving and therefore it was taken by student who did not deserve to have that a a child whose parents are billionaires and millionaires they members of parliament they then still go to school with nsas when it is meant for poor people therefore those are the big ones if you look at escom for example you'll remember in the last Financial year we got 1.6 billion Rand from ABB when they they overpriced at at cusil Power Station and they settled to pay back the money and they paid it back and we gave it back to escom so that they can use it now we don't have load setting anymore mhm now you've also among the investigations you've been investigating maladministration and corruption in balanga this is in the health department and it's not the first time that you were there how is that in investigation coming along and what exactly are the issues there because we understand they've been in the media for procurement issues yeah the the last time we were there we were dealing with a different department which was public works but now the new Proclamation that has come deals with Department of Health and in that one it's only one specific Waste Management contract that we are looking into wherein we were the information that we got was very clear that the company that was awarded this contract was not supposed to be awarded and they even got extensions of this contract even after it was not awarded in a fair and transparent manner we are still at the early stages of that contract because you this uh Proclamation came out two weeks now yes and and now we just looking at it but as I say you we start with preliminary investigation already we know what you are looking for therefore it will make it easy for us to then get into it because in the past the past trenches of of programation they were six new proclamations and two extensions including the 4 One MH now you've had to expand your capacity because now you signed a sment agreement to actually conduct uh lifestyle audits in some of the government departments as well as state owned entities how many have you conducted in this financial year if you look at how this matter came to be it was as part of the work that we do as as investigation when we reach a stage where we've got to L look at officials of government and their contribution in the investigations we are doing we then do lifestyle audit on them to understand those people that are living beyond their means all right and then that is how it happened and then when the government Department started seeing the work that we doing they then came and requested us to now do a lifestyle audit for them so not on flagged individuals because from what I'm getting from you before it would have been the individuals that you think to a certain extent would be linked to whatever matter you investigating then you would just have to then audit their lifestyle but now it's across the board now because government has made a decision that lifestyle audit needs to be done especially for senior officials and the ones in sem therefore we started getting requests from government departments Public Works you you get you the process of this world and everybody else the hdas of this world they are now coming to us because they believe in the methodology that we do therefore it is now a new element in the work that we do where we now having to get people whose job specifically is to do lifestyle audit we have had to expand in that area of work and and we're doing well around it because we are helping government to say if this person is is in this department and and most of the people is it becomes very obvious yeah you get to a department or home Affairs for example these people are in lower levels they don't want promotion they don't want they don't go and leave they don't do anything because they make so much more money with the the bribes than they do with the money that they get from but are you able to dig deeper because in such instances we're having this conversation about the lifestyle audits many people will be sure to hide their assets with either relatives or individuals that they pick up on the street to say I'm going to purchase certain things in your name so how difficult is it then in that respect to establish what exactly someone owns or doesn't own we have got a methodology and we are not going to diverge it people try and go around it but the methodology that we have takes us to that because we are able to see even the things because we because we investigating unit we have got access to certain things that normal people would not have access to we are able to follow the money and Trace where the money got got in and where it went therefore we also look around the people that are around you and if your relatives your children children because some of the people pay directly school fees to the school therefore we see all of those things with the methodology that we have and we are able to say you are living above your means you must explain the source of this extra income now many have been commending you for the work you've been doing as the unit but there are those that have criticized uh either the timing of certain investigations and the likes and in particular I'm sure you saw the exchange in Parliament you were there uh where of the m party indicated that as far as they're concerned the SIU is nothing more than a presidential hit squad your reaction to that we just reject that with the content that he deserve and you could have seen even the examples that they gave let's just go to one example that he gave he says no we announced our people of MK on a Wednesday and the president signs a proclamation on a Friday that is not coincident they just targeting this people that cannot be the truth because we would have done the Proclamation months before before these people were even members of of MK therefore and if he had so it was sitting on the president's desk but if you had looked also on the proclamation itself you would see that the president signed the proclamation on the 16th of August it was just gazetted on the 13th of September by the time it's gazetted and we announced the president would have signed it a month or so before therefore that cannot be as a result of the announcement that happened two days before mhm but for the benefit of those who might not be fully aware of the process that would be followed until the president signs the proclamation because it starts with a whistleblower comes to you you do your preliminary investigation from there there's a legal team to see if there's anything here just talk us through that process to that final point where the president signs yes the the act of the SIU that establish the SIU is clear that we can only investigate when there is a proclamation mhm and then what then happens is we get the Mandate or the people who give us the information at the public of South Africa they come to us and then we look at them we evaluate the evidence that they give to us when we are comfortable that there's something to investigate we as the SIU prepare the proclamation it is not done in anywhere else we do it we then take it to the legal teams at the Department of Justice who will then look at it purely to check whether it falls within our mandate MH and then the Minister of Justice will then recommend it to the president presidential legal team will also look at it and then when the play are comfortable they sign but let me hasten also to say since the Inception of the SIU over 27 years there's never been any president who refused to sign a proclamation mhm even if that Proclamation would lead to them having to be investigated a good example of it is former president Zuma who signed proclamation to investigate in M but then what of those who believe that perhaps there would be delays in Prosecuting or at least there being the signature on that specific Proclamation that there would probably be some sort of a delay where you have started the investigation again this is what some might be thinking that an investigation would be started and then it's withheld it's not sent perhaps to the Justice Ministry nor to the president According to some and only at the opportune time then it would be signed and then the investigation begins your views on that because I'm sure you've heard that even on social media people were making all sorts of allegations no definitely there's no such um we we get the we've got an obligation when you come to us as a whistleblower we've got an obligation to update you on where this thing is therefore there's no space in between that we cannot do that there was a delay that happened not generally not because of specific people at at the Department of Justice you remember we are the ones who went public and said we have got so many proclamations that are sitting at Justice that have not moved for some time and and at that time they were not even on the desk of the president and what was the reason on the side of justice that was given to you why there were delays it it was different reasons among others the the stuffing issues and all of that because they've got to go through it because they are a critical component as well because you say Beyond doing your preliminary investigation if you will when it gets to them they must then decide that this is worth actually taking to the president's desk so meaning in that space where there were delays would some be justified to think perhaps there was a delay for an outcome yes yes no the because the only thing they check it's it's it's whether it is in the Mandate and it is basically they're doing that job on behalf of the Minister of Justice because in principle we are giving it to the Minister of Justice to recommend therefore there would not be for that reason we we we checked all the time because we we check them all the time and that's why now when the new Minister came in h credit to her and the the deputy minister they the first thing that they did was to say bring all the proclamations let me see what was the bottleneck and you would have seen in the past month or two we have had more Proclamation than we would have ever had which is quite hening because we're going to get a lot of money back Mr thank you very much for joining us on the program thank you very much all right let's shift our Focus to this story now universities and tet colleges have been flaged as the main culprits contributing towards the late submission of financial statements of the National Student Financial Aid scheme to Parliament high education minister no gaban has vowed to penalize the culprits going forward nasas has failed to submit its annual report and financial statements to Parliament for several Financial years now the scheme says for the 2023 academic period only 50 out of the 76 institutions submitted the required information NASA administrator Freeman nalo is facing the nation tonight good evening Mr nalo thank you very much for joining us on the program you have for several years as nesas failed to submit your annual report and financial statements to Parliament what exactly is going on good evening fundo and good evening to your viewers uh an far has not been able to produce financial statements for several years and the biggest issue uh being that the reconciliation of information between institutions and nsas was behind schedule going back to 2017 and and that's the issue that we've been grappling with trying to resolve in catching up with these financial statements can you just elaborate when you say behind schedule what exactly are we talking about well the reconciliations had not been done and confirmed going back to 20 to 2017 MH and uh obviously when you do those reconciliations you don't just reconcile the total amounts that have been transferred from nsas to institutions you've got to go down to the level of a student to know that you transferred so much for this student and that ties with the student statement at the institution mhm H so have you been trying to address this backlog if we can even call it that yes since the administration started we've been trying to uh to catch up we've gotten all of the submissions now up until December 2022 for the information up until December 2023 um 25 of the 26 universities have submitted and 30 of the 50 tet colleges have submitted m and the last University will be submitting tomorrow mral this is honestly very concerning because when we're talking about financial reports this is a process or exercise to account for money that would be in your entity so if we've got to operate in this way where you're only now at 2022 we do not have any sort of accounting for 2023 it's quite problematic and we even heard the higher education Minister saying that for her there's got to be penalties at this point it is no longer acceptable so what must happen because this is tough talk on her side but you're putting a legitimate case here to say we come from far we were behind as far as 2017 we're now at 2022 meaning you shouldn't expect from other institutions there will be no financials it is it is definitely not acceptable and it is a fault both of nsas as well as institutions a fault of nsas to the ex understand that NS did not have processes for doing these reconciliations on a regular basis a fault of Institutions to the extent that when we then are going to deal with this information um either because of the staff turnover and lack of institutional memory it takes long to dig this information and get it up up to speed and I agree that going forward while we have improved on our systems as NS and on our data we should be able to reconcile these quickly and any institution that falls behind whether nsas or in an institution should Inc care penalty for that and then to the costs of student accommodation you are spending billions of rants towards private student accommodation and the minister again uh when speaking said it's not sustainable how are you looking to address this matter when the the the the cost of taking students to university is definitely beyond that which the country can easily afford So to that extent we do need to make sure that we work with accommodation providers to find ways in which we make accommodation afford affordable and to that end uh in the last year an introduction of capping of the um premiums was introduced and it came with some challenges and now we are studing the students pardon me for interjecting it was the students as well that complained that when you're capping in certain suburbs it becomes a problem because they it it is slightly pricier and they need to stay closer to the university so one would have assumed that in as much as there would be a cap there would be that opportunity to be more fluid where you allow for maybe higher rental amount in certain areas yes there are instances in which such considerations are made but the instrument itself was an instrument that came with a some challenges because those people with lower cost structures were now looking at that amount as a Target amount to go up to and those that are above that whose their margins were squeezed so it does create problems and hence we are undertaking a study to understand the cost structure better and come with a fair mechanism to regulate the rentals of student accommodation and then let's talk about the allegations of collusion at private student accommodation in which we've heard and reported on where landlords increase rent for their game well it is important that people that have got information to that regard bring the information forward we just concluded now beginning of September a road show that we had all throughout August we did hear some of these allegations in the road show we have asked the people making the allegations that they need to provide the information so that we can hold the respective people accountable to this at this moment very very few information has come forward so we would really appreciate that those that have got the information to this extent they do provide the information it is not helpful to have allegations that are not substantiated because it does taint the sector without the possibility of holding anyone accountable so really would appreciate here had you instituted some sort of an inquiry because if somebody or a student brings you that lead if we can call it that then it's uh incumbent upon yourselves to then Institute some sort of an inquiry even if it's one case because you could find actually this type of conduct is widespread where you would have the students colluding with the landlords and then splitting whatever they got out of yourselves absolutely where the where we have information we are following up and we are also following up we've had some contacts recently of some other allegations and we awaiting that information and uh we have the relationship with the Hawks to the extent that these are criminal in nature the Hawks are ready to step in and investigate so we encourage everyone to come forward with the information mhm and then talk to us about the nesus ICT system how's that coming along the the overhaul of the systems will be a longer process uh the challenges that we had faced in the past year relate to the stability of the information that we have an example a student would apply and then would get to a point where the funding decision has been made that the student is funded and that stat ought to stay like that for the life of that application but it would change on a regular basis that would have stabilized um and other metors that lead to the processing of the information uh for payment of of accommodation providers we've again improved the system so what we doing now is to fix it as we go along but the bigger project that has to do with the overhaul of systems will take much longer all right Mr nalo thank you very much for your time on Face the Nation that's nesas administrator Freeman nalo speaking to us more interviews after the break stay with us welcome back thank you very much for staying with us on Face the Nation so the question we're asking tonight is should the Department of Education vet and regulate Street vendors selling food at schools let's take a look at some of your tweets now says good evening to all good evening to you K I think that is a critical must let's remember here we're talking about young innocent souls and people should not risk the life of these important Future Leaders of Tomorrow from in all right Wanda benevolent says that must be done by local authorities such as the municipality otherwise it's too much admin for the education department which has serious problems on its own EC active cundo says inundo after all what has happened the vendors must regulate be regulated now I suppose that's what he's trying to say they must understand children are at risk all right it seems a number of our tweets there agreeing that there needs to be some sort of intervention or vetting of these vendors because at the heart of it is that this is risking the lives of young people so most certainly they need to be protected I believe we also have some voice notes a lot of you have quite a lot to say let's listen unfortunately the government is not doing enough um only when somebody dies and then they they do something but now when South African people act they've been called xenophobic so uh the same food that been sold in the schools are coming from the Pakistani shops so and our people are trying to make a living as well good evening yes the Department of Education must do something before it is too late otherwise people will take the law into their own hands and vigilantism is the last thing that we want to see thank you very much Peter from all right some very interesting views there from P but now let's shift our Focus to this story residents of the Helen Joseph Women's hostel in Alexandria are fearful due to increasing incidents of rape and robbery the living conditions are dire with overflowing sewage broken toilets and leaking roof now today they marched to the hting premier pfi's office to deliver a memorandum of Demands selenaa is a resident at the hostel and joins me live on Face the Nation Selena good evening thank you very much for joining us thank you so much know it's a pleasure to have you with us very disturbing what the women have been subjected to there just talk us through what exactly took you to the premier's office today paint a picture for us of the everyday circumstances of women there at the hostel okay Helen Joseph Women Hostel at in Alexandria this building was catering for women who comes from different Pro provinces working here inting previously it was in good condition and then in this building it's been there for 54 years it started to to be in operation from 1970 until today you can imagine if it was a human being we would be saying 6 years to go for for Sasa yeah yes so now uh we are living in a very very terrible conditions because the sewer line is old it it BL it get blocks now and then we end up living when walking or over the storage some of the storage flow even into the rooms there are people who we have to clean storage in the in their rooms every day under living I mean under normal circumstances I mean it's so disappointing because after 30 years we we in Helen Joseph we don't know what is democracy according to the life that we are living there's no democracy for us and politicians they use us for their votes because with did that building cat over 4,000 of women exclusive of children is a very very big community and then now we have a problem with the muncipality why we didn't take our memorandum to the municipality is because each and every year the budget is being allocated for Helen Joseph Women hostel but we don't see what is happening the officials they use contractors to steal from us they they can so there are never any Renovations there's never any sort of in my in my view is no longer renovation is required because the building is old to renovate it is it just a will it will be a waste of money what is required is to demolish that structure and build family unit for us why we want you because I was going to get to that point now in as much as this was originally a woman's hostel exclusive of women alone you are now parents and some are actually married and they would need that dignity to exist as a family and then and then the living condition it separate parents with their children you leave your your children unattended they end up engaging in wrong stuff so now we want family unit for parents to live with their children to live with their families because now is for women my brother cannot come in yeah I get I get sick they cannot come in but there's also another issue of safety now because we're hearing that women are being raped they're being robbed have you addressed this with the police yes H some years ago there's an old woman who was raped in her room within the hostel she she was raped killed left half naked those who raped her they even locked the room m M and then but how do they gain access so there's that is the that is the thing the the defense is no longer secured we have a problem men do come in the hostel they vandalize the hostel sometimes when you woke up you find the pool of water why the pipes are being vandalized taken to for recycling and then the our passages some passages they don't have lights we don't have lights even in the in the bathrooms in the toilets vandalized you have to go to the toilet at night how are you going to go there you don't know where the people they hide thems get attacked we have women who work night shift when they come back at night they get robbed they get being attacked within the hostel and we do have a security but still they don't Patrol at night because but it doesn't help as you said because the no because the fence itself is not damaged because security itself they don't have firearms the criminals come armed and then even when we even when the this man attacked us we cannot go out because we don't have we don't know what they have you you will go out you might get shot stuff like that honestly we as women in Helen Joseph we live under stress people they don't understand sometime somehow sometimes the way we we react the way we behave is because we are stressed we been crying crying petitions we've been going for petitions we've going we have tried but what has been the response of the police because at least when it comes to safety if we're going to for a second put aside the municipality and what is their role in ensuring that the pipes are working but let's look at the police for now when you've brought this to their attention what do they say remember in South Africa when you call the police they will take 3 hours to come and then the the criminal will be gone by then yes when sometimes we do call the police but it doesn't work for us and then now you decided to head to the premier's office and hand over your memorandum of Demands talk us through the demands that you put there okay um in that in those in those demands number one is all about the Transformer previously in Helen Joseph we were using gas stove in the kitchen then supplied by a guas yeah but it's no longer they we are cooking in our rooms because they they installed the plugs in our rooms the the mistake that they made the Transformer the whole community of 4,000 catered by one Transformer it blast every winter it's the third year now and in the first blast it was severe in such extent whereby the windows were broken and the in the Upper Floor be beneath the the Transformer the the third floor goes up they their doors were disorganized they couldn't close my goodness electricity is powerful people could have died yes but then the trans where the Transformer it is um it doesn't affect we are traumatized by the blast because it's terrifying so then we must on the this year it bless again as I said every winter we experience it Transformer is one of the demands yes one of the demand and another one one another another thing there's a land at k53 they call it a k53 it was ear marked for hel and Joseph as we were told before for the family unit for they said they going to build the FL because remember Alexander have a problem of land that that that site they said they will build flats for us even last year we had a public meeting with our counselor we were told the contract will start by may it never happened and we never get a report of what is happening H yes so now you want them to expedite that process and then start building start building yeah and then we want the hostel to be turned into family unit that is about main issue now is what we want because now we live like a prison we are in prison we lock in we lock ourselves during the day during the night because we're in fear and then another thing we need uh the security they need to bring the security and armed security and that those people must come those who do who will be doing night shift they have to patrol they they we are not saying they must be standing all the night no at least they must rotate to minimize this vandalizing and this those people knocking on our doors at night at some might if they know that security patrol they will they will no longer come because they will be afraid to be caught so who received your memorandum in the Prem office H at the premier's office there's a a representative that received it yes gave them how long to respond we we stated that within 7 days we need the respond and our ention is we we going to take our cry further and further we will we will also go to the president's office we will also we will also approach the minister of human settlement why because we need solution and we have a we are we are there we we see the disaster that is coming and then for last time there was a heavy rain there four blocks this ground floor D1 E1 fub1 G1 there was flooding they couldn't go and the water get even inside their rooms even myself I was affected it took me some hours to access my room because there was water everywhere no you're very brave but what we will do is most certainly to pose these questions to them you say you've given them seven days we'll see as soon as those seven days laps if they've communicated to you we'll take it from there to find out exactly what they plan to do to address these problems because you've put those demands to them you want them to expedite the process to build the family units we'll find out if that is possible at this point you also want to be secure yes and beyond that you want them at the very least where you are now that it's a more habit habitable place to live not at all if you so you look oh it has yeah but the pictures pass the the St no it's honestly not a very way everything is broken and another thing previously they everything was quality all the contractors those come there to work Joseph they bring cheap material our tabs were not like that they bring Plastics once which will work for two weeks and then it's broken Selen back to squ back to square one Selena thank you very much for joining us as we've committed we will reach out to the premier's office just to find out what exactly they'll be doing to assist the women at Helen Joseph and that's where we leave it for tonight enjoy your evening further good night thank you so much all right"

91_Wylimqs0,Explain and Verify | 17 October 2024,2024-10-17T17:58:32Z,591,"you know what that means it's time for explain and verify now soon after assuming office president s Raposa committed government to raise 1.2 trillion Rand worth of Investments over 5 years today we're here to explain and verify how much of these investment pledges have in fact become real Investments s well B according to the DTI investment pledges achieved during the investment mobilization Drive reached 1.5 trillion exceeding the Target by 26% president s Raposa has since set a new investment committing to raise 2 trillion Rand worth of Investments for another 5 years however let's look at how much of the pledges have actually materialized into the sou African economy bong at this point in time we look at the pledges and the various sectors the total number of projects are 3177 that is 1.5 trillion RS that exceeds the Target by 26% that the president had said projects completed to date out of these investment drives 124 that is 318.50 billion Rands that is already completed and that's into the economy of the country projects under construction at this point in time are 90 that is worth 4833 3 billion Rands worth of projects currently under construction projects in early stages of implementation 52 that is 338.15 5.2 billion Rand worth of projects currently delayed or on hold private Finance this is particular sector finan by the private sector 18.8 billion Rands that is private Finance DFI is foreign direct investments into the country that is 16 2 121.6 billion Rands worth of projects currently coming from direct foreign foreign investments announcements of additional projects that amounts to 55.7 billion Rand B and that is some of the projects that are currently being rolled out by government in these investment pledges of President sirel Raposa and of course I'm Keen to see the pledges by region and how these ones are looking if you go to the second graphic bong and it will tell you particularly if where the Investments are coming from we've had an investment strike by South African businesses over the past nine years or so of former president Jacob Zuma's years in office then ultimately the new dawn came into South Africa's political sphere with the emergence of s ra maposa as the president of the ANC and ultimately of the country that for that domestic investment strike was seemingly curtailed with New Hope and Investments coming into the country domestically out of those particular plages of 1.5 trillion 55% come from domestic companies that have invested in the president's Investment Drive 45% bong come from foreign direct investments into the country so at this point in time we can safely say that these pledges of 1.5 trillion Rands that the president has gotten has been of those companies that are based domestically and business people domestically 45% come from foreign investors then we go into the regions bong which is our next particular slide it will tell you that the European Union EU that is 47 pledges that amounts to 13.9% then you go to to the United States of America which is South Africa's second biggest trading partner that goes to 17 pledges at 5.3% and you look at the frosty Financial relations and trade relations and political relations that have been there with South Africa and the United States of America particularly how South Africa has been seen to be more leaning towards China and Russia and the South South relations particularly with the expansion of bricks the bringing on of Iran into the into the bricks formation and other countries that are not seemingly aligned with the United States of America you remember it was Saudi Arabia whom where president Sosa in his last trip to that particular country broker that deal I remember we had traveled there as well for Saudi Arabia to join the bricks formations then South Africa's biggest trading partner they've got 10 pledges that is 3.2% also if you look at South Africa's economic trade with China it is largely skewed in China's favor and not in South Africa's favor but China is trying to appease South Africa by saying that they are willing to import more finished products from South Africa into their Market in order to balance the economic trading skills between the two countries Buu and of course there's been quite a lot of focus on that relationship and how maybe the scales might might need to tilt a bit but s how much does the country need particularly when it comes to Investments for desired growth well B with that particular question let's ask some of the expert whom are in that particular space in econometrics Dr AAR J very good evening to you Dr jine how are you this evening I'm I'm very well thanks but I've been uh L by the network uh in the entire area I don't know the telom network is broken down to speak yeah it's okay it's okay we can get through this particular discussion in essence doctor how is South Africa how much Investments does South Africa need in order to get the economy up and running again and kicking on all 12 cylinders you it is such a critical question that you are asking what has happened what has contributed to the decline in South Africa's economic growth performance over the last 15 years has been a decline in the level of investment from 24% of GDP to a low point of below 133% of GDP two years ago it's now up at 14.8% of GDP the average of Emerging Markets excluding China is around 25 to 28% of GDP in other words double the level of investment that we are currently uh putting into the economy and if you include China well the figure goes up to 32% so uh we have to basically double the amount that we're investing in the economy and the big question that I ask is with all these wonderful numbers that have been produced about the pledges for investment why has our capital investment been falling as a percentage of GDP and dragging down economic growth from what it could otherwise have been right until the present we are just not seeing the impact in terms of the figures on capital investment that we ought to be seeing the construction sector sector is in the absolute do drums hundreds of thousands of jobs are being lost but we are not seeing the manifestation of these pledges in actual business activity when you look at these particular pledges president rapos has achieved that 1.5 trillion Rands of pledges into the country are we seeing that domestic economic powerhouses that have been on an investment strike particularly during the era of former president job Zuma are they finally releasing those particular balance sheets and flowing the money into the economy once again well a lot of it has been going abroad and many of our top companies are finding it more profitable to uh operate abroad than in South Africa and secondly we uh there's been one must be very careful about talking about an investment strike because as much as I've been talking about how investment has been falling private sector investment has actually been rising as a proportion of that total level of investment the real line in investment has been by government and the public sector especially state-owned Enterprises where they have just where the funds that they should have had available for investment have been eaten away through State capture over the past uh decade and a half that is the critical reason why we are not seeing an upswing in investment escom doesn't have money to invest there's a there's a distinct program now to build 14,000 km of transmission lines for renewable projects last year we succeeded in building 74 out of those 14,000 kilomet of transmission lines transnet is supposed to be raising the amount that of the volume through our ports uh which have declined from 228 to 145 tons per year in the last six years there's very little sign of that picking up uh as yet so we just not seeing that investment by state owned Enterprises taking place and attempts are now being made to try and attract private sector involvement in trying to ameliorate the situation but then that is being opposed vehemently by uh the Trade union movement so we're getting we're not seeing the progress that we ought to be seeing when you bring up the issue of transnet you look at some of the Rail lines particularly going into the rard bay terminal and going into the geran Port as well what are some of the huge bottlenecks that the private sector is Raising with government with those particular Rail lines being dysfunctional being destroyed particularly during the era where covid-19 had struck and the country had been on lockdown and that infrastructure was delapidated you look at the number of trucks on the roads as well well it's the problem started long before Co actually but covid obviously exacerbated it all and what we've seen is a lot of sabotage so that people can fill the metal for a bit of money to live off uh well the the Rogues and then you've had a lot of extortion also um uh interfering and making it extremely difficult for these uh attempts at trying to rehabilitate the infrastructure itself and the rail network which are some of the economic sectors that attract most of South Africa's foreign direct investment into the country looking that our ports are largely used to import these particular Goods you look at the dysfunction ity of some of our roads that block the N3 some of the countries within the setic region and the African continent that use the Durban port and the and the and the rich Bay C terminal as a Gateway into the Eon into the market in the world they've diverted into Namibia some have diver diverted into Mozambique you you've explained it very well there uh what are the sectors obviously the motor sector the agricultural sector uh where we've lost a lot of ability to export especially in the Citrus industry the wine sector um as well and uh of course um you know more generally uh you know it acts as a deterrent for business generally to come into and out of the country uh and obviously we've lost as Fortune of money in not being able to exploit the surge in the coal price uh a couple of years ago because we weren't able to export as much coal as we could have when the price was at record levels and that kind of uh um obstruction is still prevailing we hear every now and then of uh moves to attempt that there's some success here and there but I look at my charts and the latest figures and they show very little Improvement yet that is why we the economy is not picking up as much as it could have been doing now in the absence of load shedding and with and in the face of increased uh interest in the country following the formation of the government of national Unity when you look at South Africa as a trading partners China is now South Africa's largest trading partner and China has expressed it wants to import more finished products from South Africa what are some of the sectors that South Africa should be focusing on in order to meet China's commitment of those finished products particularly when you look at thec it says that they can no longer be exporting dust and rocks into the foreign markets as opposed to it rather beneficial ation and exporting finished products well obviously there's processed minerals that if mineral if we could beneficiate minerals more effectively and productively and if and cheaply we could be doing uh exploiting that the motor industry has been a Cornerstone of our industrial policy I don't know whether China wants to buy South African motor vehicles uh in the way that the West has been doing um that's a possibility and then of course agricultural products more than anything that is where we can really export largely into China and make a killing and our wines and uh and citrus and other deciduous fruit that is what we should be looking at but our ports are blocking that and have been rated to be amongst the worst in the world and that's why China is moving to other African countries uh to exploit that South Africa's potential is enormous if we could just unlock some of these bottlenecks but uh we're struggling to do so State capture has done an inflicted a huge amount of damage to the economy over the last 15 years and it's remarkable to see that the perpetrators of State capture still being supported by such a large uh portion of the South African society thank you very much for this particular discussion Dr interestingly when you look at the exports and imports between the trade relations between South Africa and China there is a lot of influx of Chinese vehicles into the South African Market at this point in time and if you look at the automobile sector of South Africa it's been largely dominated by brands from European countries from the west and that will then bring about the question what do these manufacturers particularly of Western countries European countries what do they do with strengthened trade relations between South Africa and China with that influx of of finished Chinese vehicles into the South African Market as South Africa exports most Vehicles into the Western Market that are built either in East London PE or you go to the automobile Capital within Kang which is 20 and of course s all of this I suppose now puts us in the place where we now need to look at in terms of the percentages of these particular pledges and how much of this 1.5 trillion has actually materialized wellong where the department of dtic there has said that there has been some progress let's look at some of these particular total investment pledges that have flowed into the South African economy that have been received 61.6 billion Rands is already in circulation within the South African economy about 40% of the 1.5 trillion rans has already been received and that will tell you bong that there is some sort of progress but that progress is relatively slow particularly looking at some of the economic problems and energy problems that the country has faced escom has not been performing well it's only of recent months with Dan Dan morani having taken over a CEO of escom and Mr mat miti has taken over as the chairperson of the board of the power utility that we've got a surplus in energy generation over 200 days without any load shedding within the country business activity industrialization where their Industries is taking place and that brings about some of the issues that the president has said that South Africa must reindustrialize you go to former industrial H industrial hubs of the country I'll bring you a textile manufacturing Hub which was an area in the Eastern Cape deaza those particular factories are lying fellow now you look at how the textile industry within the country has basically been dilapidated and you find more foreign products coming from the Chinese into the African Market some of these particular products has been deemed inferior some of them have been uh stopped particularly in South African ports by customs and that will then tell you that the South African economy is very complex there are problems that are there but with energy security and energy generation it will give you a guarantee of a country that can reindustrialize and particularly with the private Public Partnerships that are taking that are taking place and also with the new Power stations cusil and also uh it's Cil and mupi that are already coming on stream as well I've seen in some of our reports where we reported on cusil some of those particular generating units are all on stream at this point in time you look at how the kuber nuclear power station is also being revamped and the minister of electricity and energy within the country he is also going out on tender particularly for that 2,600 megawatt uh nuclear power station that will be brought on stream in order to Fast Track economic growth within the country and of course we often hear about these green shoots but maybe another area we need need to look at is to take stock of the textile industry and really just look at the bloodbath that has been there but thank you so much Sam president s Raposa mentioned that while there is a broadly positive attitude towards South Africa among investors the country's foreign direct investment of 1.4% as a percentage of GDP in 2023 was slightly lower than the global average and work needs to be done for South Africa to attain sustainable growth and that's how we wrap up been and very fun"

number 10 amen for e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e s s amand in 19 19 and all the braest in the area actually came from from from this place as the center for activities very very strongly there was a time when I became dis African National Congress I think that time must say I can see that thec and the ANC leads I actually at some point even did not renew my membership I want to confess and I stayed for maybe two two years or so but something came into my mind and said but what do you think happen uh I think it was yesterday when I I watched see Inca I saw JJ interviewing Tito I don't know if some of you might have seen that previous interview very very critical issues were raised in that in that very very serious ises so I not had time to to discuss with him some of these things that he actually raed in that interview there was you know that time unfortunately to discuss that but has been raising very very fundamental issues that thec should look but said the will never die said will never die because there are people who are currently working in ANC and would make sure thatc lives on and continue we are here today I think we should also this is where he spent most of his time of his life if you to count the years that he spent with us in the family you will find that I don't know whether maybe how many maybe 20% of the time that he spent with us the rest of the time that he lived actually we spent in the his home so for the work that you did raising him up we we are a family that actually is very very broad a that has a a lot of tributes and we actually believe in what we do basically uh some of you might might have seen that we are not very easily influenced we're not very easily intimidated that is what he was those of you who know him will know that you raise an issue to discuss you must know that you must must he must be very ready to win the case but you will never win I can tell you he will you will with any case with him so we we simply want to say to you your your K di left today we received the delegation at the veterans and I today I was also very happy let me say I saw real veterans today real one we see we see all the

listen to you telling us and feel that we actually H know that our TI was in safe hands we are going to uh I think people will inform you about the right that are going to to unfold until until Saturday I think that that this that task will be handled by some some other people today here but we want to have this process that is going to flowly we challenges that serious because challenges will already there but I think the thec is capable of doing anything and anything and everything so that we we at the end um have a proper V for you he has always been saying he want he wants a very dignified funeral set and I think to do that we know is going to be able to do that live up to that what he is actually requested you will be going to where we coming from and you will see where he was born as you drive towards graveyard you see uh on on on on the road on your on your on your on your right there's an area where he was actually currently developing for some other work that wanted to do even when we would want to see that project going on and I think it only happen if if you get support from from from from from this world organization the African National Congress which is your Serv um I don't want to take look of your time uh I just want to say thank you very much for keeping him in your family staying with him like I said was a very was not a very easy person to to convince as long as he he's convinced this thing is correct we will have to explain things um I know the leaders ship of the of thec U he has been saying lot of things about the leadership sometimes

what the things happened especially for him thank you very much we are now entering a strictly political terrain where we going to receive messages of support from the leagues of thec as well as the Revolutionary Alliance at this point point I must submit that this part must be regulated we' have allowed all the preceding items to flow as they were but at this level comrades you will bear with us we have attached to all leaders who are going to give messages of support a self regulating button they will press that button when they finish their 4 minutes each and to that extent the order that they going to come in will be as follows without any Interruption thec Youth League led by com Oliva Munda the provis secr of the league in the province will start with his 4 minutes he will be

as s were having a concern with these Abate names of leaders these these leaders who serve during apartate who are still who whom their their names are still existing in our towns in our libraries in our institution now these names are still traumatizing us so is a challenge to us so we are saying we need to challenge these names and replace these names with our leaders some of these names we must name comrade dto B like bers there are so many names in our towns in Louis Richard everywhere so they are still reminding with that history whether was we are in gnu but we must engage this issue it is possible even face is possible in honoring him again comrades in honoring him were calling the government that let's work together in creating jobs for our youth for our community members here

so allow me to deliver this message from workers As We Gather today this afternoon to pay tribute and honor to this great comrade and leader the Federation would like to deliver revolutionary greetings from Mark CH house in buan coincidentally this is mar sh sub region and we are from Mar sh house in pan heavy hearted s workers we are grateful for this opportunity to pay tribute to such an exceptional comrade and leader the Federation would like to recognize comrade Tito's tremendous and outstanding contribution as the first Democratic minister of Labor of the first Administration he was from Li and he's from limo he was chosen amongst the best but to represent workers not only workers Val workers of South Africa Comm I think he deserves a round of applause for them his potential Excellence convinced president Nelson Mandela to appoint him as a minister of Labor 1994 1994 fresh from the box young as he was and he was there it was during his ter of office when labor laws were drafted the basics on minister of labor now can strike at any time if we feel as workers we are not taken care of we apply for a legal strike and we strike as long as it is legal we strive we can join unions maybe just to name a few the labor relation act 1995 basic conditions of Employment Act 1997 remember 1994 to 1998 it is the time when you was minister of labor employment Equity act employment Equity act 1998 that was in the skills development act year 1998 much has been said about the struggle that he under went let me not go there this labor laws were put into place and implemented during the time he was a minister he showed dedication for his life to liberate the workers by promoting Fair Labor practice protecting the rights of workers and ensuring safe working condition through this very same labor laws we have got occupational and safety act so you couldn't blame com because there was a l that was protecting you it was up to workers and the unions to make sure that they Implement and observe to make sure that those laws are indeed adad to com's Passion to liberate South Africa and working class continued throughout his various deployment in government later as South African Reserve Bank Governor then Minister of Finance by com T is the first black man in South Africa the worst part the most wor part understand accept he's the first black man to sign Bank notes from limo from M region from Sub sub region Mark shop let alone they talk more about he was a role model to young ones the young one he was a model to young ones because he he wanted people to be educated let me not go deeper because the the youth leag has talked about that he was also playing a role of a erer and a statement today workers enjoy their various rights like forming and belonging to unions he was there when net was formed he influenced it it is a lecture for another dayi we'll come and talk about net all the above were among the list of his initiative and achievements he was indeed a selfless leader and a comrade South Africa the working class is presently vulnerable and need leaders of comrade's caliber and character more especially during this difficult times of government of national Unity the working class needs leaders who will protect workers through effective economic policies protect workers from this new liberal economic environment of austerity measures which do not guarantee job and food security so we want leaders who will be a protective layer not leaders you will feel in the missing we about the leaders we need leaders at the level of of the municipality the level of the province the level of national ministers who do not have that isy you end up stealing what is rightly yours to such an extent that you might warrant admission to check if ever are you still okay so if you've got that tendency you are not the leader to lead the workers in this time during this time of government of national Unity we need caders who will not loot from the poor but ensure Service delivery to the community caders who will protect from even getting into the government of provincial un how are you immediately after the elections we used to say we are 73% and we are okay when we boost to other provinces because the ANC in this province got 73% victory in comade Tito the Federation agrees that we have lost a selfless activist fully dedicated and focus Soldier surely workers will remember him for his revolutionary contribution to the labor community and economic development of South Africa our deepest condolences go to the family friends the tripartite alliance and the South African citizen at large he will surely be missed and may his revolutionary may this service bring Comfort to everyone during this difficult time may his revolutionary soul rest in Eternal peace am thank you am long the of long live the spirit of long via African National Congress viva viva South African Communist Party Viva Viv program director National Congress the leadership of our leagues thec Youth League the provincial secretary comrade Oliva the leadership of the women's league comrade momy to be the leadership of the veterans League the chair person of the alliance the chair person of s Co present here the chair person of the Federation and all the moners who gathered here received revolutionary greetings from the South African Communist party in limo the German poet B bre wrote a poet and he said in that poet I mean in that poem there are men who struggle for a day and they are good there are men who struggle for years and they are better there are men who struggle for many years is and they are better still but there are men who struggle for all their lives and these are the indispensable ones and as the Communist party we look at within the category of the indispensable ones because from a very young age he dedicated his life to the struggle for the liberation of our people and at no moment did he leave that commitment to see the full realization of the objectives of the freedom chter and indeed the realization of the national Democratic Revolution when we were concluding our Central Committee as the South African Communist party on the 13th of October we learn as we were starting the meeting on that last day of our three Central Committee of the passing of comrade and we have accordingly in our Central commit statement sent our condolences to the family as the Communist party we looked at the critical role that com played firstly during the Str of our people we look at com not just as a revolutionary but as an internationalist because that Journey that he true to move and go into Outside Lands whose Safety and Security did not know but armed with one mission that I want to go and join the struggle for the liberation of our people and I will only go back to South Africa when our people are truly liberated not only reflects the life of a revolutionary but also an internationalist in that particular context the Communist party has celebrated comrade ditto's life but also outlined and uh looked at the Legacy that comrade left and in that particular context comrades we as the Communist Party would call upon the working class because comto was a son of the working class we call upon the working class to make sure that we are able to defend the Legacy that he left within the context of the progressive labor laws the Labor Relations Act the basic conditions of Employment Act the employment Equity act the skills development act and a whole range of those and we are making that call specifically looking at the moment that we are as a country looking at the state that we are and the better content of the message is contained in our statement but the critical moment that we are it's a moment which we say it's a strategic set back for all the Revolutionary forces in the country by us getting only a 40% support accordingly the leading organ within the alliance established what we call the government of national unity and we should be clear here comrades firstly with regard to the position of the South African Communist party with regard to the government of national Unity We Stand opposed to those that will say is expressing his his personal View and that is not the view of the Communist party we disown that every time when the General Secretary of the party speaks he is speaking a party position and that party position says we had many other option to follow we had many partners to go to bed with and this one represent exactly the direct opposite of the Gaines of our national Democratic Revolution actually after the collapse of the Nationalist party there is no structure in South Africa that represent white interest that represent white Monopoly Capital which when we going to the elections went even to report us to America that they don't trust our election that they will be Democratic except for this thing called the da and we stand oppos to them our post as the South African Communist Party comates within the context of defending the leg of is that we should be able to transform the financial cyle during this month of October we have loed what we refer to as the Red October campaign and at the theme of that campaign we are saying that we must tackle the cost of living crisis that is here in our country and we must implement the national health insurance now we are making that call deliberate comrades and I'm happy the leader of the delegation of thec is part of the national executive nothing about it but just to send a message because in that national executive there are those that are opposed to the Implement to the implementation of an act of Parliament that is meant to improve the conditions of Our Lives me and you who are coming from a working class background they stand opposed to the implementation of the national health insurance and we are calling upon the president of the Republic and the inti of government to make sure that because it is an act of parliament now it must be implemented in the same breath we are calling upon president Raa to act against the minister of basic education for having publicly undermined the president of the Republic once you join the executive of the Republic you put away your narrow party political interest and it was a public embarrassment for the minister to not participate when the president of the Republic was signing but at the same time on that day we were addressed in this is the sadest moment com de about this thing called the gnu we are addressed from time to time and they being told fellow South African by B John of all people I never imagined myself that one day I will stand and be compelled to look at the national TV because a leader of the da is speaking and we were subjected to that and I don't think com would have been happy with that as part of the defense of the legacy of comto we are saying that our movement our government must champion fundamental financial sector transformation campaign and part of that campaign will be to make sure that we end up with a state bank and we are pleased with the progress that has been made at a provincial level the intention to resuscitate a bank that collaps but with an intention that it must be able to serve the interest of our people and we are saying this because at the state where we are financially in the country especially for the waiting class very few can be able to AO I mean can be able to afford firstly to access a bank a loan and so on and so forth with regard to the commercial Banks but secondly most of our people are trying all manner of activities that they are able to survive within the context of the financial sector and we therefore believe that the state is the only savior in that particular regard comrades we are meeting at a time a very difficult time in the movement and in the country where the generation that gave us our freedom is leaving us one by one just 3 weeks ago the country was morning the passing way of comrade brain godan one who contributed so immensely to the liberation of our people today we are convening here celebrating the life but they will be laying the Mortal Remains by Saturday of yet another giant of our struggle to comate to the family and in representation of the current generation of that is

was actually honoring young men and women that were actually getting their their certificates from doctoral until to the lowest level and one of my daughters was receiving her her qualification very bubbly very energetic and looking forward to make more contribution apart from the task he was doing in one of the best universities that has produced the brain thrust of our country which was formerly known as meduna at a particular point when we received the news as an organization as the village where he was born in the province here our country the continent and the world were all ring with shock and we still ring with with sadness as I was saying to you this province we must congratulate the PC led by com St Matata who who whose our thoughts and prayers are with him at this stage that he has lost a pillar in his life the mother the leadership comate madash is our PS Dr have been there to support these comrades later today we also got news that one of the leaders of the ANC from this province com moraka has lost a family member in other words the PC we have represented as well and we must thank you we must also thank you that through your own work we have engaged his Excellency our president president s rapos that he must honor this giant one of the finest revolutionaries of his generation that our movement has produced on Saturday you will Bid Farewell by the country in the highest recognition of an official state funeral and want to say thanks to thec the leagues in the alliance as the ANC were celebrating the extraordinary life of this remarkable freedom fighter and a nation Builder who dedicated his life to the svice of humanity when the story for freedom and the struggle for freedom is written the story will be incomplete if there is no chapter dedicated to comto Titus Moen and his generation that generation in the adversity of the brutality of upper dat when many men and women were being mimed and killed both in our country and in Exile where black people and Africans in particular they became a paria in the land of our birth comrade ditto and his generation they made a choice a very very difficult choice because for each generation there will come a time when they have to make choices one of the choice they had as a generation he could have pursued education here in our country and lived a better life himself and his generation they understood that in an abnormal Society like South Africa of that time it was inconceivable and untenable that they could fold their arms they had a choice either to submit to the system to continue to treat us as subhuman in our own land of birth or they should make a choice to stand up and fight comrade even if he came from humble beginnings from that humble community and around these other Villages here when he was at the University he made a difficult choice that he going to fight because we too are not subhuman in the struggle for freedom he got to lose certain privileges comrade ditto was kicked out of our country he had to join the struggle for freedom but comrade ditto because he was always courageous very strong and brave and insightful he managed to DARE the aparate regime he went to a country within a country there's a country we respect so much with resilient people the kingdom of L A Country within the stomach of a country called South Africa What A Dangerous Mission comto made a choice to join other Freedom Fighters while the very same time pursuing education the aparted regime was very bold was very powerful with all the arms and ammunition at the time in including the nuclear capability but even with that might of the state comrade dito and his generation they were able to confront the enemy they look at the enemy through the eye and our comrades they never blamed even in the adversity when a number of people lost their lives in masero when they were killed when a number of comrades and activist including our freedom fighters they were killed here just next door in Muto in mozambik those young men and brave men and women they were prepared to lay down their lives which was the premium that others they paid for our freedom there therefore when people speak about comto and his generation you must know they were selfless they made a sacrifice and they were prepared to lay down their lives for me and you to be free today and enjoy the freedom and the conditions of Peace but not only to free only Africans and black majority but also to free the oppressed because also the oppressed through the efforts of our people they were free comrade Tito and his generation when a settlement was made that it is time for us to negotiate a settlement on a conflict that has been there for centuries and when negotiations were supposed to start comrade dto as young as was a revolutionary Young Lion and other young Lions the ANC infused them as part of the negotiating team at that particular point he was one of those who are looking at the economic prospects especially because the economy of our country was racial it was actually having gender issues where many people whose B in our land of birth were not allowed to have access to our economy including the mineral endowments that to able to say this is an economic policy for the ANC that's the story and the contribution that must be written of our s Heroes and heroins on a journey we have made since the tragedy of 1652 happened in our land when the country had to be rebuilt from the Runes of upper dat and colonialism comrade ditto and his generation were the first people that his Excellency comrade president s president Nelson Mandela was to be able to say they are ready for the task irrespective of their age they look at the capacity and the task at hand that to build a new government for all the people of our country in our journey to build a truly United non-racial nonexist Democratic and a prosperous country because that's the kind of a society we all agreed that we y for and we Aspire then this generation of com did they to put put the building blocks they to start a journey of Thousand Miles today is 30 years since that first step that was taken because that Journey had to be started when they came in the government was segregated there were many many Administration there was corruption there was inefficiency there were no records many South Africans their rights under the sun were not respected comto was given one of the most difficult task where the majority of our people in terms of the social means of production our job was to be the hairs of wood we must fetch water we must do this we must do this but we should not be involved in the means of of production because of the color of our schin our salaries were not going to be the same because of gender issues and women were the worse of and at the very same time workers had no rights the operate system had use the labor laws of that particular point in time to indicate what are less than human and we must be subjected to humility and in Humane conditions and comto with a young generation of comrades at the time they started what we call it the department of those older than me when going to go there on those particular areas you get to be sent out you go and work for many many years and you don't come back families are being dealt with for the first time there was a Labor Relations Act who that whose role was to be able to regulate the relationship between the employer and employees also to ensure that their rights because workers rights are human rights and we produce one of the best labor laws under the Tut of comrade at the very same time the condition at which workers were working there were different conditions that were given to workers on the basis of race on the basis of gender including on the basis where you come from the region comto had to put the pillars of an important document called basic condition of Employment Act recognizing that we must have a leave the right of maternity paternity all these other rights clearly stipulated but then we're inheriting a country a country directed issues of inequality where we to forge Justice at the very same time that to actually devise a transformative law to change the landscape around opportunities especially for those were previously disadvantaged that law is called the employment Equity act and many many people today here who are part of the M Strat who are part of those that are well off including this one Speaking here I'm a beneficiary of that legislation and many of you we are the of the building blocks that comto and his generation to today that is his contribution later on the Revolutionary Alliance especially the working class the fact of the matter that comto was honest was candid and you will tell as it is it must never diminish com dito's contribution around the fight for the vulnerable and the working class in particular they might have been different of opinions on other matters when we're in government around these issues but that chapter no one can equal the chapter of the foundation that was laid around what you have today the baring Chambers the netl all these other important aspect that's the contribution that we want to say to the family G and want to say thank you we appreciate that you gave us one of the best comto when the government of national Unity at the time was falling apart remember thec won the elections because the ANC is always magnimous Nelson Mandela a unifier a nation Builder even those who never got the support of South Africans he invited them in into the house when he invited them in at a particular point they could see that it was too hot in the kitchen because Nelson Mandela in the ANC they gave them a chance to participate in the gnu of a time and comto because thec had confidence in him but not only the confidence the NC was knowing exactly that comto was per Excellence he had the capability he had the knowhow including the we with and the attributes that he can assume the next responsibility comto was then dispatched by our movement your organization myc he went to the South African Reserve Bank one of the most important instrument that the economies of the world are using to oversee the monetary policy and show the stability of the economy and the currents comrade firstly he became an advisor later on he took off over from crystals for the first time we're very proud as a black child child growing up in a village of this beautiful Province for the first time a note WR TI Governor a clear Testament to say where do you come from doesn't Define what you become but it also says to you never forget who you are and what where you come from and what you stand for because if you don't have those bases we are whole we are artificial comrade ditto with his style he was able to take the RS the rent never fell the markets never got to vetar he brought stability one of the most important issue is our appre ation of the role of central banks and their independence because if they are not independent they are going to be subject to manipulation and the markets are very very very sensitive it needed a stady hand he never wanted the matters around our economy and monetary policy to be dealt with under the table comrade Tito always understood that he was in the service of humanity he opened the Reserve Bank its operations and decisions to the scrutiny of our people for the first time there was an introduction for South Africans to understand why the landing rate from time to time it must go up it goes down what are the conditions comto was a Pioneer firstly he Pion the current packets of legislation around the working class rights now he was transforming the economy and comto did an excellent job even today the investors both at home which is domestical and international even whatever the storms the country have gone through but they appreciate the independence of our institutions and also the predictability of the macroeconomic policy and comto and his generation and those after him theyve laid a foundation even this government of national unit for us to have the inclusive economy will look at that particular point com worked tireless at a particular point he made a choice that he want to participate in the economy he left government so that the struggl of economic empowerment and the struggl to transform the economy it it needed men and women of caliber to take that task but while comr dito was doing the national Duty around the economic sectors comr dito remained true to the Revolution and our home thec never at any point comto abandoned thec he was able to continuously to contribute in the structures of our movement until his last breath because comr dito was not belonging only to us comrade dito belonged to our country he belonged to our continent and comto belong to the world his work is a testament to a power of grassroot and one's ideas where you can make a difference firstly in one Village that Village of epod including the famous area called makas makas is the most popular area in the world from your Province someone was not ashamed to put makas on the map the juk of makas made that difference that difference ended up being a difference that was making in the continent and ultimately in the world when the African Union which was a successor to the organization of African unit it had many problems our economies were not growing the organization was not properly rationalized it was always having African leaders from now and then in terms of our own sovereignity they will go with a with a cap in a hand going to back an International Community comrade ditto was appointed by his Excellency president kakami from Rwanda when President kakami was given an opportunity to look at the reforms of the Au he worked with some men and women of Stasia from our own continent because we believed that for our African problems the African Solutions and comrade Tito played a pivotal role how to sustain our Union our Union is very strong around matters of governance around issues of Peace around issues of development including the integration of our economy because the borders we have in Africa they artificial were one people were one people in as much as we we don't want to say there must be any person who comes here illegally people must come here be able to come and do trade and come and visit and grow our economy and we form bonds and partnership but those who come illegally we don't want to agree with that those who do crime crime is crime irrespective of nationality comto was at the center of building an African institution the Au has still some weaknesses I'm relating the story comrade it's not a fiction is a contribution of this bow tree that has fallen that we must celebrate comto was an internationalist comto was a pan africanist he was Building Bridges amongst Nations but com was not satisfied he continued to represent our country and our movement he was one of the best that we could export his skills most of the serious challenges around financing in the world whether by the Breton wood institution whether the international monetary fund the World Bank the issues of the World Trade Organization comto was there on the table because you should know comrades if we are not on the table there's a risk that you're are going to become a man on the table like president of Kenya said if we are not on the main table you might be there as a menu you can be actually be devoured he pushed that these conditions that were being placed on Africa and other developing countries they were unjustified they were not fair and the trade relations and the trade imbalances that is the role he played even how South Africa was having financial difficulties comto will look at the best mechanism how do we deal with our own deficit in the fisc so that we can have money to fix some of those things as I say many of you comrade ditto has directly and indirectly affected your lives even those who never came across him comto our movement thec has gone through turbulance when the ANC went through turbulences comto at a particular point of an unfortunate incident of State capture corruption and the destruction of many institutions and the country was not doing well economically and the cost of living was very very high comr Tio was asked to go and put new clothes and assume a responsibility of a Minister of Finance in our country his Excellency com president Sosa asked him to come and assist us with his stady hand and his Spirit of voluntarism comrade Tito was there again he assumed the Reigns in 2018 as our Minister of Finance when comto assumed that particular rain a pandemic struck there was covid-19 many many people died in our country and Global many of our people they lost livelihoods they lost jobs many many businesses they close down comto working with his team the division under the guidance of the president were to respond on how to save lives but also to protect livelihoods the country had to produce an inclusive blueprint that blueprint was called economic reconstruction and Recovery plan because the the economy was performing below the targeted range that economic reconstruction recovery plan including the stimulus that were there and the packages that were given up to save the workers those who were actually getting unemployed and the provision that were being made comto was an au and he to introduce measures measures to ensure that this escalation of the deth this depth must be contained because we don't want our children to inherit a country in chaos those other choices we to make others in our own ranks they call comto and others by names that we are putting austerity measures without the appreciation how a national FAL must be managed and the issues of the B and hard choices to be made those hard choices they might have caused necessary pain but it's a shortterm pain that was necessary so that our economy could not have continued to be in a Jun state so our economy could have been in a position that those who have the resources will have the confidence to invest we still have the capability that those goods and services that we're trading with the world we can push our exports but also those Services we never had we could also encourage Imports and our economic framework remain one of the most stable one it might not have given us the desired jobs comrades but it had given us the necessary stability that is a contribution of comto I want you to look at that particular lens comto even at a time when he told his Excellency the president in thec that now that he came in to be a kaker to stabilize a shrinking SE a sheep he could see that the Titanic was starting to float again and he went to thec and made a plea that it's time for me to move and continue the journey because my task was far from complete thec allowed comito a leave of absence from government then he took new responsibilities when he took those new responsibilities comto was not ashamed he was not embarrassed where he came from he decided to come back to this beautiful Province to the environment of am makosi and the other villagers to enjoy the warmth and he understood that these communities of makasu a they too Under the Sun are human beings they must be lifted comto understood what it meant about Local Economic Development the economy is not going to be developed in Ivory Towers it must be built up organical from the bottom that area has became a t a tourist destination of choice and please the people of the province keep Mak on the map and the roads are very good com noala the scenary is very beautiful we must develop that particular area so that this economy can multiply comr Tito was not satisfied he understood that the generation of Nelson Mandela Walter suu president tble there were never threatened by young people they were never pulling young people down like it's happening today where those that are having price SPS are being destroyed comrade dito comrade oliv made a choice to say let's develop the next generation of leaders because those who are living today those who are living here the country does not belong to them they are just the K C they are the custodians the country is an inheritance of our children children children comto spend more time around issues of educ ation supported many many young people because he understood the value of Education that a child from a village one day could become a president of our country a child from a village on the basis of Education can become a first governor of a democratic South Africa comr Tito understood comr Tito understood that a villager can go and sit in the world economic Forum with the richest nations in the world whether the G7 or the G20 he knew that if the potential of our young people is harnessed they are not given hand outs but they are given a a a lifting hand to a platform he invested more time on education including to improve the quality of B basic education and secondary education many many areas one school was making a testament of a poor performing School com ma around the 50s when he came in selfless he made a contribution that performance of a school is currently above 80% first3 we always doing well M that's the contribution as I was saying to you I had an honor to be with him on the 27th we had a long discussion my daughter was graduating with mathematics then you know some sometimes they have many ideas what to do and comto never missed an opportunity to teach but allowing young people to flourish and make choices of the next steps that had to be taken that's the story and the life of comr D but those who belong to the ANC and the Revolutionary Alliance comrade dito was one leader who never divided the ANC he was a true Congressman congresso understood you don't join the re ution for yourself Revolution when you revolutionary we a kid you must love Humanity more than you love yourself and you can't be the first only you to benefit like the current generation of leaders who are the first every time it's about them not the people the NC is an organization of the people and the ANC was made by the people as a response the ANC is not bigger than the stru and the ANC is not bigger than the people the ANC is an instrument of the people to change the conditions and comrade Tito and his generation they understood what is the ANC they understood that Revolution giat they also understood that your movement and my movement the AMC it has a bigger responsibility to build a country and a nation that we all Aspire we know that racism issues of gender chauvinism patriarchy and all other ills were the faulty lines of our country and comr ditto understood that you can't lead a divided nation when your L and our L the freedom chter that says we must build a country that belongs to all who live in it comto understood he never only understood he only also walked the talk of trying to unite our people trying to make us to live in conditions of non-racialism not on the Bas of the color of the skin but non-racialism even around access to Opportunities and access to wealth comto hated chauvinism today were renowned as a country that abuses women the elderly and children and the killing of the innocent but also com was a Democrat you know retion Alliance those of us who are leading today we don't have a monopo of wisdom even those of us comrade Goodman that are in the government of national unit I'm not the best Deputy minister of what but I must understand that my strength is harnessing the potential of our people the ANC does not have the best Solutions but thec understand that it has the best opportunity to mobilize all South Africans and create a platform for peace for prosperity for democracy to thrive that's our appreciation comto he was very energetic he had a silver T he spoke in such such a way that all listeners they felt included and edified comrade had an ability how delicated the matters were comto usually knows how to clarify matters and clarify them to a level where everybody speak never win a debate and lose people it's an art of leadership comr was very Fierce very competitive and combative but he never looked down on other people he will push them he will nudge them to think at a higher level he will nudge them to look at problems from a different end he will push us to think he will force us to read he will ask questions asking questions stimulates the Mind comr Tito had an amazing ability to get the heart of things he always listened to what they to say he will always offer wise counsel when appropriate but he'll also sprinkler the conversation with his brand and hum he was always Jo understand that's how work with us his Cel as I was saying was always sought even on personal matters you know there are many young revolutionaries in the organization we go through many trials and tribulations those of us who are still young not too young com madash were leading thec were not saint were F were just mere mortal mere mortals we do make mistakes comrade Tito you could confide in him the ANC and the alliance especially the veterans lead you must create a safe space a safe space where confidently young people and young leaders when they go astray they can be given cancel not to be trti not to be destroyed there are many many people here we all make mistakes and the ANC does not have dpin comrades we must account for our misdemeanors but we must be built because the more you know when you have a mistep is part of learning will find time will not respond here there is an alliance secretar comrade Goodman in as much as we are different organizations it's an important matter we must discuss the ANC we never said we love the gnu but in a struggle they are detour they set backs when they are set backs we have to make choices the country was crying for the leadership of thec the people knew even if the ANC made mistakes but when it was tough business everybody they made calls to say where is thec because they know that the ANC is the only instrument in their hands that carries their dreams aspiration and hopes no other organization and the ANC always have an ability to rise to the occasion we Rose to the occasion we saved the country from the edge of disorder and Chaos it's a technical choice we made the ANC must be loaded that we brought people that have different views and enemies both in terms of ideology and other people that called us name for the first time time we brought them together Under One Roof under the genu we brought them Under One Roof is not a small M you know the fact that we brought People Under One Roof do you know that we achieving the tenants of the Freedom Church the tenants that the country belongs to all who live in it we brought people together who are achieving what we called Unity of our people for a common purpose but from time to time there will be ugly heads and differences that will be made it will be incorrect that when the ANC made this strategic choice we don't want we don't have problems with criticism but criticism must be objective we can't started to call thec is a sellout organization in other words we are feeding to the notion and the opponents of a national Democratic Revolution now we are seeing the instrument of the people is a sellout that were are pushing new Neo liberal policies we started to Define people people when you start to Define people you call them names we have lost the plot comrade dto even how sharp the debates on economy how sharp the debate inside thec comrade dito never reduced himself to a level of calling people names we can criticize people we can criticize the policies of the ANC is an organization of the people but don't call people names counter revolutionaries they con a new term an ANC of rapos when it was their time in the ANC they understood that the ANC is a collective singing out a Leia has always been the strategy of the St com the St com they will go for the leader character assassinate the lead tell more lies and More Lies until they Lies when they are repeated they can be seen as a truth those of us in the alliance let's keep it alive vibrant this Alliance was not an alliance of leaders where we came across and put deals around the table the alliance was cemented by the blood of our Matas Our Heroes and heroines sung and unsung in the trenches and were also binded together by our minimum program the national Democratic Revolution as I close thec despite the setback in honor of comr dito we must renew our movement our movement is not in a healthy position when thec is coughing the country catches cold the ANC is not for you as members in South Africans the ANC belong to the people of our continent the people of the continent they look upon you as South Africa and your revolutionary movement thec if in the world on International matters even if we got our democracy towards the tail end they look upon us how to resolve problems we resolve the problem of Iran of um Ireland the shin we resolve many many problems and South Africans even today they are the peace ambassadors there are those who are also fighting for a sustainable environment the ANC must be renewed when we renew thec is not for those of us in leadership so that the NC A Renewed one it becomes a renewed instrument in the hands of our people A Renewed ANC is going to renew the country because the others we have they don't have a vision of a country we want not a single Party stand on a platform and say what kind of a South Africa are we building all of them they share the ANC dreams and aspiration that only the ANC has a proper Vision let's deal with issues of arrogance corruption deal with issues of where you think that we are entitled let's remain humbled let's work hard and stop mediocrity let's be disciplined all the time and be Nation builders on behalf of thec we want to say comto has fought a good fight he has ran his race it's time to allow him to rest it's time to allow him to rest now he has joined the galaxy of revolutional the finest one in the world is joining president oo Nelson Mandela lilan GOI Peter Muka the list is endless the heavens have got have got a new Angel if In Heaven There was a qualified audit report com tto skills might come in hand just to fix the books in heaven so they can get a clean audit when the monetary policy because heaven itself is an organization and institution it must have good systems and everything they might actually have a new Reserve governor of a bank there because even Angel day must be taken care therefore on behalf of the ANC com noal your child in the South African map the way you raise this child as a society you will never be forgotten but our biggest task is not to continue to cry for com D what we need to do we must produce more detos letes in this province in our country and continent let them

cI1_B2l9WJ4,Gauteng water crisis looming: Gugulethu Quma,2024-10-17T17:25:07Z,4454,"yesterday we brought you a protest by the Westbury Community members who said they were complaining about intermittent water supply they claim that this has been going on for weeks now at the same time there are concerns that infrastructure failures may lead to day Zero so is that the case jisur water operations manager Kul joins us live now good afternoon to you and thank you so much for your time before we even get into um the issues around of course the hit wve and how that's also impact the infrastructure let's just talk about this issue of Westbury the residents are claiming that they've been without water most of the day at least for about a few weeks now and they say that they only getting it at 1:00 in the morning um and that's when they only able to do their laundry and all of that and it only lasts for an hour is that the case uh good evening and good evening to um sabc viewers yes um we do have challenges in particular on the system you are referring to uh um which affect communities of Westberry and Associated we always do that communication because our Commando system which is supplying that area is currently constrained and during the course of the day we do we are unable to supply the demand that is coming from that system and we are able to recover at night hence the community will receive water at night and during the day there is no water in certain parts of that that area thank you so is it only for an hour it's difficult to measure that because um water systems are quite Dynamic it depends on the day and at times because we are recovering most of our systems at night during the course of the day we supplying large areas normal Supply communities and the businesses and all the customers that are supplied in particular from Commando and the area that is supplying U uh West um the area in concern is a air steel um reservoirs and those reservoirs are quite constrained we have to do some interventions and reconfiguration so that at night we are able to get as much water as possible to that system so it is possible that at times there will be water um for for a few hours at night and but other days we will we are able to supply the area through throughout the night in particular up to the morning when we receive the morning peck so I'm going to get to interventions in just a moment but help me understand if someone goes to work during the day and they possibly don't get water or somebody is at home during the day they don't get water and they're only getting it at 1: in the morning and that's when they can only do whatever that they need to do how sustainable is that definitely not sustainable and it's a quite an inconvenience to the customers as you've alluded too and we do not Pride um our um Supply um in that in that form because we're supposed to be supplying um in fact our mandate as janas spe water is to deliver water and sanitation services to all the residents and customers within the city of Johannesburg it is unfortunate that right now in that area we are constrained and we are behind as far as infrastructure renewal as well as the upgrades that we need to do so definitely in the in the area we are referring to we need to add additional capacity which the project is currently ongoing but right now now we are struggling to supply adequately to all the customers hence they are affected are you behind because of money or something else indeed if you look at our business plan um just last Financial year alone we were already at 24 billion r as far as um the backlog is concerned that is telling you all of us as a residents of the city that now the backlog is a result of the underinvestment over the years and that has been anding if it's sitting now at 24 billion that's quite a huge number to catch up and it's now manifest as far as um these challenges and Water Crisis that we are referring to so it sounds like somebody was sleeping on the job have heads rolled I would not necessarily say uh somebody slept on the job but but the reason pardon me let me Let Me Maybe explain to you why I'm saying that if you're saying that this is because it's a project that needed to be done over a course of years and we are still here where people are being told that there's a backlog even now and possibly they're going to find themselves in the next couple of years with still backlogs because we have heat waves we have water leaks and everything else that is currently going on right now so if we are still dealing with problems that started a number of years ago it sounds like somebody was not necessarily doing what they's supposed to be doing if if we view it from do we have plans to get the infrastructure upgraded yes definitely do have plan do we have adequate funding to get that capital investment in the infrastructure now the problem is there because now if you were to ask do we have plans yes we do have plans but if you ask are we getting a adequate funding for those plans and those programs that needs to be H implemented the challenge is actually sitting there so it's difficult to say somebody is sleeping on the job but it is the challenge that we are facing right now where the infrastructure now is unable in particular on the area we refer to which is a Commando system is unable to deliver um the water to the customers and now other customers are affected during the day and we wish um it's in the Ean and in the environment um the city is a is a is a urban environment and we wish that all customers receive water from the de but currently now we have to augment that system with a water Tangers which is not ideal for the for the um city of Janes so who needs to release more funding for you city of Johannesburg is responsible for the entire infrastructure within the city and Johannesburg water is a agency that H deliver water and sanitation so is it the city that needs to give you more money pardon me yes thank you the city is the one that is um allocating the funding to Joanna B cour all right we'll have to have a conversation with the city to understand what the plans are there but um I ask this against the backdrop of what um you know I prefaced this conversation with Ren water raising the alarm about excessive withdrawal by some municipalities particularly when you think about um you know the fact that there's a hit wave um you know sometimes and people do use a lot of water around the time and now I wonder if your cers are not able to handle the work that you need to do what then do you do in this situation as well because the weather is also posing a challenge it's definitely uncomfortable that we we have to use UNC conventional means to to to arrest the demand that you are referring to but when we arrest that demand through the water demand management intervention it means there's going to be inconvenience in certain areas where now there will be no water and we have sometimes to close some of the system we already closing overnight so that we can be able to have uh capacity during the day but if you look at the release that you are talking about generally from the audit the the not drop and the the blue drop that you are referring to um most of the cities are currently aaging at 33% physical losses remember I'm not talking about the non-revenue water at all I'm I'm looking at the the portion of the non-revenue which is the physical losses that talks with the leaks pipe leaks the B the reservoirs that are also leaking and need to be rehabilitated we currently sitting at about 26% and if you looking at our peers or other metros and other municipalities the average is sitting at 33% we're not proud with the 26% because it's way high and the international Norm is way below 18% and we need to bench mark below 18% perhaps because there will always be losses in the in the water system but we need to reduce that to acceptable Norm so that we are not um bleeding water throughout the streets and the uh best in the suburbs that we always drive and seea water when does that happen when does that happen to put that that plan in place I ask this because the issue of the leaks um both where we can see them and where we can't see them underground sometimes has been a concern for years now even on on Monday I was in conversation with the deputy um minister of water and sanitation David matob who was raising a concern even like what you're saying right now that the leaks are simply also adding and further compounding the problem and there's an urgent situation that needs to be resolved in that regard so when do these plans kick in so that that residents can have a little bit more confidence in the system you if you're looking at the infrastructure and the underinvestment that we were talking about which comes from years and compounded to a 24 billion rent now that tells you that our pipe replacement program is also quite at a slow rate than K right it does seem like um we lost him there somewhat but um as you hear the system is constrained um and it does seem like other areas are without water kulet I'm not sure if you're back we lost you there for a sec my apologies about that I I think I'm back now yes you are so you were saying that the underinvestment is also further compounding the situation for you so can residents safely say that day Zero has come at day Zero we we we not anticipating Z at any given time if you're looking at the complexities because our systems are interconnected but the the city of Johannesburg is supplied by three uh different um go ahead go ahead we can hear you I'm not sure I'm not sure if I think I got cut we we could we could still hear you we could still hear you you were saying the systems are interconnected yes the systems are are interconnected and that gives a flexibility that we do know you will always hear aen of um aen of P station it affects a certain area of the city if you're looking at the other area palmet is supplying the certain um section which that will be your sent in up to Mid Rand and if you're looking at the CBD Johannesburg Central is also supplied by another system Z copies so we do not anticipate that all those systems even though they are interconnected but they are also independent to some extent so we do take that flexibility as giving us a opportunity to say we can escape day Zer but now the issue is there is a consumption the consumption is unsustainable we should be consuming as far as numbers are concerned slightly below 1,500 megal a day as a city of Johannesburg we're currently averaging at 1,700 where is the 200 megal coming from because now it needs to come from that system and hence we need to put water demand management interv to arrest that but it comes at the cost because now it will inconvenience most of the customers so that we can bring our consumption to the acceptable levels you also asked a question about the infrastructure that is bleeding the the the the pbes that are bursting and all that yes we calculate that now as a demand even though it's not going to the customer's propert it doesn't necessarily mean we're building the customer but when we're looking at the holistic consumption of the city we also add that because because now that consumption is the water that Johannesburg water has acquired from The Bu supplier which is rent water in this case all right it does sound like uh conversations now lead to the city um to get another view of this conversation and another layer but thank you so much kulet for your time I appreciate it and for just explaining to Residents as well in a way that is easier to understand thank you so much for chatting to us that was the johannesburg's water operations manager Kulu and we are definitely going to be reaching out to the city because this underinvestment is also now adding um you know a further difficulty in the situation because the weather is not going to be letting up you will of course still talk about heat waves and as we hear about a demand um that is now quite um you know unsustainable what does it mean then going forward and what does it mean for their investment of the infrastructure so we'll certainly keep on track um with this particular story and reach out to to the city of Johannesburg that was johannesburg's water operations manager gum"

7weFBvtNmCo,Memorial service for Rhema Bible Church founder Ray McCauley,2024-10-17T16:32:37Z,4821,we take you to another developing story a service to honor the late Rama Bible Church founder Pastor Ray moli will be held at the church tonight and our reporter chela Lewis is standing by chela well a unifier a man of peace and someone who also contributed extensively to the political and social transformation of the country those are some of the words that we've heard from many of the mourners who have been passing their condolences since the news of the passing of Pastor Ray McCauley here at the Rema Bible Church North in Johannesburg in randburg this is where the honoring service or the memorial service will be taking place we're expecting thousands of people to pack the auditorium here you'd recall I did mention in my previous Crossing that uh he went on to found one of the most influential churches in southern Africa having founded this one in 1979 however having the first service here in 16th of June 1985 that's when the first opening service was held uh relating to the Rema Bible Church and so much has been said about this man who preached from the pulpit but also once he left the pulpit he was already also very interested you know in the future of South Africa how the church would be able to contribute to whatever was taking place in South Africa we've previously heard how we'd urge members of the con congregation to become involved if there've been floods in South Africa how the church would be able to become involved and assist those who have been left destitute when there was any tragedy that had befallen the country always urged the church to get involved in that many had been inspired by uh Pastor Ray McCauley uh from the pulpit right here behind me but also outside of this church let's chat a bit more about that now on those that got to know this man that contributed so much I want to speak first of all to Pastor lingal CH from the international Federation of Christian churches as well as Reverend Matula as well from the International Federation of Christian churches um past chwen what do we take from this great man and the mark that he has left certainly had a lot of influence not only in South Africa but internationally as well chriselda thank you very much uh a lot we can take from this man as stal of the faith the legend of the Gospel but one thing that stands out for me or stood out for me in his legacy was his love for people generally he had a message of social relevance a church beyond the walls he believed that the church must not just stick inside the church walls he believed in the impact of the church the message of the church being carried practically uh you know in the social space he believed in Social relevance one of his great messages was that uh the this this mystery of the Gospel is not a secret to be kept we've got to go public with this so Pastor Ray moli is a great model of this in fact one of the slogans that remained and resounded uh about the church for the longest time was more than a church he believed in a church that is strong and socially relevant and uh his love for the people his love for the country he believed in the impact of the church on the destitute he believed in the impact on the poor those you know who who who do not have who are are are not as blessed as we are so he he he preached a a practical gospel uh he preached a gospel that is not just about going to heaven uh you know the message that we cannot just be so Heavenly bound and Earthly useless so I believe it's a great legacy that we can take from Pastor Ray and carry forward Reverend Matula let me bring you in you know um I did say uh in my intro that um he was very passionate about South Africa and its people uh Whenever there had been tragedy when Whenever there had been floods things outside the church he felt that the church needed to become involved there were Outreach programs to assist those who've been left destitute as well as assist the poor I mean this is something that the church uh should hold in high regard definitely that is what Christ is expecting us to do I mean he says I was in prison you did not visit me I was hungry you did not feed me you know I was naked you did not clothe me Pastor Ray moli did exactly that he realized that it's not enough just to preach Christ you know good messages people they are in need people are suffering and he demonstrated that by doing those type of things going out there and show the love of Jesus practically not just in preaching and for that that is why we are here to celebrate him but I also want to mention that this was a brave man this was a man who was not scared to confront the issues in the country when things were going wrong he would stand in public and confront the issues that were troubling our nation that is why you'll see him taking photos with your late Nelson Mandela former president almost all the presidents you know after our our independence because he has been fighting to say all people are equal both black and white so that is why we are here to celebrate him Reverend Pastor thank you very much indeed for your time we really do uh appreciate it here on the sabc news channel and that's certainly what we've heard you know over the past couple of days is that uh you know he was not afraid in fact that's why you would have seen over the past few days a number of political parties leaders of political parties who've uh come to share uh and uh you know send their condolences uh to the church as well as on the passing of Pastor Ray McCauley and those sentiments are certainly what's going to be shared from the podium right behind me the pulpit where he preached from but not only

official funeral Category 2 now this follows hen Premier Baza lisi's request that the president honor the life of the pioneering religious leader social reformer and founder of ARA Bible Church the funeral will be held on Saturday well the memorial service will meanwhile start at 7:00 tonight at RMA Bible Church in randburg Pastor mccy established the church in the late 1970s spreading the gospel of racial integration even at the height of apartate mcau passed away at his home last week at the age of 75 at the time of his death mccol had stepped down from his duties he leaves behind a church which today has about 45,000 members well for more on the memorial service we're now joined by a reporter our senior reporter that is csala Lewis good afternoon to you uh csala of course uh we have no doubt that this is going to be just one of those very packed Services considering the Legacy that Ray McAuley leaves behind well certainly onati and it uh certainly does not come as a surprise that uh the honoring service or the memorial service for the late Pastor RMA is taking place here at the Rema Bible Church North in in randburg in Johannesburg this is the church that he founded back in 1979 and uh without a doubt from what we've heard and what many would attest to it certainly has become uh one of the most influential churches in southern Africa we've heard a number of tributes that have been pouring in since uh the announcement of his passing but onati what we've certainly heard mostly is about the indelible Mark or the role that Pastor Ray McCauley had played insignificant dialogue that saw a peaceful and smooth transition of South Africa into democracy in 1994 he has been described as a man of peace and if we look back to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission you would recall at the time he had been the president of one of the federations of International Christian churches and uh at the time he spoke about or even urged white South Africans at the time uh you know to admit that they'd been manipulated by the apartate government he's been described of course you know as a man of peace and unti I must tell you I'm actually a congregant at this church and one of the the services that I attended uh was just shortly before the elections the last elections here in South Africa and I recall him praying for a peaceful election for the country urging the congregation to also pray with him for peace ahead of the election so many have said this is a man that was concerned and wanted to see South Africa in a good space always looking to where he could contribute even uh you know away from the pulpit to ensuring that South Africa was moving in the right direction many have also described him as a mentor there are many young pastors at this church you know have come through the the the the doors of the Rema Bible Church North here in brandberg in Johannesburg that can attest to the mentorship of the late Pastor Ray McCauley and the indelible Mark that he has made towards the contribution of seeing young people also progress and on the right direction as well I don't want to waste much time I want to bring in uh one of the pastors here at this church pastor Wayne Uh chauna who will talk to us you've had a very long week pastor Wayne and I can only but imagine uh you know it all culminating to this moment honoring Pastor Ry moli for the contribution that he's made standing right at that Pulpit as well as the contribution that he made away from it yeah uh this is definitely the combination of um I think it's a weighty ex expectation you which is also God's invitation so it has been hard and very challenging to actually put up a um uh a service like like we have tonight to get some of these friends from overseas from across Africa to be here but um by God's grace we've been we've managed to actually put everything together and uh we just waiting to see what God is going to do tonight T night um we've we've we've we've managed to actually get his friends from childhood you know fellow pastors people that ran the rest with him uh the family is all here we get to see all the Mes in one place in a very very long time so we all wait now to see what's going to happen in the service but I can tell you right now it's it's the conversion of this the secular and the sacred coming together and I think that's what the house of God needs to look like and much has been said over the past week about his legacy uh and the contribution that he has made you know far and wide I recall um just before the elections uh you know he was here and he spoke about I think it was Premier paza lufi who was also in attendance and he spoke about you know South Africa uh having to continue on a certain path of Peace how we need to pray for our country he was concerned about the church he was concerned about South Africa he was concerned about South Africa's people let's talk about that Legacy uh and I guess that baon is now handed over to uh you know uh to Josh as well as the congregation and to yourselves as well yeah I know pastor always believed that as a nation we we need to have common fronts where we agree on certain things Unity peace freedom um freedom of speech freedom to worship and those are the things I did never compromise on so when it came to elections he made sure that we as congregation we must not forget that we are part of society we are part of the nation it is our duty as as Citizens to go and vote so he was very vocal about that but he also emphasized on the fact that when we go to vote we need to understand that there are other people who got different opinions in terms of their choices on who they vote for we need to respect that and that uh go and cast your vote that's your your vote it's yours but also respect other people let's do that in a peaceful manner he was a man that always was in touch with what's happening in the country wherever there's a disaster he was the first one to say guys what are we doing about this thing can we send Aid can we send help do we need to send buses do we need to erect like temporary shelter for these people he he was very much in touch with what is happening in our nation you know and I mean for you I mean I recall on that day you know obviously he had become quite frail and uh that service was actually very short I'd attended with my family and you helped him on the stage that day what lessons do you as young pastors take from this giant of a man um in terms of steering the the church going forward and also making sure that you know the messages that he held true to is what would Echo for generations to come as this church stands as a child an African Child we all know that uh when our parents get older it's our mandate it's our duty to make sure we are there to help and finish strong and that was the case with Pastor Ray that we knew we made a promise to him that we're going to help him to finish strong so for as long as he was able to speak and be able to preach we were going to do everything and anything to make sure that he's able to preach so that he can finish strong that was his desire to make sure that he goes out with a bang and he did 3 weeks ago he preached one of the most profound messages you ever hear him preach and he was actually saying goodbye to us we just didn't understand it at that moment but in in hindsight we could see that he was actually saying goodbye to the congregation and to all of us I think for me personally I have learned so many things from Pastor Ray you know humility generosity but most important to to always recognize and see people in the corridors that was one thing that Pastor would never walk in a corridor in a passage at the mall or in church and he meets people he always acknowledges people he always was intact in touch with people and uh he did that with everybody you know not only staff or someone who's a pastor but everybody so there's so many things that we have learned from him and we still going to continue to learn from him because history has got a lot of material that we can always go back and study the man that we was once Among Us here yeah and that last service was uh a re the part that said as you leave God goes with you he doesn't stay in the auditorium yes right that was the one right yes that's that's that's the one I mean how do you then have how do we carry this Legacy what would we say then needs to be done to ensure that this Legacy um you know continues to stand and we always remember Pastor Ray for the giant that he was yeah I think one of his last words was The Best Is Yet To Come and when it comes to the Legacy Pasto wants us to exceed what he has done he doesn't want us to maintain what we have here he wants us to to do more than what he had done I think I've I've always said that Legacy is leing a place better than you found it but in the case of Pastor Ray he didn't find anything he had to start everything from scratch corre but he has left what you see here and some stuff that you you cannot see we need to make sure that we we leave this place when it's our time better than we found it that's number one number two is legacy is who you leave behind it's so evident today and you're going to see as people flock in that there are so many people that Pasar has left behind to carry his you know his legacy forward and lastly Legacy is planting a tree fully knowing that you may not be able to live under its shed some of the things that we experienc today and what we're going to experience in the days to come months and years to come Pon be able to witness or be part of that but that is Legacy he he put himself out there and made sure that he started what we see today to make sure that we have a place you know to sit under the shade so that's going to go on and we're going to make sure that we don't we don't let the man of God down but continue pick up the B and and move forward look after our community you know get people to worship you know and just be out there for those who are in need you know yeah Pastor way thank you very much indeed I'm looking forward to the next Sunday Night Live it's always my favorite thank you very much indeed pastor Wayne chauna who is of course one of the pastors here at uh the Rema Bible Church North in uh Johannesburg that's in randburg of course this

lVI6Z4xbFZ0,President Ramaphosa answers questions in Parliament,2024-10-17T14:18:10Z,29766,"e e e moment of Silent prayer and meditation may we be seated MERS honorable members spe what's happening honorable members my apologies we just had to address the issue of communications it had just uh had a glitch or a little problem I'd like to welcome you back to the house after we have been on our constituency work I had a welcome party here even though bab is not here who has invited us but this is not a of is the cting of the house as members know that we had promised through the wher that we will try and do what is possible to make sure that we can come together and have a full sitting as the house Public Works had indicated to the whery that they are busy with the bringing of the Dome and whatever that needed to be fixed finally the minister and his team will ensure that by January next year the Dome will be here fully fledged and will allow us to continue the work as this house as our Parliament is being rebuilt honorable members before us we proceed with today's business I wish to announce that the vacancy which occurred in the National Assembly owing to the loss of membership by Mr Aros in terms of section 47 uh subsection 3C of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 has been filled by the nomination of Miss F Miko with effect from 7 October 2024 the member has made a subscribe and subscribed to the oath with the speaker and I would like to welcome Migo as the member of the National Assembly thank you very much she seated there towards the back thank you you may be seated man today today as you know is the questions to the president and this is the only item on our order paper there are supplementary questions on each question parties have given an indication of which questions their members wish to pose as supplementary questions adequate notice was given to parties for this purpose the members who will post supplementary questions will be recognized by the presiding officer in allocating opportunities for supplementary question the principle of fairness among others has been applied when all the supplementary questions have been answered by the president we will proceed to the next question on the question paper the first question has been asked by The Honorable s mahuma pilo the question is about the need for the edge and reform of the United Nations security Council to include African representation and the measures to ensure that this reform is Advanced urgently I'll now invite honorable the president to the podium to answer to the question honorable president honorable speaker honorable members the reform of the UN Security Council is vital to Global efforts to advance peace and stability in the world South Africa participates in the United Nations General assemblies intergovernmental negotiations on the security Council it does so both in its capacity as a sovereign member State and as a member of the Africa group South Africa maintains that the international political and economic system remains unequal and unjust it reflects the world as it was more than 70 years ago not as it is today we therefore continue to call for the Urgent reform of the security Council based on the African common position this position which is articulated in the eulin consensus calls for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council for Africa it calls for the abolishment of the veto right and prerogative that currently is held by five members but it also says that for as long as the veto exists it is a privilege and a prerogative which should be extended to all new permanent members as well in its current configuration the UN Security Council has failed in the execution of its Charter mandate because of narrow national interests that are pursued and the Quest for further geopolitical influence it has not been able in recent years to prevent or to resolve several damaging conflicts around the world this is evident in conflicts currently underway in the Middle East in the Sudan in the East part of the DRC and between Russia and Ukraine the shortcomings of the UN Security Council have had a disast disastrous impact on the African continent and the global South which in many ways often experiences the social and economic effects of conflicts that are taking place elsewhere geopolitical realities have changed since the UN was established today African member states make up a quarter of the 18 93 rather states that are are members of the United Nations yet not a single African country has a permanent seat at the table where decisions on the maintenance of International Peace and security are made this is a particular concern when many of the issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council relat to matters on the African continent South Africa is a strong advocate for a text based negotiations in the intergovernmental negotiations during the 79th session of the UN General Assembly there was an an acknowledgement by some of the permanent five Security Council Members that Africa should indeed be granted two permanent seats however there is no clarity as to the issue of the veto it is significant that there is also a recognition by some permanent members that text based negotiations are necessary to move the reform debate forward South Africa was amongst those UN member states that successfully advocated for the Recently adopted PCT for the future to commit to urgent ently reform the security Council South Africa will remain an Ardent voice for the Urgent reform of the UN Security Council and the need to correct the historical injustices committed against our beloved continent I thank you thank you Mr President the followup question will be supplementary question will be taken by Mr Ms mu uh thank you uh Madame speaker uh considering South Africa's upcoming G20 presidency what specific strategies will can you come closer to the mic please considering South Africa's upcoming G20 presidency what specific strategies will our Administration Implement to prioritize the reform of global governance institution ensuring they are more representative and inclusive of Africa in particular in the global sou in general thank you Mr President thank you honorable speaker we as the incoming president of the G20 have selected a theme that talks to solidarity equality and sustainable development embedded in this theme is really the equal treatment of all nations in the world and particularly the equal treatment for our continent which has for the longest time been excluded from key positions where decisions affecting the world are made so we will be arguing and putting forward very strong views which hopefully will be adopted in the Declaration that we will put forward to the G20 that the reform of the UN Security Council and indeed various other Global institutions should take into account the views of those countries that have been excluded for the longest time in participating meaningfully in such structures so our G20 process will be aimed at promoting the interests of our continent as well as the global South we see this G20 which will be held for the very first time in Africa as a great platform for us as South Africa to promote the interests of our continent and the global South as well so the issue of representativity in global institutions is going to be quite prominent we rather please Madame speaker that what we've been advocating for years now in various platforms around the world is beginning to gain traction and we are hoping that with a further push at forthcoming events or Summits such as the one that we will be going to next week in uh Russia Russia the bricks Summit followed by the G20 in Brazil we will advance the argument for the representation of those countries that have been excluded so the G20 for us is going to be a key moment and it's a moment that we would like to mobilize our nation around so that our nation all formations in our nation should see the G20 as being a national project having National interest objectives so that we are able to advance indeed the interest of our continent and the global South thank you Madame speaker thank you honorable elel po thanks speaker Mr President the da acknowledges the importance of Africa securing permanent rep representation on the UN Security Council as the continent of the future however the recent Democratic backslide across several African countries is deeply concerning this includes rigged elections in Zimbabwe and the continued Detention of pro-democracy activists in countries like Tanzania Zimbabwe and Angola many governments on our continent seem indifferent to Human Rights and the principles of the UN Charter so should we achieve un reform will South Africa support the candidacy of countries simply because they are African or will their adherence to the principles of Human Rights and democracy be a prerequisite for South Africa's support Mr President our support for Africa's representation on the UN Security Council and indeed on many other structures that involve Global governance is obviously based on the principles that have been adopted by the UN itself as well as the principles that have been adopted by the African Union as well as sadic where our country resides or is located so these three organizations including a few others that we are members of have adopted principles that speaks to governance human rights and we also base our approach on our own Constitution that continues to guide us in terms of what we do globally to promote a better world and a better Africa so our participation and our argument for Africa to be included clearly is going to be in accordance with those principles and in the end it is the African Union that is going to take the decision as set out in the aini consensus on which countries should be represented on the UN Security Council the Asun consensus was very clear that at the very least we want two representatives and if we get more of course we will be very pleased but the decision is not going to be taken by South Africa nor will it be taken by a single particular country it will be taken by the African Union and it will be taken on the basis of representativity as well as on the basis of capacity and that is what the asini consensus put forward so be rest assured that our position is going to be based on what the United the African Union decides as you may well know we are not the only country that is represented on the African Union we are just but one of the many countries on our continent much as our voice is quite vocal so are many other Count's vocal voices vocal as well because we are part of a collective we don't act alone thank you honorable speaker thank you honorable VG ready thank you speaker I find it very hard and I need you to help me here in believing anything this President says and I'm not the only one uh I'm supported by the major it of South Africans as well as members of his own party who are deserting thec at phenomenal numbers while his call for the Urgent reform of the UN SEC Security Council may sound bold on the international stage we must ask ourselves how can we trust these promises on this matter when here at home objective evidence shows that he's consistently failed to deliver on promises to improve the lives of the overwhelming black majority under his leadership the government has defied the progressive posture of his own Alliance by accommodating International mon monetary fund and World Bank policies that impose neoliberal austerity on South Africa ensuring that Western Capital dominates economic landscape so the question is what is his response now that the has unveiled him honorable president honorable members can you please not debate across the floor president will answer the question order allow the president to make his remark whether he answers how he answers the president has the right to respond to the member Mr President honorable speaker I am struggling in my head quite honestly to find a thread that from The Honorable members um articulation what the question was and I heard him talk about failure to deliver members of my party leaving my party the IMF and the World Bank neoliberal uh so to be quite honest I would like I would have liked to answer a clear question and I'm struggling quite frankly thank you H honorable NLS nanga honorable nanga can we move to the second question number eight asked by Reverend misher on honorable Reverend misher the question is about the government's position on the United Nations declaration known as the pack for the future and what this p means for the Republic honorable the president Madame speaker the main focus of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly was the summit of the future and its key outcome document the PCT for the future the PCT in itself seeks to forge a new Global consensus for the global Community to protect the needs and interests of present and future generations and the PCT covers a number of areas critical to the progress of humanity before I go on it was a real honor and a pleasure for us as South Africa to participate in this debate a debate and a process that was aely led by Namibia and Germany it was a proud moment to see a sister country on our continent and in our region having led a process of this nature that has resulted in a GL Global agreement that has brought about a number of individuals that included heads of state and government observers non-governmental organizations un system organizations civil society and a number of other organizations think tanks and many others and this was for a broader push to increase the engagement of diverse actors and the formal Summit itself was preceded by another process which Namibia and Germany LED in which included we were told up to 7,000 individuals representing all segments of society so the summit process and the PCT have been deep have deeply en enriched were deeply enriched by contributions of millions of voices and thousands of stakeholders from around the world we were proud yes to work alongside Namibia and our representatives were closely involved in the whole process and world leaders representing many countries adopted the PCT for the future and the PCT itself is a wide ranging International agreement that has been in the making for many years covering entirely new areas as well as issues on which agreement has not been possible over many decades and the document aims above all to ensure that International institutions can deliver in the face of what the world is going through right now now as as the Secretary General said which was observed by honorable Reverend Misha he said we cannot create a future fit for our grandchildren with a system built by our grandparents that in many ways encapsulates the key objective of the PCT of the future and the PCT covers a broad range of issues as I said including peace and security sustainable development climate change and the new area which was debated and agreed upon after long discussions was the digit digital Corporation human rights gender Youth and the F and future generations and all these matters then culminated in this P of the future for us as South Africa this spoke to precisely what we stand for as clearly articulated in our constitution also articulated in the freedom Charter a base document that is widely supported also in our country and by a number of political parties that are represented in this Parliament on sustainable development climate change and financing for development one could say that the entire PCT is designed in a way to speed up the process of implementation of the sdgs the sustainable development goals there was consensus on a detailed agreement ever at the UN on the need to reform the International Financial architecture so that it can better represent and serve developing countries particular countries in the global South including giving developing countries or economy countries as I called them a greater say in how decisions are taken at International financial institutions level it also included mobilizing more financial financing rather and multilateral development Banks to help developing economic countries more and to meet their own development needs and reviewing the sovereign debt architecture and all these matters we found as very important for the future but also focusing on future Generations the digital cooperation pact is a comprehensive Global framework for digital cooporation and at the heart of the compact is a commitment to to design to use and govern technology and to make sure that technology works for all and on human rights and gender the PCT aims to strengthen our work on human rights gender equality as well as the empowerment of women for South Africa the PCT for the future reflects many of the key elements of our International agenda the effective implementation of the actions contained in the pact for the future will make a significant contribution to building a better world and a better Africa Madame speaker I thank you thank you president Reverend krj misser um thank you speaker thank you Mr President for your reply the acdp believes that Godly values such as love respect and care for others that our grandparents instilled in US helped to build a solid foundation for our children and grandchildren these are some of the values that have kept African families and cultures intact the P for the future is controversial in that it lays the foundation for the un's new Global Order that will see the transfer of power from Sovereign Nations to the un while some may consider the P for the future a progressive step towards Global cooperation it presents certain dangers and disadvantages that will need careful consideration of significant risk is the potential erosion of our national sovereignity noting all the positiv you stated Mr President my question is whether you can assure this house and all consent s africant that you will not support or allow the sovereignity of South Africa to be eroded when the un's PCT for the future is implemented I thank you thank you Mr President thank you honorable uh speaker when we participated in the various discussions that have been taking place through a number of formations both on our own continent and in various other organizations ations in the world we were as a country always aware that we've got to promote our own National interest interests that are clearly encapsulated in our Constitution and interests that are also rep clearly well articulated in our Charter uh at the Au level and in doing so we joined many others many other countries in the world and honorable Reverend misher will have listened carefully hope when I described the process that has led to the adoption of this P because it was thoroughly debated over a number of years involving at the very last moment seven more than 7,000 individuals and many many countries that finally adopted this Charter and I would never believe that any of our the countries that participated would have wanted in the end to erode their own sovereignty they would instead have wanted to strengthen the United Nations because through the United Nations we are stronger through the United Nations we able to strengthen our own sovereignty I've never seen the United Nations eroding a country's sovereignty as the United Nations through the charter that was adopted aims to promote all what I would say is good that every country would want to see promoted so we we participated with a great deal of confidence knowing that in the debates in the exchanges we are not undermining what we stand for and what our constitution sets out thank you honorable speaker thank you president honorable Masina the PCT for the future articulates a number of aspiration as observed by the UN please be closer to the mic order honorable members allow the member to express himself honorable Masina bring the mic closer to you the peg for the future articulates a number of aspiration as observed by the UN Secretary General president can you kindly share with sou Africa what did South Africa posit on the following aspect firstly on the need for the reform of the International Financial architecture so that it can better serve developing countries as well as on the reviewing of the sovereign debt H architector to ensure that developing countries can borrow sustainably to invest in the future of their country I thank you president Mr President honorable speaker Yes we made our positions very clear when it comes to not only the reform of the United Nations security Council but also the reform of of the financial institutions the financial architecture the various International organizations such as the IMF the World Bank and a number of others that operate at a global level we argued and continue to argue that Africa needs to be well represented in such institutions that take decisions that are of Global impact and we have been clear about what we've been putting forward and honorable member Masina might recall that during covid the issue of the representation of our continent on these institutions as well as the issue of The Sovereign death came up very strongly we were then the chair of the Au and we led the process of arguing for debt forgiveness for those countries particularly in the global South that are in deep debt debt stall or debt stoage of paying interest that uh that should happen and uh that there should also be debt canellation and debt restructuring so we LED that process and even touched on important issues which are dealt with uh at the IMF and the World Bank uh on issues like the srds uh which have been made available uh in large measure to your more developed economy countries and and that those should also be made available to the African continent or the global South we did successfully get that process to succeed to some extent but feel that it has not succeeded enough so honorable Masina we continue to argue for debt forgiveness we argue for that canellation because a number of countries on our continent are heavily Laden with debt and many of them are having to spend quite a lot of their own resources on security M matters on disasters that befall their own countries due to climate change and we argue that the world financial institutions should come to the aid and assistance of such countries but more particularly we want to be at the table where all these matters are discussed so we continue to advocate for fairness for equality and as you will have heard in the theme for our chairpersonship or presidency of the G20 we are frontloading the issue of solidarity that there does need to be solidarity and the solidarity that we talk about must be all encompassing it must also involve issues such as sovereign debt treatment equality which is part of our theme must lead to equality of treatment we must also as the African continent be represented in all those organizations in the Global Financial architecture that take decisions that affect many nations so our campaign uh is not going to stall in fact it is going to gain momentum as we now get in November to be given the seat to be president of the G20 and we have the support of many countries on our continent and in the global South to continue arguing for these positions so we will not Tire we will continue to articulate these positions thank you Madame speaker thank you m Mr President honorable Mala thank you very much uh comate president uh firstly I want to thank you for according comrade ditto official feneral because when it comes to us that site we always struggle I still struggle with the fact that Peter maaba was never accorded a state funeral and I'm happy that you gave it to comrade Tito welld deserving Category 2 state federal President we must appreciate the role that you have played when it comes to International court of justice and the fact that South Africa mobilized the International Community in support of the Palestinian question we appreciate that the PCT for the future has got Progressive resolutions in relation to Palestine and this parliament in line with P of the future took a resolution that we must lose the Israeli Embassy and cut all diplomatic ties with Israel till to date you are so reluctant to implement that decision and the one behind you in the name of the speaker can also explain as to why is that resolution of parliament which was taken by the majority of our people here in Parliament that we must cut the Diplomatic ties with Israel and close the Embassy of Israel because we cannot share a territory with murderers with rapist and people who kidnapped women and kill children and want to erode the Palestinian Nation yes so I'm asking Mr President as to what is your reluctance because that resolution was taken when you the president of South Africa committed to the people of Palestine yes you must take an practical action like Brazil did Brazil said the ambassador of Brazil must be withdrawn completely isra your why are you scared to withdraw our Embassy and close the Israel Embassy in South Africa Mr President honorable honorable Masina you don't have to read for that honorable Mala you can take those matters outside they are not for the house honorable president thank you honorable speaker honorable are reluctant uh and uh cardish and all that that is not so the executive has noted fully noted what the National Assembly took a resolution on and we have said as we've been asked that this matter is being considered and we also considering the various broad issues around it our support for the cause of the Palestinians is irrevocable and we have articulated that here from time to time and the various other aspects of putting pressure on Israel to do what is right by and for the Palestinians are matters that are being considered and a number of proposals have been put forward so be rest assured honorable malma that these are matters that the executive is Con considering now of course being the who you are impatient you want everything to be done yesterday I know that but it is a matter that is being considered in a very active Manner and in due course we will be able to articulate precisely what the executives response is to the resolution that was taken by the National Assembly thank you thank you honorable malma thank you very much uh honorable president I will now ask honorable poell to ask a supplementary question thank you speaker Mr President the paack for the future aims to accelerate progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030 like many nations South Africa is behind on its targets the Democratic Alliance is economic Justice policy offers a Daya driven approach to fost tracking these goals by shifting away from race-based Economic Policy instead it proposes prioritizing companies that make the greatest socioeconomic input as measured by the SGS when competing at equal levels of price and functionality would the executive be open to considering this evidence-based proposal as a pathway towards meeting our SG commitments even if it involves rethinking narrow race-based empowerment policies Mr President honorable speaker I would like to believe that the honorable member is clearly aware of what our constitution says about us as a nation having to redress the imbalances the inequalities of the past that is clearly articulated in our Constitution and even the preamble to our constitution speaks to that now honorable member ascribes what one would say a is redressing the imbalances of the past to being race based empowerment policies I would say with the greatest respect when you redress the imbalances of the past and deal with the ugly past that this country was subjected to you have to take demonstrable actions and our constitution says some of those must be legislative clearly set out in our Constitution that we've got to take legislative actions and a whole number of other means and initiatives to ensure that the ugly past that we have come from becomes a sh shadow of our past and through that yes there's got to be empowerment and that empowerment is not only based on the color of people's skins it is also based on things such as regionality where people have originated from it is also based on gender the women of our country were forever suppressed and they lived under poverty and inequality and I then wonder whether by just Contin continuing as normal as it was done in the past whether we would ever be able to uplift the women of our country the young people of our country people who live in rural areas and indeed the black people of our country it has become globally well accepted that you've got to take active steps to deal with a past that holds us back from moving forward to the Future and this is a precept that is clearly articulated in our constitution I would not know how One deals with it and the difference with what we doing now is what they did in the past in the past those who ruled this country were blatant racists they were unashamed they were Unapologetic they just on a race basis just suppressed the majority and Advan the interests of a minority in this country we are advancing the interest of all and I think I think it is disingenous it really is disingenous to then say as we advance the interests of all our people from a regional point of view gender point of view uh youth point of view and yes National Group point of view that that in itself works against the development and the attainment of our sustainable development goals I can say without any equivocation we will not depart from the path that we have embarked upon for empowerment and transformation that is something that I will put up here clearly because it is in our constitution thank you honorable speaker thank you Mr President we now move to the third question question number nine which has been asked by honorable G bonbar the question is about what steps the president intends taking to ensure that members of his cabinet act in accordance with the government's commitment to build a capable and ethical state in the light of the allegations against the Minister of Justice and constitutional development honorable the president the executive members ethics Act of 1998 provides a legislative basis for the promotion of ethical conduct by all members of the executive the law makes provision for a code of ethics that prescribes standards and rules in support of all open Democratic and accountable government the executive ethics code which was prated on 28th July 2000 says that members must to the satisfaction of the president or Premier perform their duties and exercise their powers D diligently and honestly it requires that they act in all respects in a manner that is consistent with the Integrity of their office among other things the code says that members may not use their position to enrich themselves or improperly benefit any other person they may not expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and their private interests to promote transparency as well as accountability every member must disclose to the Secretary of the cabinet on an annual basis their financial interests and those of their spouses permanent companions or dependent children to provide an additional layer of assurance the ACT requires the public protector to be in a position to investigate any alleged breach of the code of ethics on receipt of a complaint by the president or a member of parliament this establishes what I would call a robust mechanism for ensuring that members of the executive adhere to the code and that they generally uphold ethical standards that are required or expected of the them I've have made it clear to the members of the executive that I appointed on 30th July 2024 that they are expected to meet the standards established by the executive ethics code and to uphold the oath that we all took and that they should abide by the oath and this is what we expect of every member of the executive I thank you honorable speaker thank you Mr President supplementary question come from Advocate G BRB thank you honorable speaker and uh good afternoon Mr President if you can please bring the mic closer to you given that this matter raises serious questions about the Integrity of The Minister's Financial dealings honorable member we cannot hear you may I sit down we can hear you now okay given that this matter raises serious questions about the Integrity of The Minister's Financial dealings and the glaring conflict of interest on the part of the minister with the startling contradictions in the dodgy loan agreement illustrated by the fact that the financial sector conduct Authority yesterday debarred and fined The Minister's finan finial advisor for his part in the VBS debacco will the president remove the minister and make the findings of this review public to uphold transparency and accountability in government I thank you Mr President thank you honorable speaker I did say and with the active participation of the minister and I said that I've requested the minister to submit met to me a report on exactly what has happened that document report has been submitted together with various annexures and that is a matter that I'm giving consideration to thank you honorable speaker thank you honorable uh F royan Mr President as MK party we take it as a common cause that in order for you to objectively handle the matter concerning Minister Similan you will effectively require that law enforcement agencies should act in consistent and impartial manner in the interpretation and application of the law but we all know reality dictates otherwise for for example the NP itself as our Prosecuting Authority is it's it's it's not without its own blemishes the center for development Enterprise just Rec on its report on the 1st of this month lamented what they characterize as dismal record where when it comes to initiating prosecutions and securing convictions the center says there are rogue elements and obstructiveness in NPA they even recommend that honorable member if you can summarize your time is up the qu the straightforward question Mr President is that can the president take this house into confidence on how your government of The Da Le Coalition will ensure that the state your time is up are not used for spirous reasons I thank you thank you honorable president thank you honorable speaker I thought I heard the member say the government of The Da Le something now what we have is a government of national unity in which all our honorable members your answer I'm sure you would want here honorable president it looks like I've pressed a very painful button now what we have is a government of national unity in which 10 political parties that are represented here participate as well as some others participate in a parliament of national Unity now I can assure The Honorable member that there is just no way on a point of order speaker on a point of order yes thank you very much honorable member sorry I didn't see you honor I think the president is deliberately misleading the house there's no parliament of national Unity there's no such a thing thank you honorable member Mr President thank you honorable speaker there are parties that are not represented in the government of national Unity that are working together with those parties that are part of the government of national unity and however one describes them is obviously open for discussion or debate what I wanted to assure The Honorable member on is that there is just no intention no action whatsoever that will be taken in the executive that I lead to utilize State institutions against members or anyone those institutions are institutions that we hold in high regard the highest regard and they've been granted the independence by our Constitution and we let them do their work without any fear favor or any Prejudice I had occasion to meet with a number of these institutions together with a number of members of the executive to deal primarily with u their logistical issues their organizational matters but I took time to thank them for the work they do but also gave them the full assurance that we respect their independence and we want to urge them and strengthen them in their resolve to be independent to act without any favor and without any Prejudice that I repeated adium to them and it is out of adhering to the precepts of our Constitution that we need to do that and we will honorable member continue to do precisely that and not seek to use any of the arms of the state to take actions against any citizen in South Africa and those institutions must act independently on their own to do their work whether it's investigative whether it's prosecutorial and whether they have to do anything that will advance the interests of the people of South Africa thank you honorable chairperson thank you honorable president honorable NZ balesi thank you honorable speaker honorable president since the conclusion of the commission of inquiry into State capture there has been little to deter the ongoing association between corruption and public office a key reason for this is sadly the failure to prosecute many of those implicated as the first citizen of the country it is crucial that you set a strong precedent by unequivocally condemning unethical leadership as it robs our people of the opportunity to live in a corruption free South Africa can The Honorable president as head of the cabinet and state reassured the nation by explaining how he has addressed this issue in a way that will prevent similar incidents in a in the future I thank you honorable speaker honorable president honorable speaker I have said repeatedly that one of the objectives that we have embarked upon to deal firmly with the period that we went through of State capture is to ensure that the institutions are strengthened once again many of our institutions had become weak and they had been weakened deliberately and we have sought and continue to do so to strengthen them by ensuring that they have the independence reassuring them for that matter and that they should act in accordance with the law and they should act without favor or Prejudice as I was saying earlier those those who have been referred to in various reports especially the report on state capture will in the end have to be dealt with by the various institutions whose job and whose function is to either investigate these matters or to act upon them the day the president gets involved in identifying certain people to be investigated to be prosecuted and to be judged as I've often said even in the previous Parliament that that is the day we have to run for the hills the function of the president is amongst other things to strengthen those institutions so that they do do their work independently and this honorable members I will continue repeating not withstanding various suspicions that may fly around suspicions that may even suggest that the president did this the deputy President also did this and both of us as we sit at the head of the Executive will never be involved in such activities we will allow the institutions of our nation to do their work and to give the Assurance once again whatever name has been mentioned in the state capture commission report will be dealt with will be looked at by those institutions whose job is to do precisely that and by strengthening those institutions and by establishing others that can strengthen our democracy I do believe that it puts South Africa on a much stronger and firmer footing where the rule of law our democracy becomes stronger and not susceptible to the whims of any individual who may want to take action against certain people that he may like or may not like so that is precisely where we stand as an executive and that's precisely where I also stand firmly as the President of the Republic thank you honorable speaker thank you president honorable TK s l thank you uh Madame speaker good afternoon Mr President we are considered honorable and as such need to be guided by ethics and operate way above the requirements of law Guided by our responsibilities and not our rights what will it take for the president to allow the Minister of Justice a leave of absence to clear the cloud that surrounds her and give the president as much time to consider the matter whilst preserving the sanctity of the office of the min Minister of Justice to give those of us aw awaiting Justice reason to have Hope and Faith in the justice system and that the Dignity of the Justice Minister be preserved honorable president thank you honorable speaker honorable Dr leape it will take give giving the president the time and opportunity to consider this matter so that finality can then be reached and so therefore honorable llap that's precisely what one has been saying that and I may have been thought to be saying it glibly when I said I need time and space to be able to do so and I'd like to repeat that yes this matter is under consideration thank you very much thank you President we now move to the fourth question asked by honorable molder the question is considering the positive outcomes of the first 100 days of the government of national Unity is it the present intention to extend the principle of gnu to all spheres of government honorable president honorable speaker in its first 100 days the government of national Unity has indeed proven its value and its worth to the country and its people the gnu as we've come to call it has effectively managed what I would call a smooth transition from the sixth to the 7th Democratic Administration it it has ensured stability and continuity it has promoted inclusivity importantly it has brought together a broad spectrum of political parties to work together to advanc Shared principles and also to pursue a common program of action to address the challenges that confront our nation it is significant honorable speaker that the gnu has not only agreed on the priority actions outlined in the opening of a parliament address on the 18th of July but has already made progress in undertaking a number of these actions building on the work of the previous administration the gnu has worked with social partners to stabilize the country in a number of ways when it comes for instance to one of our recurring Challenge and problem which was electricity Supply and also to improve the performance of our Logistics and our ports it has introduced a number of other initiatives such as new Visa regulations to attract skills to our country but more importantly it has generated a lot of interest in our country when it comes to investment and tourism this morning I spent time with key players in the auto sector the auto sector contributes about 5.3% to our GDP and employs close to half a million people in its own uh manufacturing base of cars and trucks buses right down to components and nearly everyone who spoke at that occasion which was led by Minister PX STA and the Mec for uh transport I think here in the Western Cape everyone spoke very positively about the climate that is prevailing in our country the interest that investors both local and international are having in the future prospects of economic growth in our country and work is underway across government to improve the prospects of inclusive growth to create employment and training opportunities for young people to to improve the quality of health and education and also to tackle crime and Corruption and to provide social support to those South Africans most in need and this is what I think we can say the government of national Unity is yielding the work of the government of national Unity has been positively received by South Africans who are feeling much more confident about the direction that the country is taking now there is also a marked improvement in sentiment amongst investors various actors in a number of sectors of the industry or the economy whether the gnu approach can and should be extended to other spheres of government is Honorable molda a matter that political parties need to discuss amongst them themselves the experience of the government of national Unity has to date been encouraging and also instructive as a country and as political parties we should see what lessons can be drawn and if there are other circumstances in which we can apply precisely the practice or the lessons that we are drawing from the government of national Unity we should all recall that in the end the government of national Unity was not a an instruction from one person it was a coming together of various political parties by themselves to finally agree on the statement of intent and common principles with a view of taking our country forward so I would in the end say today it behoves on various political parties having the will the determination to work together and take whatever sphere of government forward to address the challenges that our country faces I thank you honorable speaker thank you honorable president the first supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable Dr CP Moulder thank you honorable house chair here um thank you Mr President for your comprehensive uh response in your first newsletter from your desk after the formation or your election on the 24th of June you wrote The Following and I quote the success of the gnu will be measured by the extent to which we are prepared to focus not on who will govern but on how we will govern together and as you correctly pointed out since the election and the creation of a government of national Unity the Rand has strengthened with approximately 7% the bond market is up with 11% the J jsse main Bard has gone up with 10% inflation has come down so is interest race the tourism sector has a very strong recovery in the mood in the country has been lifted it is also so that the concept of the government of national Unity has not been extended to the other spheres of government and the question immediately would be if it's successful on the national level why would it not be success uccessful on other levels of government the question I would like to ask is is this something that you would like to see be discussed amongst political parties as a first Point of Departure then in the the new clearing house that has been created within the government of national Unity thank you sir The Honorable president yes thank you uh honorable house chair the answer to your question honorable Moulder is yes the participants from the various 10 parties had a meeting of if you call it the Clearing House some call it the technical committee and but I see it correctly as a clearing uh Forum where matters amongst the 10 political parties are discussed uh they held their first well their second meet well their first meeting really after I convened uh all of them over dinner one some weeks ago and they discussed a variety of issues so put it more in a straightforward manner I would say yes it's a matter that should also be discussed in the Clearing House or in the clearing Forum of the 10 political parties uh it's a matter that we can never say we should run away from the government of national Unity is working at a national level and it is as I was saying in my reply that we should draw lessons for how it is functioning and in the end be able to say other lessons we can draw from this uh experience that we are going through now so as to ensure that we meet the interests of our people because in the end it is the interest of our people that we should focus on and all the those uh positive indicators that you are speaking of have really also been generated by the government of national Unity uh idea and wherever I go internationally including on our own continent people keep saying heads of government ordinary member say keep saying even in the streets of our country I'm stopped as I take my morning walk they keep saying this was a very good development uh for our country and uh and we also took the trouble honorable molder to explain it to the world when we addressed the United Nations General Assembly we explained exactly what had happened in South Africa and the direction that the country has taken and the Secretary General of the United Nations when we met him applauded us and said that you are once again a shining example for how a country and its various role players can be brought together to work together so that is exactly where we are thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president the second supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable Deo thank you house chair honorable President we have noted the positive outcomes of the first 100 days of gnu so in future how is the president going to sustain this working relations in terms of our transformation agenda statement of intent and the political mandates from different political parties thank you The Honorable president thank you honorable house chair I'd like to say that there's really no magic to this the real answer lies in how all the political parties that are part of the government of national Unity are committed to working together but also more importantly committed to finding solutions to the various areas where they may differ and as we have said the government of national Unity is made up of 10 parties that come from completely different in many instances different ideological backgrounds different histories different experiences and composed of people from different backgrounds and different areas in our country and we have said that we will seek to work together and find solutions for whatever Challenge and difficulty that we come across and find compromises and indeed right from the word go what the 10 political parties did was to underpin their own coming together by agreeing that whilst we have for instance different election Manifesto we will try and find what brings us together what is common amongst us but more importantly we will try to determine what is in the interests of the people of South Africa and that is precisely what we believe we should focus on more resul resul resul and in doing so we should then Ensure that we handle areas where we differ head on and be able to discuss them and be able to find Solutions some of us were taught by the great Nelson Mandela that there is no problem without a solution and if we hold on to that that every problem has a solution lying around somewhere and we seek that solution we will be able to find it with a view of moving our country forward thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president the third supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable mikakus thank you honorable house chairperson um Mr President if you acknowledge that the gnu has made wonderful progress then the only explanation for siding with everyone but your gnu Partners in Swani is that you either cannot or will not take a stand against the premier of Kang and lead your own party Mr President which one is it the honorable president all honorable members honorable house chair without being flippant I'm tempted to say what type of a question is that but then again to observe the decorum that I should have here is that in the end as I said earlier the issue of how parties work together really depends on their willingness and determination to embrace one another and find Solutions and to listen to one another and in listening to One Another they should be able to seek Solutions but also in the end it also depends on the chemistry the chemistry amongst the participants themselves and I think we should uh also rely on the key area of the principles that those who are participants uh should adhere here too so I will not specifically refer to any of the areas where parties are seeking to work together be it in hting in kedan in the Western Cape or wherever that should be left to the participants Guided by key principles that they should all adhere to thank you honorable chair thank you honorable president remembers the last supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable my Mane thank you uh uh house chairperson and to the president I think it it is undeniable the fact that we're seeing some green shoots that emanate from the government of national unit what I'm fascinated by though Mr President is the fact that now as revealed this weekend the executive is costing the fiscus and salaries over 600 million Rand you add VIP protection travel Etc this now starts to head towards the billions we are now heading towards the midterm budget policy statement and I'd like to ask the president given that we're cutting teachers healthcare workers Frontline Services particularly in education is the question could the president at least commit to cutting the executive more specifically Deputy ministers in order to free up resources for students in South Africa thank you The Honorable president thank you honorable chair all honorable members the issue of the size of the executive is a matter that has arisen on a number of occasions and when we did finally agreed to a government of national Unity for the seventh Administration I took the trouble to discuss it with the various leaders of the various political parties and I did say this is the reality that we now face as we establish the government of national Unity as we seek to engender stability in our country and said that for a time we will need to bear the cost to ensure that there is stability and we move forward with the government of national Unity I have said in the past that yes we do need to reduce our executive but this time due to the excy of the situation that we face as well as the circumstances that have been that we are subjected to we had to come to this point but we will keep an eye on the costs on an ongoing basis and in a two weeks or so the Minister of Finance will be delivering his medium-term policy budget statement and uh we will then be able to have light uh some light uh in terms of how the finances of our country will continue being managed it's a matter that is top of mind for me honorable myman uh it's not a matter that one is uh just happy with because we do need to ensure that every Rand is and advancing the overall interest of our people but right now in setting up the government of national Unity we had to get to this point but we will keep an eye on the expenditure side of our budget thank you honorable chairperson thank you honorable president honorable members question number 11 has been asked by The Honorable WT Leia the question is about recent organized criminal Syndicate violence which use kidnapping to extort money from victims and noting that some of those who have been arrested our police officers as well as a number of illegal foreign Nationals what are the full details of any policy changes regarding policing that he intends to implement the honorable president honorable house chair uh to honorable let see here uh yes a number of uh initiatives are underway initiatives that are also being embarked upon by our criminal justice uh colleagues in a much more focused Manner and in doing so quite a bit of progress is being made in a number of areas uh areas that include dealing with criminal syndicates and what has also been established and set up are the various uh tasks teams that are aimed at curbing uh criminality in our country and with all that we are beginning to see greater progress because the South African Police Service has adjusted its operational response to the threat the threats rather that are posed by organized criminal syndicates in particular uh with regards to kidnapping for ransom and extortion through various internal initiatives that they have embarked upon for instance the directorate for priority crime investigation employs what I would call a Project based approach to the investigation of serious organized crime and a dedicated capacity has also been established in the division detective and forensic services that is aimed at coordinating investigation into organized criminality the organized crime threat analysis process is makes use of a number of other mechanisms to identify existing and emerging organized crime threats and this they use as the basis of an appropriate multidisciplinary response operational command centers at District provincial and National levels further provide for coordination between the South African Police Service government departments and a number of other law enforcement agencies but this also includes cooperation with civil society partners with each kidnapping case a special joint operations committee is conv Leed to deal with those actions this consists of a multidisciplinary resource center to concentrate on the investigation of the kidnapping case as well as to deal with the safe release of victims and with regard to the proliferation Trends in extortion house chair a priority committee was established at National level to address the various types of extortion incidents that have emerged six distinct work streams have been established as part of this committee a committee which consists of also a multidisciplinary group of role players from the South African Police Service and both the public and private security sectors the external role players include the national Prosecuting Authority the financial Intelligence Center business leadership South Africa business Unity South Africa and the consumer goods Council of South Africa to identify South African Police Service members who may be involved in criminal activities the South African police itself employs specific Counter Intelligence measures in addition to routine Integrity testing measures such as verting the analysis of financial disclosures as well as lifestyle audits the South African police crime intelligence capability is an integral part of the Police Service multi-is AR approach to addressing organized crime working in collaboration with various other departments so honorable house chair I can say that much as we are facing enormous challenges in regard with regard to criminal incidents such as kidnapping extortion and many others the police service and indeed other mult multidisciplinary agencies are working very hard to ensure that this scourge of criminality is dealt with and dealt with effectively we are already seeing a great deal of progress in a number of areas and successes that are being recorded by the South African Police Service to working together with other agencies it might still be early days but I am convinced that we will continue seeing a great deal of progress thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president the first supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable WT Leia oh thank you Mr President for your comprehensive answer these organized crimes are crippling the economy there's no doubt and they need all of us to work together and I'm happy you said there's collaborative work uh from different um from different um AG uh agencies thank you Mr President Parliament must also play a role Mr President using our PCOS but when we use uh our PCOS uh to have collaborative works with the saps patrollers and the community at large some police stations are not responsive and they're not coming forward with certain things that communities uh are asking for and I heard Mr President you are saying there's progress that has been made in all of these things but when will the community uh start seeing the results of this collaborative work uh bearing fruits thank you very much the honorable president thank you honorable house chair I'm glad that honorable Lia has spoken about PCOS that immediately suggests that in whatever we do to fight the Spate of criminality we need to be focused on Community involvement and it is through Community involvement which can also be executed or done through community policing forums that we will be able to reduce the incidence of criminality it is quite often that criminals are known in the area where they operate people who perpetrate very various crimes are usually known and they can easily be pointed out by people who live in the community and it is for this reason that we've sought to ensure that we mobilize community policing forums and we also resource them I know that resourcing them is a huge task and with our fiscal constraints we have not really been able to lay out sufficient resources to enable all of them to do their work but where they function well we found that incidents of criminality do reduce quite significantly and it is so that through our PCOS we could be able to empower our communities through the various structures that exist in our communities be they community policing for us School governing bodies Sports organizations and church organizations including stock fils wherever they are if we engage with them and various structures of our own political parties we should be able to have eyes on the ground that can help in informing the police and various agencies that are mandated to deal with with acts of criminality so empowering and mobilizing our PCOS would be something of great help thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president honorable members the second supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable zbi thank you honorable house chair honorable president the rise of extortion is part of a pattern of intelligence failures from the financing of terrorism abroad from within our country fake business forums a military training camp in panga and now this extortion and kidnapping pandemic they all point to a serious failure of intelligence as we are always reacting are we going to see an overhaul of the National Intelligence infrastructure to protect the people and our economy thank you The Honorable president on honorable house chair we are paying attention to the effectiveness of our intelligence uh structures be they SSA military intelligence and uh also the ones in the police uh on an ongoing basis and the various reports that we received either following uh what happened to the uh SSA uh which was given which report was uh led by Professor mamadi or what happened during the July unrest uh those reports spoke to yes the weaknesses that are prevalent in some of our agencies those are being attended to on an ongoing basis very actively and also through the legislative uh processes that this house has been involved in and we are proceeding to ensure that we renew we rebuild our agencies and we strengthen them as well as to empower them to be able to do their work more effectively it is a process that is underway but I am confident that that we will be able to succeed in ensuring that our intelligence agencies do actively give out information which can be acted on to prevent Spades of criminality and also ensure that there is greater safety in our country thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president honorable members the third supplementary question will be asked by the The Honorable DM sosana you house shair Mr President it will seems that the findings highlighted by the independent panel on the July 2021 riots are once more corroborated that you fail to convin the National Security Council where all the intelligence matters at discuss was at the center of a poor and reactive response by the police given the persistent failure of the intelligent agents operating in office to tly detect the evil work of an organized criminal Syndicate and extortionist as eviden by the reactive and some sometimes surprised police when was the last time that the National Security Council met and what are the reason that the N the NSC is not meeting regularly and Mr President please protect us as well because some of your members are sleeping here and I just want to say to you the da Leed Helen zill coalition government they won't get thank you Mr President The Honorable president all the honorable members honorable house chair the question was when did the National Security Council meet I'm pleased to inform the honorable member that it met two days ago thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president honorable members the last supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable koani thank you very much uh house chairperson honorable President we do note with appreciation The increased number of arrests thanks to the ramping up of int Ence but it is very concerning that there's still a high number of police officers and illegal foreigners that collude with criminal syndicates not only is this bringing shame to the badge of the policeman but it also demotivates the hardworking and honest men and women in the police force it also negatively affects the national Integrity because foreign Nationals have become comfortable in engaging in activities of criminal acts what are the mechanisms mechanisms and the strategies in the interim to protect communities especially the whistleblowers who have to contact the same police stations that are infiltrated by members and also how are we going to monitor the authenticity and the impact of some of the U measures that you have mentioned like lifestyle audits so that those who are part of high level investigations at present are not infiltrated by the very same syndicates thank you The Honorable president thank you honorable house chair the process of ensuring that we monitor not only the activities of members of syndicates but also the members within uh the police service or other criminal justice agencies is an ongoing one and it's being pursued quite vigorously to ensure that we do not see a recurring process where uh these criminal syndicates have their either moles or uh people who have been captured uh in our security services or agencies it is ongoing and obviously processes like lifestyle audit are reviewed on an ongoing basis and there's a close monitoring of those and we are heightening our own alertness through the various arms of of the state and in the end as we make progress which you alluded to right at the beginning that there are higher number of arrests and intelligence is showing clear signs of improving of improvement we will continue in that vein to make sure that in the end we do get on top of these acts of criminality both inside our own ranks as well as outside thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president honorable members the last question on today's order paper has been asked by The Honorable the leader of the opposition the question notes that the president has withdrawn abandoned his application to the Constitutional Court to review the recommendations of the report of the section 89 independent panel and whether he intends to deal with the findings and recommendations of the report of the section 89 independent panel in light of his commitment to fight corruption The Honorable president on the 13th of December 2022 the National Assembly resolved not to refer the report of section 89 independent panel to an inquiry in doing so the National Assembly was exercising its powers as well as responsibilities as outlined in the Constitution and it's in in its own rules as of today investigations conducted by a wide range of independent law enforcement agencies have been finalized the South African Revenue Service the South African Reserve Bank the public protector and the directorate for priority crimes investigations have all concluded investigations into the matter I could say that none of these bodies have found that there was any wrongdoing on my part as was my obligation constitutionally and legally I cooperated with each and every one of these institutions without any form of interference I answered their questions provided them with information they required and sought and where requested made myself available for interviews the decision by the Constitutional Court to dismiss my application for direct access to the court to review The Independent panel's report was not a determination on the substance of my application it should be noted that the Constitutional Court will hear arguments in November on whether or not this house in resolving as it did in December 2022 failed to fulfill its obligations under the con stitution I myself have full faith and confidence that the court will decide the issue before it in a comprehensive and final manner the fight against corruption is a priority of this government and will remain so we will continue to capacitate as I've said law enforcement agencies at the center of this fight against corruption and we will support the independence of Institutions who must act without fear or favor and I'd like to repeat that I will continue to support those agencies I thank you thank you honorable president the first supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable the leader of the opposition right thank you very much honorable house chair Mr President here is the follow-up question sir the MK party is deeply concerned that not withstanding overwhelming evidence agencies such as SARS the S afan Reserve Bank the Hawks the public protector as well as the NPA the heads of all those agencies are appointed by you say they have cleared you of wrongdoing they this contradicts the findings of an independent panel which was appointed in terms of section 89 and ched by The Honorable members honorable leader of the opposition can you just hold there please honorable members the person who asked the question the member who ask the question have 2 minutes to make an intervention followed by the question now if we get these type of interjections it will not be possible for the president or for myself then to ultimately hear what the follow-up question is can we give the member a fair opportunity please The Honorable leader of the opposition thank you this order the panel that was led by retired chief justice Noble concludes that there was a case to answer in as much as you violated your out of office and you also implicated in the corruption at Pala Pala far the question is this sir given that in South Africa we transit in rant and the reports indicate that dollars were found at palapala are you now in a position to finally take this house into confidence and tell us the truth that that these transactions had nothing to do with a legitimate business because you cannot conduct a business whilst you are serving as a president of this country and and also was the person who cleared you at NPA was that person Ved thank you The Honorable president or honorable members the president uh thank you honorable house chair honorable Cloe has asked a variety of questions and I did say in my head reply that this matter was dealt with by the National Assembly and the National Assembly took a decision and that decision is now subject of litigation in the Constitutional court and I would like to respectfully say we should allow that process to unfold and it should be a matter that will be dealt with with that by that court and the variety of other questions that The Honorable member has asked were responded to in a a variety of uh institutions that have dealt with this matter and also dealt with the issue of um uh either the president was conducting business or not and all those issues were ventilated and the information has been open to the public either through court papers or reports that have been issued so I'd like to submit that these matters have been addressed responded to and the other matter is subject to litigation in a very open and transparent manner through our judicial system thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable uh president the second supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable MBA thank you very much house chair honorable president South Africa as a country is confronted by the sketch of cancerous corruption that devat uh public resources towards patrimonial interest that undermines inclusive development of our country and Corruption does not sit well for investment mobilization therefore honorable president what are the practical steps that our government is taking to support and strengthen law en enforcement agencies to uproot corruption thank you very much house chair The Honorable president thank you honorable house chair yes the government is committed not only to support but to strengthen our law enforcement agencies by ensuring that the right people are appointed by ensuring that they work in accordance with the rule of law but also that the agencies have the resources that they require but more importantly to assure them and to grant them and give them a clear guarantee that they must work independently without any fear favor or prejudice against anyone or from anyone and in doing so we ensure that they do the work that they must do and they must do it to the best of their ability and if there are any issues or doubts those should be able to be followed up through our various processes and we have a number of agencies that enable our commitment to rule of law and and to our democracy to function one of the good things about our country is that we have institutions country that does not have institutions that are functional has a democracy that is wobbly and in our case the strengthening of our institutions is something that is prominent in my mind and in the determination of the government to ensure that there is root of Law and that there is commitment to doing the right things through the various institutions thank you honorable chair thank you honorable president the third supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable Zula thank you house chair greetings uh Mr President greetings The Honorable members and greetings to the progressive caucus Mr President you are the first citizen of the country you are the person that should Inspire confidence that we have systems of Law and Order that are independent and Justice is blind in our country yet after being implicated in serious breach of the law is supposed to inspire confidence to South Africans are South African supposed to believe that everyone is equal before the law when ordinary citizens are arrested for holding Undeclared foreign currency violation of section 34 of pra amongst amongst others yet The Reserve Bank the NPA and the SARS sees nothing wrong with palapala the independent panel report Mr President still stands and has not been set aside by any court of law and not only is it legally binding but it should be binding to your conscience as well the Mr president the question is does it not matter to you that a report pned by a reputable former Chief Justice found that there's Prima faki evidence that you violated the Constitution a constitution that you did not only member Your Time Is Now expired The Honorable president thank you thank you honorable house chair and thank thank you honorable zungul it's the first time I ever he heard you extend greetings to me so thank you so much honorable house chair I did say that it was the National Assembly which I am not a member of took a decision on that report and as we speak now now that report has been challenged or the decision of the National Assembly has been challenged and is now before the highest court in the land and I do think that that process should be allowed to unfold because as I've often said we have institutions institutions that are meant to guard our democracy to ensure that there's rule of law I do believe that that's precisely what we should do and allow that process to unfold thank you honorable house chair thank you honorable president honorable members the last supplementary question will be asked by The Honorable JS malma thank you very much uh president um you are aware that we are the ones who take who have taken this matter on review yes at the Constitutional court because we don't believe that what Parliament did was correct double joery she dealt with that thing when she was a mayor there was a president here and announced that there is primi evidence but not winnable as we speak today is in court unlike the former mayor of not because you answering any case but because you are taking the nation into your time is Mandela did that on

NwmL9wzA8L0,Matric Exams | Calls for more efforts to curb copying,2024-10-17T12:18:54Z,481,"over 900 cases of copying were reported in the 2023 National senior certificate examinations and over 1,000 cases in the 2022 examinations to remedy the situation basic education Minister C gube suggest the country will have to go digital of course you can't necessarily um you know anticipate uh unfortunate circumstances and that's why I think in the future sir one of the things that we would really want to do is to see how we digitalize a lot more the the the the management of the exam process in terms of the management of the exam papers in the future so that we can also come to the you know the the the 21st century see how we can minimize human manipulation in that process one Educators union says they would welcome the idea but with certain reservations whenever a human is uh is involved there can be manipulation of certain aspects and I just think that um we need to make sure every one of us each one of us that the Integrity of the examination is protected and um and if digitalization assists us with that it will be good but otherwise I'm a bit hesitant at this stage just to just to say let's completely go on with with with with digitalization but it is a it is a easier way in handling certain aspects but again there will be human um human intervention somewhere in the process L organization cus says going digital will be welcomed if it does not exclude those in disadvantaged areas we welcome the initiative technology can enhance efficiency security and accessibility in the education system however we must address the digital divide and ensure equal access to digital resources especially to Learners in Rural and disadvantaged areas the National Association of governing bodies is skeptical about this idea it's easy once you go because these papers will be done a week and so then these people will get will get the answers and the memorandums a week before they go and write and and just go there and and just present a paper that has already reled so I don't think it will work I really don't don't unless unless I'm convinced otherwise the minister will will sit with us and tell us how how is he going to do that and I is going to ensure that there is no copy over 700,000 candidates are expected to sit for the national senior certificate examinations from October 21st to November 28th news e"
bHB4uSjn5qs,Spotlight on impact of global digital exclusion - Sumsub's Hannes Bezuidenhout weighs in,2024-10-17T12:16:40Z,282,Sam sub which is a full cycle verification platform says there's a massive 627 million people globally who due to lack of digital access are excluded from accessing essential Digital Services which include Financial Services education healthare and education platforms among others it says their lack of participation in the digital economy represents the equivalent of 30 trillion Rand loss to the digital economy so how can these excluded individuals be brought back back into the digital fold well I'm joined by Hannis Biden Hut he's the Vice President of Sales Africa uh at Sam sub thank you very much for joining us Hannah so you indicate that some 627 million people who are digitally excluded represent a $1.7 trillion loss to the global economy please elaborate yeah so I mean we launched a project green flag and it's good to put it into a nation or a country because it it brings the the the the numbers to to life right so if you take 627 people that's the third biggest country in the world that's those people don't have access to financial tools um you know all the products and services that we take for granted so you know getting to that number if you if you go to our website that we created just for this uh green flag project you'll see how we came to these statistics but 1.7 trillion lost you know there's a financial loss and then there's also societal impact also people not having access to these tools not being able to um you know get credit because they don't have the right documents uh those type of things so I'm assuming part of the reason for digital exclusion are economic reasons you know people can't access because they can't afford so what from your view are the reasons why people are digitally excluded well if you look at the white paper that we've got we broke it down into four sections so firstly it's identity documents so some people don't have identity documents or they've got temporary documents Refugee type of documents um we still have those green um ID books and you know it was nice the first time we went and we picked it up and then the first time it goes through the washing machine it looks like a tampered document then uh secondly uh you've got people that struggle with digital literacy so when they get onto these applications or you know onto these platforms they don't really know how to navigate it how to make use of dropdown menus and then we've we've also broken it down to people that their physical features have changed you know hair loss or there was like a medical uh thing that happened so um in that white paper we actually speak about a person that lost his eye and he couldn't access um his platform due to biometric tests and then finally the fourth category was highrisk countries so people get uh you know preemptively rejected just because they're from a high risk country doesn't mean they're high risk indeed so what can be done then to ensure that people who've been marginalized can come into the digital economy fold um it's it's a I think Regulators need to take hands with businesses and with identity verification platform providers like ourselves um making it easier for people to on board onto a solution uh Sam sub's got a great solution called nonoc verification so you don't even need a document we you type in your ID number and you take a selfie and we check against the department of Home Affairs and we say listen this is Hest Hest is good we've checked them out and we've launched that globally and across a multitude of countries in Africa and also we've got a non-op proof of address so um I think when when making it easier is making the user Journey easier catering for people that digital literacy side of things and then just having not not preemptively rejecting people but allowing them into the platform and that's also another thing that's quite amazing is where Sams Up is not just identity verification we do the full monitoring so you allow the person in allow him to use your application and whenever he shows bad or illicit you know actions then you can reject him yeah I'm I'm seeing a little bit of a hurdle there in your response because uh people are not those people who are not digitally connected how would they even get onto your platform to begin with uh how would you resolve for that and and ultimately how would you ensure that they have that digital literacy to be able to even even know about you and and know where to find you and that's that's a great observation I mean if you look at Africa and we if we take it into green flag terms the green flag population is is is made up a lot of Africa because Africa is highly unbanked I think 45% of people have got bank accounts throughout Africa adults so you've got some territories which don't even have internet they they don't have you know they have to travel far so it's regulation they need to go into physically into a bank to open those accounts but with technology moving forward and all these fintechs that that that have are launching amazing products it's just becoming so much easier to um get into that space I mean starlink is another solution it's it's disc connecting the world you know so as time goes by you know it will get better there's a digital divide and we we see that and that's why people need to take hands with businesses and Regulators to make sure that we we can help these digital people that struggled with the literacy to uh get them uh to understand how to onboard and it's all everybody working together indeed one last thing Hannis and as quick as you can I suppose there's not I suppose there's not much one can do in those instances where certain countries decide to deliberately cut off the internet from their citizens it might be because of you know fears of political INF infiltration or whatever it may be so what happens then yeah I mean I've been thinking about that quite you know what happens if if you don't can't access anything so I mean in that instance that comes down to the government and it's like I said The Regulators need to allow people to have access to these platforms it needs to be a human right anybody needs to be able to access a platform to get credit is it for operation is it for a life- saving procedure is it for someone to fix their car to get to work so I mean that just comes down to the government not stopping people or blocking people out from these platforms indeed hnis thank you so much for speaking to us that was hnis Biden height he's the vice president vice president for sales Africa at suub
HllqaFraYwM,Medical aid contribution to increase in 2025,2024-10-17T12:11:13Z,402,Medical Aid scheme contributions are set to increase quite substantially in 2025 best med and medihelp are raising contributions by 12.75% and 10.8% respectively while Bonitas is increasing contributions by 10.2% momentum by 99.4% and Discovery by 9.3% these increases are way ahead of average inflation which has steadily been coming down and have historically always overshot inflation so how sustainable is this trend and what are the drivers of these increases well to unpack the issues for us I'm joined by paresh Prema he's head of Actuarial services at Alex Forbes thank you very much for joining us sir so these are whopping increases for South Africans who are already struggling to make ends meet but what are the key drivers behind these increases goodday yes so the main drivers for this increases is CPI so that's the basis but then medical schemes need to understand the the increases Beyond CPI due to membership aging and utilization which usually adds a 2 to 3% above CPI what we seeing now is increases almost double that which means that medical schemes are facing cost pressures that they need to pass on as contribution increases driven more than just by CPI but actually the risk profile of the membership one of of the things that you highlight in the document that you sent me was the issue of a lot of young people who deciding not to take up medical AIDS uh because you know it's like it's a grudge expenditure and they're young they don't think they'll get sick they don't think they'll die so you also say that as a result of that um there isn't the cross subsidization that would ordinarily be needed to ensure that those premiums come down just tell us more about that yes so as I mentioned it's a garage purchase and because of it being honorous in terms of f for younger people they sort of hold off on being a member unless they need it for certain benefits so what happens is that cross subsidy is lost and the remaining members need to subsidize their benefits from whoever's left in the RIS pool and that leads to increased cost Beyond CPI it would be useful if we could get more members in those younger age groups to come on but medical schemes also face by providing minimum benefits which do come at a significant cost so that is already something that they need to account for they can't really cut contribution rates uh and provide benefits at that rates because there is a minimum that they need to pay for and that is already included in the cost of medical schemes so you've given us some rationale around the drivers of the increases but why do the 2025 contribution increases look so so much higher than in previous years so what we find is um due to the effect of the increased use of benefits mainly driven by maybe high cost cases and late DET detection of uh you know High costing illnesses like cancers some medical schemes may have encountered them in years after Co we've seen in the in the last few years since Co some medical schemes had more than double CPI increases and some had lower and we've seen the similar Trend with some of the medical schemes if you see there's a range of 12.75 to 9.3 some medical schemes have had a better year this year some have cases that are higher costing and that's why they need to increase their contribution so it's not a one- siiz foit all every medical scheme has to look at their own individual experience before they determine the contribution increases for 2025 yeah so while some of the arguments you're putting forward make sense I mean the question has been asked about escom tariffs as well um the same applies to these Medical Aid contributions and the rate of increase if this continues is it really sustainable and you know what then becomes the future of Medical Aid schemes if people can't afford to pay their contributions so what we find most of uh medical schem members are in formal employment a lot of them may have um employer subsidies or ways in which it makes the contributions of affordable but we do know even though medical schemes are garage purchased the alternative is uh being vulnerable to go to facilities in the state or paying out of pocket which is unaffordable to many so we find that households will probably forgo some other benefits or payments that they have to actually contribute to Medical schemes but unsustainable meaning it you can't continue having increases above CPI without members actually uh leaving but we do know that once we have seen the experience increase for some of the schemes we do expect that it would not be an a year onye increase that is more than double CPI it's a correction that we seeing medical schemes doing but it shouldn't be something that is maintained for many years in the future yeah speaking of many years in the future let's just fast forward to that time when the nhi is established whenever that's going to be what will that mean for Medical Aid contributions when it's fully fledged so in in terms of the nhi act it mentions a time at at which the nhi will be fully funded or fully operational so we know it's a phased approach as as time goes by where the nhi will be established and it will determine the benefits it will it will pay at some point in the future when the benefits are fully funded and will be funded by the different sources of revenue that it states in the ACT medical schemes then would have to provide complimentary benefits meaning those benefits not provided by the nhi and at that point medical schems will probably be um an optional purchase and not a compulsory purchase for some people at this point who have to you know they have no other alternative but that is still very undefined at this point because the package hasn't been determined the sources of revenue are not finalized but we will have to wait and see when that actually happens indeed thank you so much pesh for your time there and your sites paresh Premier he's the head of Actuarial services at Alex Forbes

of Nelson Mandela this site is the first to be nominated from the African Liberation Heritage program aligning with the African Union's Vision 2063 and reaffirming South Africa's commitment to reconciliation peace and human dignity I believe that I further demonstrated my commitment to preserving South Africa's Rich cultural heritage by delivering a keyote address at the oral history conference in ulundi guul Natal in October the Conference held under the theme forgotten stories and marginalized experiences 30 years later brought together experts to explore how oral history and digital technology can be harnessed to preserve the country's diverse and of often overlooked Nar narratives in conjunction with this event I participated in the National symbols and patriotism promotion ceremony at szak Cora High School reinforcing the importance of cultural Pride amongst the youth on public private Partnerships as the ministry we have prioritized fostering public P private Partnerships to revitalize critical programs with the department and to create opportunities for greater participation in sports arts and culture and Heritage a prime example of this was my visit to the inos mauka equian sports center Center in suu where we have explored possible upgrades and Partnerships to improve the facility the center has the potential to open new doors for equian sports which have historically lacked representation in South Africa sporting landscape another key initiative that I spearheaded together with the minister is the Revival of school sports we have been unwavering in our goal to ensuring that every child in school is engaged in sport the Arts or cultural activities this holistic approach is vital to the development of well-rounded young South Africans who will go on to contribute to the nation's growth and unity and provide proof that government of national Unity is indeed working well for all citizens on social cohesion and nation building as part of the Department's mission to promote social cohesion and nation building I have successfully led the kufa festival in the Free State this past weekend this Festival not only celebrated South Africa's cultural diversity but also contributed to job creation by stimulating Local Economic activities in areas such as Hospitality small businesses and cultural tourism I've also supported several important initiatives that honor South Africa's leg living Legions and promote its Rich cultural heritage this include the fanuka AF project where we paid a KES visit to Mama Abigail Kua and the nalang road to 25 years project which aims to preserve the legacy of music legend mandoza additionally I participated in the Mondo Heritage Festival and the Deep slau Carnival both of which underscored the importance of celebrating and preserving the country's cultural heritage on International engagements I have in the past 100 days represented South Africa at several high-profile international events at the International Film week in Moscow held in August I delivered a keynote address focusing on the emerence of South Africa's cultural and creative Industries as Catalyst for job creation social cion and Innovation during the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics I let the South African delegation offering messages of support to the athlets and representing the country on an international stage in laka Zambia I was delegated by the minister to oversee the repatriation of the Mortal remains of South African Freedom Fighters ensuring they were retained with dignity and respect to be honored on home soil thank you very much with that I want to invite the minister to come and give his accountability for the past 100 days thank you very much Minister are a very short person here I always tell tell people that when I became a minister one of the things I looked the most forward to was to say all protocol observed because I've heard that word that every government function and today I want to say all protocol observed because everybody here is very special and very dear to our hearts before I start thought I know the media has deadlines and some came here to come in here so let me get the uncomfortable out of the way before I go into the good work that we've done you know I was in the news for spending money going to Paris past two days I had to answer being called a joy right now I don't understand when there's a sporting event I I first got very angry because they were comparing me to they said I removed Mama joy and I replaced myself with her so I got angry at but then I realized being a government uh uh official you must be transparent you have taken on something that you can't get angry when people ask you about their money because every scent that we are using is belonging to the people now I was annoyed for 10 minutes but when that realization came I realized that I must answer and I'm going to answer very transparently here and if there's any media person that still feel that I've not adequately answered please I will remain behind so that you can go back to the news room having all your questions answered number one my first trip as a minister the first one as a minister not as a person as a minister was to the Olympics I came a week before the Olympics start I attended six different meetings I attended a meeting with the minister of aeran I attended a meeting with the African ministers I've attended a meeting with the Commonwealth ministers I've attended the opening ceremony I've also attended uh a meeting standing in for the minister of police where they had all the police there so I had six meetings I had to attend now before the opening ceremony the rugby already started for those that don't know so I went to go and watch the seventh rugby then when the Olympics started I sat in the rain so that our athletes also can have somebody screaming for them there and then I realized because I was so excited for this new job I have I want to learn I'm going to come back back I'm probably the only minister in the world of sport that was not at the Olympics now where do you get the joy writing from so I want to make it very clear I came back not because I was forced to come back there was nothing wrong me being there now he's going to sporting events that's my job do you want me to go look at cabes and the agriculture that is the job of Mr John Ste to look at The Farms you can't that's my job to go to sporting events yeah especially the biggest showcasing of talent in the sporting World which is the Olympics I didn't go to the par Olympics and that's not an achievement not to go and I'm still going to go to all the sporting events because that's government now you want to portray me as a person that there taking a joy right that thing you can do with other ministers you've chosen the wrong one because I am flying first class all the time with my own money and now I must fly business class so it's not an upgrade for me it's a downgrade locally i f business class but as a minister you must fly economy class the other day I was flying was my partner and she said can't we book you because my knees are so long cuz I can't sit now and then I must stand up so that I can but that's what the ministerial handbook demands of me it demands of me to fly business class to fly uh economy class locally I fly twice a week and I fly economy class internationally the mysterial handbook demands of me to fly business and not first class I'm mentioning this so that people can know I've not done anything outside the ministerial handbook I got there I saw them saying Mr McKenzie welcome welcome jump in the car now it's being acted like I'm sitting behind the computer and go to the different airlines wish things that's there are people that are hired for those now if you want to play politics it's fine but don't play politics only with me if I have to account which I'm doing we expect every minister to also account because this is important to all of you I've done absolutely nothing wrong and I'm as transparent as possible I went there in fact when I saw it's 125,000 rents for five star hotel I myself and the acting DG we both said we can't do this isn't there cheap hotel I flew I I I I stayed in a fourstar hotel which was a bit cheaper because it was during the Olympics all the prices were up and you can't compare Euros with rents our currency is not that strong and now people want to act like particularly in the da that it's my first time going overseas 20 2007 I stayed for a month in Paris to watch the Rugby World Cup to watch the Rugby World Cup for one month I flew there first class I stayed in a seven star hotel for one month now because he's no longer my my own money and I must follow the rules if the rules says I must fly economy class I shall fly economy class so I wanted to just get that out of the way all the media that's here we can still talk about if you have any further questions about the trip but don't say I went for a joy right and don't compare me to Mama Joy I am not a super fan I'm the minister of sport arts and culture the second issue which is also in the media at the moment I just want to get those two out of the way and then I come to the work I've done the issue of the spring book they say the spring B is are being the the the spring box is being sold all those things I think I just want to bring context because I saw other political parties says I didn't even know about it I was sleeping on the job you see hey Floyd must come back what I to say three months ago saru met with me and they presented the deal to me to say this is what we want to do we are we need money there's no money in sa rugby most rugby unions around the world and federations are experience a cash crisis when I looked at a deal I said to them we will meet in one week they came in one week I said to them there's something I don't agree with on the deal there's no South Africans in this deal they said thank you Minister we will come back to you they then came back and they said Minister we have included South Africans now in the deal the law of FIFA and the International Rugby uh federations you can't interfere in soccer and in rugby you can do it on a certain level so I can only urge but I can't truly fully instruct because that might be deemed as interference and then you get banned so what they did they came back they said they've got South African Partners now I said all right if that's the case it's good then we got complaints my office got complaints from the Rugby Union feder uh presidents so they were supposed to vote today I then said stop that meeting let us meet again so everybody can be happy with a deal so that's where we where we are with a deal I didn't see this deal the other day when some political party was giving a statement I've been working I've even met the echi uh Company the company that's buying I've met the owners the brothers of that company the owners I've met them I've engaged with them so that I can make sure that South African springborg rights are not being sold for a song so I hope I've made that one clear enough about that let me go to the work that I've done I must first think you know I've never met the deputy Minister and maybe you don't know it but I think you know it there's a lot of tension I've picked up between ministers and Deputy ministers so much so that the president called us in and he says we need to be collegial we need to be collegial with our ministers and when I met her for the first time I tried to Google her but I didn't see much about her on Google but when she walked into our first meeting I knew I'll be fine when she said I we Mas and I want to say to the deputy Minister you know thank you so much for who you are to this country who you are to me we work truly nicely together and we have our things we defin a lot because she's a very strong woman and she doesn't let me always get my way and she would say no but I disagree and for that I want to say I've also learned so much from her and I can tell you without a doubting the g& I have the best Deputy Ministers of all the ministers in the then I want to thank the president for appointing me as the minister of sport arts and culture people want me to talk bad about a man that has given me this job I can never do that you know 22 years ago 21 years ago we went looking for a job I I think they got there and they said no they can't give me a job I mean to work at at the back of a truck they didn't want to give me the job cuz they said I come from jail and the manager there said no you can't get a job you come from jail but the man that saw past my past and say come here I will give you this job I must now fight that man I'm not m in my head I am not fighting I will never fight the president I will disagree with him but I'm not here I love the gnu the Patriotic alliance members are very happy with my inclusion in the gnu how can I listen to other parties all right let me start with the work the first thing and the most proudest thing I've done since becoming a minister and being part of was when we together with the Department of Defense and military veterans together with the office staff you know I am so fortunate that I've inherited the best stuff you can get you know usually you'll just hear people talk a lot of stuff about people but there people working at DC I can tell you without a doubt I don't even want to change one of them because they are diligent they are so happy I allow them to do their work and we are working very nicely together these people is the reason why I've done my proudest thing which is number one we brought back the remains of Our Heroes Dum no pezel February to maik and all of them they were in Exile and they died in Exile and they were buried in ex we manage as a team not as McKenzie or as M as a team inter departmental my team I must say worked day and night flued between Zambia you know mrma and them they worked to get that so I want to say that's the first thing and the most proudest thing I've been involved in the first crisis I got was when we started which talk about later when we started talking to UFC and F1 uh and Motorsport uh FIA we started just engagements I got a media inquiry that was our first my first crisis was that Mr McKenzie 12 countries are stuck for the fber basketball tournament in South Africa the under 18 African basketball championship is in South Africa Africa and we are now being told it's being cancelled I said no no no no there's nothing being cancelled I went back I called sasco I called I called the Basketball Association I called everybody to an urgent meeting within an hour after that call and what I heard in that meeting was the worst news they were given they applied to host this tournament in South Africa they didn't have sponsors they didn't pay the venue they didn't pay the hotel they have didn't pay uh for the buses they paid for nothing when I asked them what you going to do they like nothing we must cancel I said excuse me nothing it can't be this will be on South Africa's record I called the team I called the adg I called the whole team we then made sure we I called the president of FBA in mozambik myself luckily I have met him in Olympics at the Olympics and he said something I'll never forget he was very angry when I called him but he cooled off he says no I said please give us a last chance we'll fix it he says I believe you because you're a good man I said why do you say I'm a good man he says you walked into the room you walk past a lot of people but you came straight to me in Paris and you greeted me what he did didn't know what everybody was speaking French and I look at the black guy in the corner I thought that is my guy and and I can tell you the people literally didn't sleep and we managed to host the basketball feba tournament under 18 and we saved South Africa from headlines that was my first crisis the second crisis I experienced was the National School of the Arts was a about to close down they couldn't pay salaries they ran out of money I was then told you know sometimes uh people will tell you stuff they said Minister you can't intervene because it doesn't fall under you I said this is the G andu we do things differently I'm going to intervene I saw this Arts the Arts is calling my name I went to the school I saw they turn around they have no turnaround strategy but these people are good people that ran into money they couldn't even pay the salaries I immediately with the powers vested in me as the minister told the ad go through the processes let's save the jobs let's save the teachers not from leing we then gave the school 2 million rents so that they can pay salaries and they can pay water and lights but when I walked out I saw the hostels where the girls are staying I wouldn't even let my dog sleep in those places I then went back and I said to them we have to fix the hostels as I'm because we've got the infrastructure Grant as I'm speaking to you the hostels are being fixed and the girls are going to play in a proper place the electricity problem we're also sorting out with the city of Johannesburg the third crisis I got was as you can see I was just dealing with crisises the first I said I don't drink alcohol Kenny the deputy president of P says every time I call you you've got a crisis you must just drink whiskey and then relax so I'm very near getting that whp the third crisis we got was the under 20 the youth championship in Peru there was no money for the people to go to the for the atlet to go to Peru there was no money they needed a 4 million rents to go to Peru I tell you I pick up the phone I called a few corporates and you know super sport was the first one that said we will help and superport helped we called the adg the adg said we must help the the the deputy Minister said no we have to help and we came together together with super sport and the deputy Minister and I can tell you true story 10 minutes before they close the flight we paid 10 minutes before they Clos the flight now if we didn't pay let me tell you the repercussions of that none of them would have gone to Peru today the whole world knows we have the fastest under 20 100 met atlete the fastest under 20 200 met atlete we got gold medals we got different medals all because of the intervention of myself and the deputy minister so you know the president will always speak about job creation I was told at the office that some people said Minister we just come to say bye-bye because next week our contract is finishing I said bye-bye where you going now we've been we just working on contract do you have another job no I don't have another job Minister but we enjoyed working with you I called the adg I said how many are they she said there are 66 I said can we meet tonight I remember she's like Minister it's 9900 p.m. I said yeah let's meet at 11:00 p.m. at the office see she said I'm going to enjoy making this call to the Senior Management and when I got there 11:00 they were there we sat from 11: until 2: a.m. trying to redirect and reprioritize funds so we can save the job of 66 people because that's the priority of the gnu I can stand before you today and say that we have managed to save a year until we get them permanent but they've got a job and until March 2025 but before March 2025 we shall meet again at 11:00 to make a plan so you can't create jobs if you can't save jobs so we've already saved 66 jobs in our department then this one is very hard s artist in this country I want to make it clear I'm not a minister of condolences I'm not a minister of funerals I was told you didn't come to the funeral of mutti but they omitted to say I gave money for the funeral of mutti but it can be we must be honest about this it's not easy to say it but I'm going to say it we are not here to bury artist artists need to live a life so good that they manage that they can bury themselves it's insulting for a person didn't have bread but you put them in a casket of 50,000 rents it it's not right so we should not fight so ARS should be buried we should fight for artist to live right because of my corporate history I looked at why is it that our artists are poor and I found three things number one artists are poor because they get exploited by their record labels number two artists are poor because the people representing artists can't even account for for the money that we give them now if you can't account for the money that we give you how are you going to account to the people that you represent if the Moi you can't give him the papers he wants so there's the problem we then called all of the artist number we realize that artists sometimes are good artists but they maybe and creative they're not good business people you can't be everything in life I'm a good business person but I'm not a good artist and sometimes they represent themselves in contract and they get exploited I then called a group of lawyers of the Arts I said we are going to pay you as the government you must look through every new contract every artist is going to sign in this country so that you must make sure that artist don't get exploited and artist will not pay for that service the department will pay for that service we then we then called the boss Barat in that boss Barat that we called we had Frank discussions we built up different sectors and those sectors we're going to pay for their offices we're going to pay for the we're going to give them bought fees we are going to make sure that the sectors represent the artist you can't have one person representing writers film makers uh Crafters uh choir music every sector should be represented by sectorial people people that understand their problem so we have a boss and there 72 sectors and sub sector organizations which I want to make clear they will be getting money from us so that they can run and agitate for the better behavior from corporates from government and make sure artists get truly represented and we cannot as Government say we care about artists but we don't want to recognize them as workers I'm busy fighting artist together with minister to so artist can bees can be known as they can be recognized as workers the copyright Amendment bill they want the president to sign it but I went to go read it I said the president must not sign this thing in my mind and I spoke to them because how do you sign something that says and I speak from experience because I'm I'm a writer all the books I wrote I own the copyright right to it if you want to use one sentence there you're going to pay me if you want to use a comma you're going to pay me and and and and then we are in big discussions with one of the biggest movie houses abroad and we are negotiating on price because they talk to me cuz I owe my work in the copyright Amendment bill there's a line that says free use you can't have that fair use how do you have fair use you don't go to McDonald's and say a burger is 80 rents but I've got 40 rents give me a burger because of fair use so why must artist music be used so once we fix those little things we will come back and we will sign it and we will make sure that when you die you look at Shak Zulu Henry one of the best actors this country has ever produced Saka Zulu come from When We Were Young till today they still play Saka but he gets nothing artists will be paid to be on a on on a on a show I remember there this uh show called that was a uh uh what you call it where they make fun of people what was it called no no they make fun where Ken Kun was on it was called the roast when they came for the roast to Ken he they gave him back and he said are you mad can you say this is what I want they say we can never pay you that because the other artists if they see we pay you this much they will also demand that from us he says I'm not going after a year they came back to him they like all right I'm paying you this amount he says no a year at passed I must put more and they paid him the money so I just want to say that's what we want to do and then today I want to tell you I want to thank the sabc and super spot multi choice I want to thank them openly because the most important rugby game I went to them it we fought I think they were very irritated with me I fought so that every South African can watch that rugby game but I didn't only fight I learned from sabc I learned from Super Spot I learned from them and what I learned from them is that it is our responsibility of government to make sure that our people get to watch these games we can't put it on them we must put it on us so what I've done they were telling me all those things I said yeah we will talk let's just show this one on Saturday and I'll go back and today I want us to give sabc and Super Sport a hand because Super Sport graciously said let South Africa watch the game and we did watch the game and I can assure you that that we are doing our work in cabinet to make sure we make sport accessible and we pay uh uh What uh companies demand for their product so that is something that is ongoing I also want to say you know for me I'm going to make you one example while I talk about Super Sport we've got something big and you must encourage people to apply uh We've joined forces with super sport Athletics South Africa South African School athletics and the of basic education in launching the track plus Field School athletic series starting in January next year the school atletic series is open to all high schools throughout the country the objective will be to Crown the top Athletics high schools in the country both boys and girls at under 15 16 and 17 levels will participate we want to go and find our athletes and we have now joined forces with a corporate company that will help bu so the children must now get reenter spots and it's not just talk we have signed an agreement with the Department of basic education sport arts and culture must get back to our school most of us here there's over the age of 40 don't need to put up your hand most of us here you have had school spot I was a top athlete myself believe it or not and I was discovered at the school so so we've got the DStv School netb challenge we've got all the exciting things to get our children away from the street I always say a kid in sport is a kid out of court that is our motto you know that's going to be the let's play centers of excellence we are back we're going to change the pH of sport in this country but we want to start with the children that's why we have the mou in our department we've put together 69 million which which is going to buy equipment for Rural school children for poor schools it can be that that it's only the private schools that has all the sporting equipment none of the black people sitting here or the CED people or the Indian people for that matter had po vating at his school none of you but PO vaing is the Olympic sport there's a new Olympic sport called wall climbing I the private schools now have walked clim me our children in the less fortunate schools don't have that it's my job as the minister of sport not to complain but to make sure I make sure that what is in the private schools as in the schools of our children that is not so privileged and we should not be moaned the fact that the private schools have it we must learn from them and we must emulate what they are doing so much in sou people like to criticize people that they should learn from as the minister waza got a silver medal at Olympics he got two gold medals because curo was looking after his career we need to go to curu and say what you did with waza do it for the child in M plain for the child in Gulu for the child in that's what we want to do so theou will never gather dust under my leadership we are going to bring expression to what we've agreed upon and if you don't believe me the the ambassador of France I want to quote him so he can say no I'm not telling the truth when I was a minister he sent me a text message he's like Minister we've been trying to sign theou Minister can you help I said uh can we meet tomorrow morning and sign he says oh I'm out of the country I said so you are the problem and after a month after changing some new things I changed there we signed and he stood up at the press conference he said I must tell you this ministry is the fastest Ministry I've ever worked with these are action men I said didn't didn't hear you repeat that again so that is what we're going to do with the same thing then you know government we must listen to people and the gnu is that type of a government I was at Fame week I met three little girls they were my protectors told me you have to leave it's becoming too dangerous everybody's grabbing me and want a picture and when they were pulling me out this girl is pulling my jacket and I'm like thinking I'm not going to leave you I said how can I help you just like 30 seconds and three I said let him come let him come the three ladies came they spoke all three of them spoke at one time and all I could hear is that our movie house in khicha is closed because we don't have a screen that's work working we don't have proper speakers our computers are old I said I will be there within a week when I turned around said why we'll never see him again and they saw me and I went to go look at the screen it wasn't working properly I went to look at the speakers I went to the library when I saw the computers I realized those were the computers that we used to steal before I went to jail those type of that's how old those computers were I can tell you today myself and the deputy Minister on Monday for on Monday we took them the money they are putting a new screen new speakers and new computers in that score 10 students in Mitchell pling got bseries to study music after studying music those 10 kids you can change she's coming here you see I learned quick in government they change I never knew that on TV so I'm thinking these people the esteemed people when they go to the gym they must do this training because the whole time so the Mitchell Spain the Mitchell Spain these people got bseries and when they graduated they went back to the to the townships in M PL and kala and Del and they started to teach other kids music they will go from suburb from Flats to Flats to Flats to Flats to Flats getting people music teaching people how to play music and they will do one one can I get uh TI please can and they will do one one instrument and children will be away from The Gangs to go and teach music it gives me great joy that I then when they met me I made sure that we speak to B way and the department and we said we'll match them rent for r what they gave they gave equipment for 2 million for 1 million rent and the department put another 1 million rent for equipment thank you for equipment for the kids now they can teach 400 students and keep them away from crime so they can teach music when I became the minister uh I saw the list of people going to Venezuela I said where are the disabled people on this list I cut the officials I said let's replace them with disabled and let's have all the racers here you can't just have black people going this country is not only black people it's all of us and I changed that and I removed some officials and they went to the Venezuela fair and the people of Venezuela came to myself to myself and the minister Deputy Minister and they said South Africa was one of the best participants in the Venezuela book fair so much so that the Cuban uh uh government is inviting us to be the main guest next year at a Cuban Book Festival and it's going to be transparent we are going to have everybody that wants to go with the government to Cuba they must apply so we do things a bit differently and more transparently I have shown people that you have nothing to height so very soon look out for the authors that were to go and Showcase in in Cuba the government will pay for this thank you very much we have seen boxing you know the first black man to earn 100,000 in sport was Peter teram mbula Peter teram Mula was the first black man to earn 100,000 in Sport price money which he had to share with the coaches and but Peter Tera 40 years after Peter Tera boxers are earning 4,000 r a month a fight 4,000 rents to get brain damage but when you look at the officials there officials that fly twice a week renting expensive cars running up phone bills of 120,000 that we said is not going to happen so we've appointed the acting caka from my office to oversee we have stopped all this legal they are not in the business of boxing the boxing essay was in the business of legal issues they stay in court they have lawyers on retainer I've stopped all the legal matters we've settled the legal matters we are now putting boxing back to where you belong the advert is out you can you you can also apply if you have boxing expertise and you can add to the board the it is now being advertised knowing how to fight is not the only requirement you must be able to have this one is very personal to me I grew up with spinning I and I saw what spinning does there's no gangsters in that spot there's no drug users in that spot because every s they have they buy oil screws seats Tires Tires are expensive for aspers and I can tell you when I went to prison and I came out spinning was still at the same place unrecognized being called the gangster sport people that don't do spinning don't see the value of it so much so when I became the minister the first priority for me was spinning and they Tau the white people thought I'm talking about spinning top in the gym the things they do there and the some of the super colorss were laughing at me like why is he doing this gangster sport I can tell you spinning I've been to an empty rugby game empty soccer game empty kick game I've never been to empty spinning and I said this will be my priority I first had to teach my staff from the ad through to everyone about spinning and I remember the Deputy Minister said she's got to go I still I'm still waiting to see that go and and I worked very hard to formalize spinning spinning I met with Motorsport South Africa they came with their problems to me and I said before I listen to your problems fix my problem you must legalize spinning and they assured me they will do that I went to meet with the president of the fia the highest decision making person when it comes to anything with an engine from F1 to GP to spinning everything he didn't even know what spinning was I had to he asked me for send me two or three videos I send him 35 videos I think he might have blocked me after that and I'm it's very I'm very proud today to say spinning is going professional Spinners will get a salary and we we are the Federation is even now getting sponsorship they are going to buy cars for the children that parents can't afford the GES so DM you better come clean very quickly if you have a Gess if you don't you must also apply for a vehicle to spin there and I want

you have to attend cabinet you have to attend cabinet committees you have to attend the portfolio committee I was called by President Raposa and he asked me minister Kenzie come see me and I thought I'm in trouble and he said how are you holding up I said Minister uh president do you want me to give you the answer I'll give to you or the one I'll give to my friends at home he says give me the one of your friends at home I said president I've underestimated the workload of ministers number two in 2022 I said ministers are getting paid too much money I withraw that was immediate effect and I want to say to you that the gnu is the second chance that we've been given do not underestimate what the voters has given us as Government we work very nicely together you know John Ste and myself used to insult each other every election and we're still going to insult each other but I remember I was wearing a t-shirt and I passed one of his Ries and he said there goes that green gangster and we used to insult each other last week on Wednesday the president was busy speaking in cabinet he was seated next to me and I see this man he's busy under the table and I get annoyed like what are you busy with and when I put my hat back I saw he's eating bong and I said and he looked at me and he says and he put in and before I ate for reasons I'm not going to mention here I wanted him to eat first and when he ate I ate and I think I finished 60% of the bulog he took 40% I said hey come to be the minister of Agriculture so uh I want to assure s Africans that the gnu is working it is the president went to the USA he was over subscribed with meetings the deputy president went to UK he was over subscribed meetings and to everybody that's here we are going to make sure that sou Africa becomes one of the best countries again and we take our rightful place in and the ones that say the gnu is not working they already divorced and fighting while we are still intact we are going to build and I want to thank my Deputy Minister I want to thank the president for finding me worthy and this is what I've managed to do in 30 days in in uh 100 days and what our next year we are in fire

secret because we were keeping it as an ace up our sleeves to say that we will have some one-on ones later on but will have take the hands at the moment we have four hands sis at the back the RO mic I have the mic but I had not take this mic also press media 24 um during the ministers media briefing of edsv delicious I had said um how are we as media going to go back to artists and sports stars and sports professionals to say to them look minister mcken is not the same as previous ministers who would only make promises and not deliver um how are we as media going to say that to artists and sports practitioners if our own um promises that the minister has made to us have not been kept we we the City Press team has been we've been trying to get um a one-on-one with the minister since before the day of the the days of the Olympics we were told that um this would happen when the minister came back from Olympics it didn't happen um it took a while and then we eventually managed to speak to The Minister's team at the DStv delicious to sayti can we please request this because we understand that the minister is going to be doing a media briefing with everybody but we wanted to do it differently because we also wanted the interviewed to be the there's a particular way that we wanted to do the interview which would not um be served if we did it in this kind of a setting so this has still not happened and now when the minister says to the to the public that they must not listen to Media practitioners that have not spoken to the minister they must must only listen to the practitioners who have spoken to the minister who are those people because we have been begging for a meeting with the minister for more than two months but it hasn't happened so then I'm I'm just I'm trying to understand what it means when you say don't speak to the people who haven't spoken to me because there seems to be if I can go ahead and just call it gatekeeping with the minister is concerned thank you um thank you very much please in uce yourself the name and then the media house uh good uh good afternoon everyone Benjamin Leu from new room Africa uh Minister just two points from your first two points that you um addressed the elephant in the room um you say there there was nothing abnormal about your trip to to to Paris but is there any way you believe uh there could have the expenditure could have been reduced in line with your cost cutting policies uh since coming into office and and you said you should not be compared to to Mama Joy but um uh fan Super Fan expenditure was also normalized in in previous Administrations uh do you think that something that's made normal also under your Administration in terms of uh expenditure for the minister could be uh changed as well like I said in line with your policies of cost cutting and also um there's there's push back from the big unions you spoke about the the private Equity deal potential deal between SB and AI Sports Group there's there uh push back from the major unions the sharks lions Western Province and uh I think the Bulls have you heard from them um as to what their concerns are with regards to this deal and and where do you stand with regards to that commercial arm a stake in the in the in the spring box or saay rugby Flagship brand being sold to that particular company thank you uh please give it to Tommy uh thank you very much Tommy from creative talks uh my question Minister there are policies that have been adopted by Parliament but the department has been very quiet about them one is uh the revised white paper that was adopted in 2022 the second one is theater and dance policy uh that was adopted but uh DC has not communicated with the set in terms of implementation and how to do that is there any plans uh from your side about that thanks thank you the last hand for now is the back um good morning uh Minister you to the Ethics Committee for um quote unquote the the abuse of State funds and state res sources of course this is in connection with your trip to France what do you make of the eff referring you to the Ethics Committee are you faced by uh the referral secondly um of course you're reflecting on your first 100 days in office you know people have opposing views on um your first 100 days in office some believe that you're too excited to be a minister um um and we've heard some saying that you are answering too much to Twitter I mean even this issue of the the France issue you were putting everything out on social media firstly um don't you think perhaps that maybe you should put down the phone a little bit and not answer to Twitter as you do answer and secondly I also want to know what do you make of people saying you are too excited is do you see it as a mistake or do you think that's exactly how you should be thank you uh thank you very much Minister uh can I answer the first FL I think the issue of of uh s press I thank you for the question but I also think that when I went to delicious I made time to speak to yourself while I was there so it's not that you didn't see me but seeing that you have questioned the staff in my office it was my instruction not to see any media when I was referring that they mustn't listen to me that is not spoken to me I even went further the part that you omitted I said these are the media you should listen to that's here today so you are here today they must listen to you then I can assure you that if you want to see me tomorrow we can make time before this weekend and I will give you that one-on-one thank you very much the second from Newsroom saying that I say there's nothing abnormal I want you to I want us to don't do word play there's a m mysterial handbook that guides what ministers should and should not do I have done absolutely nothing I didn't even know what car awaits me when I got there I didn't even know who will find me there I didn't even know how do things work I'm not the first minister to fly I'm not the last Minister show me where have I done wrong because the ministerial hand book does not guide Mama Joy it guides me that's my so I've done nothing wrong there so I will not fall in the Trap that the deer is laying for me you want to prevent me from going outside and go and do my work I will not do that I'm going to do the work to the the best of my ability I'm not these ministers that get cowed now must now change you know I'll make you example and I want to be clear on this issue they took me to meet with the the the president and the and the ministers from countries were at the house in Paris where we were addressed by the police Minister when we got there they wanted on the car they wanted the sticker that say you should be there the driver said no Minister minister they said no no no sticker Mar had to go and take a sticker out of her bag which he had he said go back put sticker and come now imagine if I rocked up there was a uber let's just be practical you know it's nice to talk and say you're wasting money but the facts of the matter is that when I get get there I'm being told Minister you going to this this site of parents now now I'm a scholer uber then everybody else is there for Olympics is calling a uber and then they cancel my trip if I miss the engagement you're still going to fight with me he went on a joy ride he didn't go to the meeting you know uh there's something that the DM taught me she taught me something when I became a minister is yeah yeah what that means it's one of the most powerful lessons I learned in life they say when you have the king's when you see the king's Kettle roaming the street if you don't take that kettle back you are in trouble and if you take the kettle back and they caught you with a skettle on the way taking it back you must say what are you doing with a king skettle the rules is not written by gon McKenzie of traveling I don't sit with a laptop and book a flight pre becoming a mayor a minister I've never booked my own flight I've got people doing that for me so I can't come here and plead guilty to something for rules that have not set up I can promise you if all the ministers can give their traveling expenses you have you are not saying hey you actually saved money by not staying another 19 days I came back the president approved my travel what is the problem of the eff the problem with the E is because they are not the minister I am living what they've been fighting for for so long they were insulting me called me my Bandit now they must say honorable it is hurtful I understand and that hurt sometimes find expression in nonsensical answers that they talk about me or questions I do believe that the cost was put up by the demand of cars in the the Olympics the demand of hotels I went on my own cost cutting my children went to Dubai September last year go check which hotel they stated go check which hotel my kids they did go check what we flew going there then you'll understand this excitement you're talking about I'm not excited for perks this is a downgrade for me I am not this ministers that will that is that will be told blue lights excite me when we got new cars as a minister and you and you you guys will make accusations but you don't be answered when you put me in the BMW in the mercedesbenz I jumped at the union buildings or where I got my car I jumped out of a more expensive personal car to go into the government car so I can't be excited I'm here because this is a labor of love for me that's what excites me that I can change people's lives it's true I'm excited to be a minister because I've got the power now I fought I walked in the rain people walked in the snow in the in the in the storms for me to be a minister the prea people fought very hard for me to be there I'm excited imagine the the people that was voting for that walked so that their lives can become better and then when they got the opportunity to go into the gnu the leader said Haru no I can't do that to people people put wanted me to get power I now have power to change lives so this thing of exciting I want to kill it right here I have never booked my own flights I have people booking my flights this thing of ministers I have to now behave within the mysterial handbook I asked the AVG what is the mysterial handbook saying she says you can't do that I was flying business I was flying to Cape Town my first flight I was sitting in economy class because the adg told me the ministerial handbook wants me to fly economy class and I found other Minister sitting in business class and I went to peace I said why are me and you sitting in economy class the other minister sit there she said no it is their miles they've been ministers for long so they accumulated miles and they're using their miles I said oh okay so I'm not excited number one for these things that they think is perk staying in a hotel it's my first time being abroad staying in hotel that's not five star I'm not excited for those sticks I'm not even this car they got me that Mercedes I will never drive that car yet home in my own life so I'm not excited for those number two and lastly the issue where they say they took me to the Ethics Committee it's their right they can take me wherever they want to take me it's their right e needs to be relevant and gon McKenzie is now the most relevant name at the moment in this country if they talk about malma people don't listen so they have to talk about gon and malma so he can get the shine that I'm experiencing now that's the truth they talk get they are getting crazy they're obsessed with me and I enjoy that because I'm a minister so in the last question of the white paper uh Al who's coming to new's question the issue of the push back from the unions my job as the Pres as the minister is to listen to people the reason why I asked for a postponement I didn't demand the postponement I asked for a postponement which was granted was to listen to what the unions are complaining about before December I will be able to answer this question to say what is it the unions are complaining about your question what do I think of the deal I I can tell you if I had to do the deal the rugby deal myself I would have pushed for more terms for the from our side I would have done a different deal but we are different I don't know I'm not a rugby at Bator so number one of your question I'm going to hear what the complaints are number two of your questions I just think that we can push to get more All Blacks did the same deal and they got more money so I think that ech maybe they must push them for more money but you know I'm just glad that there's foreign direct investment in the country also that people believe in our country to invest 1.3 billion but now let's hear what the union say and let's Implement for the person that says I must put my foot my phone down let me answer you very nicely of 702 before I was a minister we have in the PA which is called come up come up every PA member knows what it is it is me speaking you want me to put my phone down so you can lie about me now I'm on on my phone so people can hear first and did daily Maverick wrote an article and say I walk around carrying a gun I don't have a gun I'm not allowed to carry a gun now I can answer and say you talk nonsense they say I spent I was having a joy right it is my phone that makes me defend myself if the president called me today and say put your phone down or you no longer Minister I will not put my phone down I will resign and thank him for the opportunity because I'm not going to be a forever Minister I'm not going to make this post change me I still want to be G that people know out there this thing will not make me mat I don't take a salary I in fact today I so I got a salary I said I'm going to buy 100 tickets how many tickets I said B 200 tickets now when I look at my salary I think mati is such a great artist I am now tomorrow morning 9:00 I'm going to give tickets away because I'm no longer buying 200 tickets for the mati concert I'm now buying 600 tickets for mati's concert 9:00 on my phone even if you want a ticket you check me there on my phone upgrade to give thing then cuz people lie they lie about you and Twitter has given me opportunity to refute the lies the people that believe in me when there's a story about me you know what they say let's wait for the minister to answer then we will know the truth I will never put my phone down and you mentioned that people say I'm too excited you know my first job in life honest job let me put it that way my first honest job in life was cleaning the toilets in prison that was my first job that was the first honest job I got to clean the toilets in prison and the corridor of the executive ask everyone I see one or two people here the cover from Jil ask them there's Houston and them I would sing there in the corridor I would be friendly I'll be making jokes those people there they would be like why you always in such a good mood it's not a ministerial post that make me happy I Am Naturally not a miserable person I a happy person not because of the job I Am Naturally happy I'm the leader of the PA I'm happy ask the people last night I was talking to people we make jokes ask my guys that has been guarding me we make jokes all the time when the judge was swearing me in wondo I was making jokes this is who I am I am happy to be alive not to be a minister do you know my k has asked me to resign because they say a he's so tired why don't you just leave this monality we always see you in the news so I'm not excited for The Minister's post I'm excited for being able to serve South Africans that's what I'm excited for and I will be reshuffled one day I'm not those people that think I'll will not be reshuffled and when I get reshuffled you will still find me in the street being happy if I can be happy in a prison cell I was the Joker in jail if I can be happy in a prison cell how can I be set in cabinet all that white paper you know we are busy with negotiations with the lottery and everybody to help the Arts more substantively to talk to corporates we have just spoken we are talking to R&B Bank we are talking to different people behind the the sins we can't really talk much about that because the negotiations are still ongoing and we are talking to multichoice we are talking to them to say how can you help us multichoice came back and say this is how we can uplift the creatives but those discussions are still ongoing the white paper as I've mentioned here we are going through all of the things because there's some things there take it from a creative take it from a bestselling order that I just think is exploitation how some of these things were agreed upon now I don't want to bury artists with no money I just want to go and pay my respects at the funeral not going and pay for the funeral so I promise you very soon with all the sectors we are going to sit with them and ask them can we change here can we change here can we change here artists are one part of the conversation we the people that is been put starts of Arts in this country it's a second part of the conversation a third part of the conversation is the corporates a fourth part of the conversation are the people that the that we are performing for so you can't just have one view The Minister's view you must listen to all the views so the different papers that are there I don't want to sign a paper which I've not read because it will be happened under my watch imagine if if if the papers get signed and there's something that's exploitive to artist how will I defend something while I'm the minister like the one of fair use I'm fighting that thing it's in the papers that that people want me to sign I will never agree to fair use because fair use say you can't set a price to your music you can set a price to your art we can't have that so all I'm asking is for a little bit more patience as you can see the 100 days we were very busy but we are going to sort it out we are serious about this job we are excited to deliver to we have higher Ambitions some of us imagine if we can't even run this department tomorrow how can we say no we want to go higher than being a minister we can't so I want to be successful in this department I want to deliver cuz people are looking at me more than they look at any other minister so I can't be setting my foot wrong I need to check and recheck thank you very much um thank you very much Minister we'll take another round of hands uh can I ask that uh we stop at coras chief minister and DM are allowing us so that we can go for lunch Minister did promise that he is available after this so he can talk to the media so I'll start vest and then the three hands in the front and then the last hand so this time we're taking five six hands and that will be it because we have to be done by Gast and Minister and DM will be available after this uh good afternoon Shannon Mar Cassi broadcasting Africa all protocol observed Minister um technically uh the president always say that the ENC made a good move to start the gnu so for me I want to say you did a good move to be a minister right so that was a good technical move Mo Kenny Kun is in city of jot you have a MMC in Kang so technically you've done the Right Moves however your department has failed one to communicate with the media when we want interviews it's not just uh some most of us have the same problem and we talk because we are colleagues to get interviews with you is a problem secondly H you know you your your department fell in a trap you 100 years in 100 days in the department your officials are more than 100 days in the department they have failed this Paris issue is not an issue the Rand dollar naira exchange the department should have answered it that way in South Africa let's say it's a million Rand in uh Euros it's 500,000 EUR in naira you spent 9 billion yeah no NAA naira it's 9 billion so your your department has failed to use the Rand dollar exchange to answer and the media capitalize on that say no but you didn't stay in senton and you pay that amount you were overseas and so on the second part your department had the boss Barat where they called all media people and all that not entertainment people and all that we came there the second day by force here's the thing you are not the president of the colors but in that room there was not even two colors there's more colors in this room today than in that room of artist media and so on which is something your department failed because they send out those invites thirdly and last I'll I'll come back for gossip later the koan you had a meeting with the koan not as a PO president as a minister now the ministerial handbook says when a minister calls a meeting there must be food there must be a accomodation there must be transport the department didn't provide that for the co and you are minister so they failed because now it looks like they have discrimination against the the co all ministers we attend this event you were with us at be tell there's food and all that why did the koan not get food transport gaing for that meeting um let me end by this there is a major issue you are you are saying the right thing but you are talking of multichoice super bats better way you're all talking of white Monopoly capitalist but there is a fight in the media industry and the entertainment industry for black owners to get into the space like the school sports uh is a good initiative but now when you give it to multichoice and DStv we sitting thinking but they have PSL they have rugby so why couldn't you look at small black owner media houses on thank you my a time is done can we have the we have the three hands in the front yeah thank you so much my name is from UFM Minister congratulations on your appointment I see you like the the job I would imagine it it's a fantastic position H I want to find out before proceeding because this is a something that makes me and other colleagues uncomfortable that going forward are we going to be having a squad of cheerleaders in every press briefing of the department like this because it's not consistent with how we deal with government as media I shouldn't have people that are pleased or not pleased with my questions H it's simply not comfortable and then H Minister this present stories are we ever going to see an end to them uh there's a section of society can I proceed peacefully here please yes there's a section of society that really disapproves of them and I'll explain why they saying that H the minister seems to come across as suggesting that there's no credentials to him he only known for being a jail bed it can send a wrong message in a country where we already have serious H levels of crime that H young men could be misled into believing that they need to be initiated and in prison in order to end their strides in society is that going still going to be the approach going forward thank you please pass the the mic two questions per person please name and media house all right thank you very much my name is Sanda from the Sunday Times two questions for you Minister regarding the controversial um Olympics trip that has gained a lot of traction and questions around it we've noticed that there are material discrepancies in the communication that you've posted um firstly the letter that you've written to the department seeking Clarity uh around the cost breakdown is dated the 15th of October 2024 while the response from the Department is dated 5 days before that which is the 10th of October so was this human error please can you kindly explain that that um discrepancy secondly uh when the deputy Minister was presenting she spoke of plans to upgrade and refurbish dilapidated Sports infrastructure that have been neglected over the years um we've come to understand that in certain cases um there are tenders that have been um issued out to service providers to build or or or fix um these sports facilities across the country now before the department spends more money will there be a fact finding Mission and investigation of sorts uh to figure out or find or follow the money Trail rather to find out who are these service providers that have been tasked with these projects but have not been delivered and will we be seeing um maybe the the the department pursuing criminal charges against this corruption that has seemingly been um um done thank you very much and next okay thank you very much program director my name is Good Hope Lea I'm from West Side ofm uh in the West Rand uh Minister and Deputy Minister thank you very much uh for the 100 days for your contribution uh well my question will sound more even of a comment uh our radio station happens to be one of uh the community radios that support uh spinning we've got we've been promoting spinning we've been we we we have an annual event that we've been hosting for the past 8 years it's called the event is called the Freedom Day SP in firstest it happens every year on the 27th of April uh Minister uh we've been following your journey especially uh throughout the spinning fraternity uh you formalizing and we want to thank you uh for uh taking you know h a stand and making sure that a proudly South African sport uh it's uh formalized it gets sponsors we appreciate you and we respect you for that but there's just uh something that we want to highlight because we've been following all your Journeys uh all the events that have been hosted others uh you know in your name obviously honoring your contribution and also the galad Dina that took uh place in Cape Town uh the I want to understand why is there no inclusion of other provinces uh within because we feel that and I don't like using this word but uh you'll excuse me for using this because that's what uh you know uh that's how it seems you know to say uh is this thing for the colard community only or is it for everyone because growing up in the spinning uh fraternity uh we grew up you know colored black Indians even whites you you know we grew up as one and uh we feel that uh Minister as much as we love the work that you are doing in our industry kindly include everyone uh uh to be included all provinces uh do normal procedures of uh you know doing consultation so that everyone uh becomes uh included and lastly uh I'm part of the uh the national Community radio forum and Minister uh we we from the community media fraternity we would be very very much Happy uh as much as I heard you talking about the policy on uh uh copyright of musicians we've got serious challenges we are Community media sector it's um it's a a we are we are the one developing uh artist making sure that artists get more a time from the community media sector and there are serious challenges that as a community media fraternity would H want to engage with your department because we believe that uh you can help resolve issues especially with your samro and your uh I forgot the other one uh that collects uh royalties who would want to engage uh the minister the department and you know to resolve issues uh around it thank you thank you the last two hands one at the uh no that one at the back and then the other one right at the back and that will be the those will be the last two hands he's got the mic already at the back oh sorry thanks froma maybe the first question um is in terms of your involvement with all the different federations and also with the individual athletes do you have a benchmark in terms of when for sport when you get involved in an issue because we saw you get involved for example with L when he didn't go to the um Paris Olympics but there was an athlete for the Paris uh Paro Olympics who didn't get picked and he felt he needed to get picked and we've seen issues with swimming and some of their swimmers as well so and we've seen you sort of get involved in some of these things so is there and it seems a little bit ad hoc so is there sort of a benchmark where you get involved and do you not risk run the risk of just sort of being all over the place really in terms of when you do and don't get involved in sort of these sporting disputes also these disputes happen a lot so that's why I'm asking is there a benchmark would you just sort of get involved as and when it does um come up and then the um other question is um I know you signed the school support umou with the Department of um basic education there's been been anou that's been signed before school sport has been a conversation that's been going on we've done the court handovers we've done the kid handovers we've done all of these sorts of things but if you've had this mou if there was anou in 2018 between the former ministers um if other ministers have been speaking about this thing clearly there's something that's gone missing and maybe an admission on your part that something is going wrong um and has gone wrong in the past so what exactly is so different about what you've signed now um and what are the timelines so that we not here in 2027 or 2028 with new ministers and they are saying oh look at us we signing a new mou we've been here before thank you very much the last hand right right right at the back okay um it's mahudi Mulo from Sac news um Minister firstly I would like to say we do see your effort and we are very impressive of the work that you've done so far and I still remember how it was watching uh rugby match um on sabc and what it has done to the people back at home um just out of cuity and also a followup question I remember the last time we were at netball essay um we were with the president of uh netb Cecilia mulani and she did mention that um the 2 million that they get from the Department of sports arts and culture it's it's like a drop in the ocean and also um judging from the sponsorship that they do get um when you compare it's it's not enough and she also mentioned the netball Cod not being uh built in I think it was in limoo I stand to be corrected um just a follow-up question of any developments on that and going forward how that is going to be you know done um thank you very much much I think I will give Minister and DM an opportunity to answer as I've said that this is the last round uh but Minister and DM have promised that they are going to be here so after lunch we still have an opportunity to talk to them Minister DM well thank you I the question that was been asked uh about the issue of the letter and the date I'll give the person that I wrote to she said next to me uh adg ctia kobala thank you uh Minister and um good afternoon to everyone um the minister wrote to us um yesterday on the 16th um of October we responded on the same day the 10 at the bottom of the letter was a a typo but if you look at the signature date um in the letter it does reflect when the the letter was was actually uh compiled and forwarded and responded to thank you very much and then I'll give over to the deputy Minister thank you very much uh Minister um thank you very much um Sanda a very important question indeed just to mention that um few days ago I had a meeting with the sports infrastructure and Facilities Management and we were preparing for the ceremony in Pani for sport facilities that were built in 2002 to be handed over and there was a request of almost 500,000 to do some um refurbishment and fix few broken things that were there but when I looked at the pictures the infrastructure looked quite very well and uh the only thing that needed to be done there was just to clean the facility and uh I refused that we should refurbish any facility that was built in the last 5 years and we reflected on the policy and the policy of the department says that a facility will have 15 years warranty unless there is a poor workman's um problems that are there so if there's no poor workmanship there is no way that we can go back and spend money in that the money that wased for that um project it is now going to ulundi where there is no sporting facilities at all for a community that is more than 8,000 in population Minister and only one high school that is in that community so we won't be fixing communities must look after the facilities after 15 years that is when we can come and do some thank you very much thank you very much I'm just going to go quickly through the answers the one where the where they say the officials failed uh uh to talk about naira and Euros the question was not asked by the to the officials it was asked by the minister if the officials answered they would have told them we didn't ask you they asked me I asked the officials this is the lady next to me I wrote a letter to she's just giv an explanation I saw also the typo but then I went to the stem and I saw so there was no failure if I'm the minister I must account so when they ask me a question I must account then the issue that you talk about not they not being cols that's not entirely correct because in which explain I remember there's a group of musicians that was flown down CU I know because I was with them in the flight I think it was like 12 of them some even from the M Music Academy so maybe where you were standing outside you just saw two colors but it was really more colors there than two and the issue where you say we didn't give food transport to the coons for the meeting that's also not correct because the meeting is only on Saturday which is this Saturday coming and I know I signed off on the transport I signed off on the food I signed off on that so that meeting has not happened yet it's still going to happen and the last one I don't subscribe to the thinking the bad ways and the multi choices they give us money for Sports Development now you want me to go and take money from emerging companies they don't even sometimes have money to cover their overheads so why must I now still go and burden them they are struggling I must ask them for money I go to the corporates that I established and white Monopoly capital and those that's not how my thinking works I am myself a capitalist with a social outlook on life so we go to people they give us money the question here to say will there always be cheerleaders pres present today is not a normal press conference it's a press conference where I come and account to the South African nation and to the people that put my name forward to become a minister so I must account to them so it will not always be cheerleaders then the second question you also ask about the jail bird don't I have other credentials you particular said in meetings of e press conferences why didn't you ask them why they keep on referring to me as a jail butt so you want me to be silent while you are also silent like you you never ask me you said there you must ask them why do you keep on refer once they say abanded and I say nothing which means I agree to the label so you must start that question then you say people will look at it my brother we don't come from the same communities you see in my community gangsterism is r in my community tomorrow more than 10 people are going to die because of gang wars and they think in my communities gangsters are being idolized in my communities a young kid grow up and he wants to be a gangster in my our community a child that is in conflict with the law at the age of 10 think he doesn't have a future and he needs a gate mey that has been in conflict with the law to see that there's another way making one mistake you're not condemned to the dban of being a gangster for the rest of your life in prison families of prisoners are using my name when they tell their children to change to say look at G McKenzie you can turn your life around I can't change my past but I can change my future and me mentioning I was inj and I'm not proud of it but I want to show people that you can make a mistake and become better you don't need to remain who you used to be and if I go to eldos to MCH sping to gendale in our communities people see me there and they happy and they see me as that it is possible that you can change your life so I don't mention jail because I like being referred to coming from jail that label has cost me a lot but I've got a duty to say you can change your life you can become better right then the issue of the the enca's question about where does it stop uh you see once you ask us for money Safa ask us for money s ask us for money uh suming s afca ask us for money I will never be a minister that's not allowed to speak where I give you money because that money belongs to the public so if they don't want money from us if they don't want us to talk they must not take our money cuz we are responsible to spend the money of the state wisely now when we give you money we call you and our interference will be we'll stop the money but we have developed a relationship where we are being listened to like with col Adams I just thought that he needs to be at the Olympics and we said we will pay for you but he was the one at the endend that said he's not going there if he doesn't run I didn't have the power to make him run by the power the power for him to go there and be part of the experience so there is where our power stops we have enough trust in the in some of the federations to know that they will take Sports to a great IDs but we are not going to be those people that see wrong things like let's take V South Africa needs V we are not a 10th world country we are the global South and as we are the global South Morocco Algeria Tunisia they all have uh V how come we don't have VR but we run the best league in Africa do you want our stadiums to be burned down by the supporters tomorrow do you want supporters to break the chairs there go and see orando Stadium today is a problem with chairs they need new chairs I mentioned that so that you must know that we must go with times we mustn't be too far behind the European countries that has v and we have a role to play as government in that one so yeah we don't have we do run the risk uh to not be interfering in the too much into the stuff but we know where to draw the line we ask if they don't want to we then don't give them money anymore but if they listen to us we continue to give the money then theou that is gathering dust during my speech here I said this mou will not gather the dust there's been previous mou signed there's been previous signed but this one will not gather dust I can already tell you that super sport and sabc is now going to show School spot on the channels that is the first it is derived from theou between myself and the department of basic education it is a GNU initiative it is the Minister of Minister uh Su it is Minister quube it's Minister McKenzie all three of us is responsible now that school spot is going to be shown on sabc and superport then the the issue of of of netball essay it Nal ESS is right that's too little money they need more money because netball is a sport that is very important and I agree with the president of netball sa we have to do better and we are going to do better 2 million is not enough for netball saay then the issue of uh the lack of of of of of uh uh the spinning that we spoke about you know uh uh my brother it's hard to be a minister in one press conference I'm being accused that there's no colets and the next question there's too many colors so I can't win my job is to keep the balance there's one spinner that is being considered the atlete by Red Bull he gets paid what see K and them are being paid because Red Bull and it's not a colored spinner it is Sam Sam Sam Sam is not a color but he's the number one spinner in this country at the moment that gets paid to spin by a corporate company I have given 1 million rent two months ago for spinning out of my pocket and we said they said what do you want to see I said I want to see all provinces being part of spinning that's all I wanted I didn't want to get involved I said I'm giving you the money but I want to see all provinces being involved I want you guys to have nine provinces the 100,000 will be for your hotel stay and your and your your your your petrol they've done that in seven provinces so far never have I seen white people being excluded or black people being excluded if you know of any case please let me know so I can immediately withraw my money because my money must not bring racism this is not a racist spot and then I want to thank you for the praise that you've given to myself and the DM I also would like to say that the issue the last issue that was spoken about here is about Sam we are busy with that we are busy with with samro we are busy with all those things and to everybody you know we are also still learning what is it people want us to do what bothers the South African public and we'll always answer your questions as the media I will be more available there was no time if I can tell you I've mered four birthdays of or three birthdays of my kids because since I'm being a minister I tell you the workload is insane I've never slept more than 5 hours we work day and night but we will make sure cuz the media is very important the people need to know I will be accessible even now if you want me I will remain behind and we can talk and to the people that came I want to say thank you for the people of my party that came I want to thank you also I specifically want to thank the people of Motorsport I saw you brought the car outside I was hoping it's a gift I'm just okaying and I want to thank uh uh the chief of staff mangu and the team in my office the DM staff stuff I want to thank them bongu and them but most importantly I also want to thank the people of desc take everyone because you guys never get the pra we get all the praise you guys are working so hard I've inherited the TM has inherited the best team ever and because I'm hungry you hungry thank you very much let's go have something to eat thank thank you very much the lunch is going to be served where we were having tea in the morning downstairs and then I think we'll give a minut DM about 30 minutes for them to eat and then and and taking the need the requests from the media that wants one on ones so if you could just go back to them and then we'll deal with the one on on after thank you very much lunch is downstairs e"
Qq13oX4mcRc,SAPS National Commissioner convenes a media briefing,2024-10-17T11:50:18Z,1913,photo there your phot why would you want to my e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e Min police me also acknowledge Min of police along with theut Minister as as the national commissioner without reing time ladies and gentlemen I will then call upon the minister to address us thank you very much uh Deputy ministers national commissioner we call this a a press briefing to update the nation on the recent developments on efforts to remove identified criminals particularly in the area of T District in E you would recall or tamb district is one of the two areas of forus um in the Eastern Cape in terms of reling communities of uh criminals the other one being but our key issue today is to focus on the arrests following the matter of 18 people in Lu C which is part ofah Hill and the C now before the 28th of September the date of this incident um the there were complaints in the community as we said before and grievances that before this incident there were a number of no cases that had not that had never been um uh completed and I do want to say that uh in relation to those cases whatever they are police are dealing with them they're investigating but uh in relation to those cases that occurred or that predated the 28th of September were 18 people who meted um there are three prominent arrests that were made and people brought to uh to courts um either because of illegal Firearms uh and I know that one other person um is accused of um mult Ms but um we are mentioning in that so that the community of Lu who we promised that we live we will leave no stone and tent and won't confine ourselves to the arrest related only to the 18th so that they get an update that police are dealing with those uh those cases and indeed they are and they've made success and progress which uh we are commending them for but um in relation to um the incident of the 18th in particular I will hand over to national commissioner so that he can give you a thorough briefing in terms of how they've gone about uh on the matters of 18 people and uh where they are as you talk as part of or as the main focus of this update today National Commission thank you very much Minister and good afternoon everyone uh with regard to the matter of the 18 people at luiki you would recall that uh there is a one suspect that uh or an Accused by now that appeared in court earlier uh this week OS and we have since after that arrested three suspects yesterday morning in uh in the early hours of the morning in pep and uh the three uh still uh will will still appear and we also arrested one in East London yesterday morning so uh in total then is four they will be appearing Court uh tomorrow but we also have uh one of the suspects that is still outstanding that is on the Run uh we were able to retrieve or confiscate his vehicle and uh that is how far we are with the investigation so in uh in total people currently uh arrested is five and of course uh one is still on the run and uh the investigation we cast it white so we are still looking at possibilities of linking other people to this specific case uh that is with regard to the sik siki and uh with the case of kumu that was stock theft related I'm sure you recall that uh after the Met of the six people we have uh since arrested one uh person and we are still looking for plus minus seven or eight suspects and uh the one person have since appeared in court uh that is a progress that we can give regarding the AG of the the case of the 18 uh people in thank you very much we have not yet recovered Firearms we are on track looking for the Firearms together with the one suspect that we are still on the run so we looking for you together with the FES that we used in the in the shooting thank you well outside of kumbo and Luc we do want to uh also update uh on the case of a policeman who was murdered in berin which is one of the small towns in our town where two suspects met the policemen out of work and they stripped him off his firearm and they killed him the police have followed up on the matter through investigations identified to one of the suspects and uh he then decided to fight police they fought back uh and they got neutralized um and they after the second second suspect it's important that we do so because that family um was deeply affected just like we were and we are that uh people should uh instead of um he was not even investigating and not even looking after them and we want to warn people even at the stage against attacking police whether they are at work or not at work if you do so you are attacking the state and there's there is never going to be any doubt that there will be consequences for that how long it takes is a different matter there will always be consequences when any citizen of the country attack police officers thank you thank you Minister thank you national commissioner um ladies and gentlemen we will open it up to questions um I would just like to ask you to state your name as well as the media house that you represent um and I think also um if you do have a question for either the minister or the national commissioner if you could just indicate as to whom your question is posed um just by a show of hands can I see if we do have questions so I see two hands I see three okay in that order we'll start number one number two number three number one and four thank you for the opportunity my name is Den Al I'm from from NK and the burg newspaper my question is to the minister and maybe the uh um Major General masim can answer as well um we've seen this trend now of kidnappings in in South Africa especially in the Eastern cave and then also this trend of mass shootings is this a concerning new trend in South Africa and is it starting to look like a crisis we should deal with um and if so what are the measurements being taken um is there a special unit that's been uh implemented or deployed to deal with this matter um yeah that's my question thank you question number two afternoon U my question is for the commissioner l p from Daily Sun um you spoke about uh the Firearms just in terms of uh measurements um how is sa planning to strength and gun control um in local and also work with local communities to prevent these mass shootings and then my second one is just any motive for the killings just yet okay can um sorry from the K Times newspaper um I just wanted to ask in regards with the I know um it was said that um Firearms have not been retrieved yet um I want to just get clarity what are the charges when they when they appearing tomorrow what are the charges uh they'll be appearing on and um also um if I may use this word positively linked how are they positively linked to the luiki murders if there's no firearms um that have been recovered yet and um lastly I just wanted to if maybe we can get an update cuz I know that there were um special team or national team that was was deployed in mtata um because there was a lot of extortion problems and now we know that we're approaching December um where areas like mtata are surrounded by a lot of uh villages and we see a lot of people who go back home and towns like inata get overpopulated because everyone is back at home and uh crime and things like extortion has been a problem so can I just get a indication maybe in terms of cuz we also know there were graduates maybe in terms of deployment inata or or let me say um are we going to see more police and I know also the commissioner in kumu spoke about um made some commitments about uh giving horses in terms of assisting patrollers can we just yeah get uh um uh more details about that assisting communities and what we'll see happening in this thank you thank you take the time hi I'm Abra the sabc minister in the yesterday's um portfolio committee you said that the country would be shocked to consider the fact that the massacre was coordinated from within Prison Walls and that you had spoken with your counterpart in Correctional Services Dr Peter Koval um can you just tell me where we are in terms of those conversations and how far we are because you said nobody's been arrested on that Point are you able to tell us what's happening there yet please let me start with kidnappings kidnappings uh and Deputy ministers would be free also to make a contribution uh a phenomenon that um is emerging in the country and is on the rise similarly we we are concerned about it just like all the citizens and uh I think there are different nuances in terms of uh how it comes about um we don't have all the time to unpack the whole of it because on the side you also hear of people arranging their own kidnappings but uh on on the on a more uh response is it's a phenomenon that is uh worrying us and um um we take Case by case not outside the strategy of uh organized crime is part of that but we take case cases as they come and so far I do want to say that police have been a successful uh it may take different days to kidnapping but those that have been brought to our attention police have successfully unraveled and arrested in most of the cases and and that's how we came to know that kidnappings and most of the time go hand in hand with uh drugs they go hand in hand with guns hand in hand with uh foreigners you would find one or two or three of those elements where there's kidnapping but U it continues to be um a crime that occupies us and we wanting to say to people in our country they must be alert they must uh be uh um uh on the alert that there are people um uh who are out there uh for for this for this crime mainly it's it's a people will kidnap and then demand ransoms and and all of that but police are equal to the task so far um it's not something that is a crisis but it is a concern uh of course now this yes we had a meeting with uh my colleague uh and the Ministries hope it was not just the two of us where we're discussing when do we put a ban a total ban and a stop to issues where police would uh there would be an incident police will investigate arrest take people through courts they get uh they found guilty and they get sentenced and they go to prison once in prison they start coordinating CRI crimes Minister kundal even mentioned a huge sum of money that they go as far as uh coordinating those monies uh per Mone money that you don't make in 10 years and so on but they would do that so we agreed in that meeting that they have to move on their side as correctional services and introduce new mechanisms through which they will be able to know make people who are in prison know that once you in prison you you are in prison it's no it's no place where you must think of even think of coordinating and all of that so so far they have access they get access to phones they get access to uh other individuals with whom they liar and commission of crimes and all of that we are um quite aware about that because it means that after the commission of another crime it means that police must then begin to to um investigate one small link that person arrest him or her for the second time so we were saying in case it happens in relation to Luc uh people must understand that it's in the context of what's happening in the country at the moment and uh um it's a phenomenon that we need to stop and can stop uh via Correctional Services um I think the buk of the questions can they be responded to by the national commiss uh thank you uh very much uh regarding the the question of uh gun control current legislation is quite adequate but we should remember that firearms that are also in the hands of uh individual private individuals at some point they become illegal as they get lost some get of course lost or robbed from law enforcement agencies then they become uh in become illegal motive we do not know at this stage you don't want to speculate uh but uh just have to wait for the process gets to court you will get the real motive as to what uh it was uh in terms of how they linked we do have various uh methods which we were able to link them uh and uh we can't disclose that uh as it will come out at court as to how we link them what I can give is that the vehicle that we confiscated was the crime scene that we we know for a effect but there are other ways that will come out at CT as to how we link them to the crimey and U in terms of uh deployment uh yes as we have launched uh the national festive season last week today we launch in the province of Western Cape uh remember what we are saying with the operation festive season is that we heighten policing in all areas we know that yes people will be going home going to holidays that's when will be heightening uh police visibility there has been a pass out in tata a week ago there was a pass out I think yesterday there is a pass out tomorrow also in various of our colleges those new uh constables will not be going on all days they will be joining to reinforce the current police that are deployed so there will be visibility in most areas uh commitment uh the commitments stand for the we are still busy with paperworks would make those horses at some point available but of course it not only be for them it will be uh more than one area in the in the Eastern Cape deploy those uh horses I think that is all well I just want to say that if you want to go home to you can go there uh it's it's quite safe you can go there thank you Minister um I have been advised that we do not have any questions from the virtual platforms okay there's a hand I see there's one question from the virtual platforms can you please please just are sending it reading okay so there's one question that comes from Marvin Adams Minister can you provide detailed information on the types of weapons used in recent mass shootings in South Africa specifically what can you tell us about the manufacturers of these weapons the prevalence of automatic weapons and whether any of these Firearms were formerly state-owned well I can't do that of hand but I would be willing to do that in the near future um but I got to that okay I see we have one last hand that I am going to take because we don't have questions from the virtual platforms the last two hands that I'm going to take um we can go first colle um I just need to know do we know In which court the um suspects will be appearing tomorrow and then Minister I just need Clarity please my understanding in the committee yesterday was that it is understood that the luiki siki shooting was coordinated from inside prison is that a fact or are you saying it could have been because you are seeing um this trend happening I just need to be sure on look we we we commissioner said he he doesn't want to uh speculates uh sometimes we get information and police get information but then there's always need to translate that into concrete evidence so so far we we we just listening what we are getting whatever it is there is a story like that uh but uh up until it gets confirmed and becomes a fact we will then be able to say once that has happened but in case it happens uh I'm saying it's important that we note this and there's something that we doing about it because you remember that the thir the one of the three people that I referred to earlier who are not necessarily directly linked to S is a Pari it said that is a paral which means that even parales are a danger and there's a need for us to review our parole system uh just one example is enough uh to send a message to the to to all of us in South Africa to say um so do we have all the criteria that we can voucher on to say when we say you are given parole you are no longer going to be uh dangerous u in the way that you were now this one proof is saying no uh I want to prove that I'm still dangerous as I was you arrested me I got I got charged whatever whatever I pulled my sentence through which was quite longish I'm back and I'm back on my old ways now it me means that uh and and and people look up to government and say so what what what sticks did you use what what uh measures what systems did use to assess this particular individual now that he has done this and and therefore it's a matter that uh is uper most in our in our minds that we should put an end to that including uh this one where coordination does uh get to happen while the person is in prison or supposed to be in prison thank you Minister um we'll take the last hand from where where the cases being heard tomorrow or they will appear City Court thank you okay s it's from enca I just want to find out in case maybe you've already spoken about this um just a breakdown of where all the suspects have been arrested and if so far um you know about their previous criminality and the last one um are expecting more arrest than yeah thanks we we do expect uh yes more arrest in the future uh we as I said we are having one that we are aware of that is on the run that we are looking for uh we can't say it will be the last one and as the minister say we are also looking somewhere in the correctional services we are also looking for further arrest in that regard at the correctional service and uh the ones that we arrested uh we well some of them are a previously committed crime uh you would know that the one that here at at this week he he did commit m in the past he he killed a policeman at luiki he was sentenced for life in in 2002 he was pared last year may and uh yeah that is his record what he he is the others will update you as we go along as then when theyve appeared because they appeared in court this one have appeared in cour thank you Ona and then we'll take the last hand from you uh I'm onip Fromm news I have two questions one is What charges do the luiki suspects face and the other one to the minister there have been cases of extortion reported here in Cape Town with one case in particular where eight police officers have been arrested in connection to extorting Chinese his owned businesses and hard FM spoke to one police detective who highlighted a concern of poor pay saying that many cops take bribes or Buckle to extortion due to poor pay are there any talks to improve police pay and detectives in particular given that they are at the Forefront of investigating serious crimes thank you take a lot of question commissioner I'm from UMBC mean is my name I want to hear um do you feel that like you have enough boots on the ground every other week e e e
yiFexnBJENs,GOLF | 2024 Fortress Invitational at the Glendower Golf Club,2024-10-17T11:44:16Z,199,"in the east of Johannesburg out at the Fortress Invitational it will be taking place right here at the Glen door golf club from today and it runs all the way until Sunday the 20th of October joining me now to talk about the Fortress Invitational and what we can look forward to and what to expect is Kyle deir who is currently in the Forefront and the leader for the Fortress Rookie of the Year Kyle a good morning to you thank you so much for joining us this morning let's speak about this tournament and what it brings because a lot of people say it's a good way to step into getting into International competition but it's more than that because it has also has a beautiful development element which you're currently leading at the moment Rookie of the Year looking at possibly walking away with 200k speak to me about the importance of this tournament from a golfer point of view yeah uh thank you for having me first of all and um yeah this is one of our Flagship events for the season Fortress has done a great job in um kind of elevating it and and making it one of the one of the events you look out for at the beginning of the year um yeah and I mean to have it at a venue like this as well I think is is is perfect um yeah and to be honest the uh The Fortress uh sponsorship of the event has kind of led to obviously the more TV time they've kind of brought a couple of the overseas players back as well uh so it's it it feels like a special event because uh The Field's stronger it's bigger uh the TV time at the end of the week into the weekend as well so uh yeah it really feels like major for us on the sunshine tour and it's a really special event and how important is that for you as a golfer to be able then to compete gain some of the best that the sports of golf has to offer yeah it's it's amazing I mean it's it's what you want to do you know we we practice long and hard hours to try and play against the best and compete against them so this week is a really good uh test for for all of us to compare ourselves against some of the bigger boys and um like you alluded to earlier it's it gives us an idea of what the level is uh internationally as well we speak of some of the bigger boys we look at the fact that there are previous winners here the likes of Williams the likes of mman um competing against you but let's speak specifically about you currently leading the way in terms of the Rookie of the Year how has that been for you and and how confident are you feeling that at the end of it all you'll be able to walk with away with that 200,000 yeah uh it's it's been um a crazy couple of months because uh the start of the Season wasn't that great I I really didn't start off very strong uh but I did a lot of good work with my coach and uh especially my psychologist to to kind of uh improve on certain things I wasn't in a great mental space at the beginning of the season so that work is slowly starting to pay dividends I feel and um the nice thing is I feel I'm I've still got a lot of room for improvement so I'm feeling very confident in my game moving forward giving you an opportunity to brag right now how big is that lead that you've got up at the top uh it's currently about 140 points but with the guys behind me I need a lot more points in the bank than that let's talk about the golf course itself out here at Glenn da dawa um how competitive or difficult would you say it is because you've been here before you've competed here last year how did you find the course itself uh it's one of my favorite courses in the country to be honest I think it's it's in the top three in in Johannesburg for sure as well uh it's it's quite tricky if you play well if you find Fairways especially uh the course does come to a little bit it it it can lead to a few birdies if you're hitting it well off the tea but uh if you're not on your game it'll about you so it's really good and for the people that are sitting at home and watching right now and just wondering how does a Young Cal debeer get into golf and and how was that Journey for you because you see a lot of parents just saying oh my child wants to become a a sportsman or Sports wom I'm not pro this unless they have some sort of Education behind them how was the journey for you and and what advice would you then give to a young Kyle sitting at home right now watching saying I also want to be a golfer I also want to potentially walk away with 200,000 for the Fortress Rookie of the Year um what's your advice to them and also to the parents sure so I mean I was very lucky my my family situation my parents they've always been very supportive of everything I've done uh so from an academic standpoint they always said you know you have to finish school you've got it there's no kind of pulling out of school to turn pro early or anything like that like some people have had the luxury of doing so um yeah they they were very supportive of every sport I played especially golf now uh they did obviously want some studies in the background so that that was done uh as soon as I was out of school but it was kind of just as as the backup plan to support the golf um and if I had to give any advice to any of the youngsters I think first and foremost make sure that you get your education uh I think a lot of guys just kind of dive into the pro world without uh any backup plan and golf is hard it it it'll it'll show you really quickly what you made of so I think having that little backup plan just gives you a sense of security going into uh playing professional golf and then it's not you know uh an All or Nothing thing when you pitch up yeah you know like this isn't your only option um and then also from a parental standpoint I've seen it go wrong quite often with some of the Juniors I think first and foremost just let your child play just step back and don't try not to get too involved uh I see a lot of parents get very involved and it it leads to especially in terms of the relationship between the parents and the child it often leads to issues so my main uh advice would be just let your child play and enjoy and as long as behaving okay and trying their best I don't think you can ask much more of them and lastly as I wrap up with you I am running out of time just a quick one just in terms of some of the challenges that you face as a golf I know it's not an inexpensive sport to get involved in without the right corporate Partners backing you up how has that been for you and how are you navigating those challenges um so I yeah I mean the sponsors and the support from from outside companies is is everything as a golfer I mean uh with a little bit of financial backing you can you can do a lot more than than some other guys who are going kind of week to week just trying to make it there uh financially so uh I haven't had the luxury yet of being with any major corporates or anything like that I'd love to partner with uh whoever I could at at this moment because like you said it's it's a very expensive sport but um yeah at the end of the day I think I'd like to think that most of us are not playing Just For The Money um so like I'm I'm playing as a as a passion uh you know it's what I want to do it's what I want to do for a living so that side overrules the the financial aspect which is why I'm still I'm still here even though the the finances haven't been the best over the last last year or two but um yeah I think the the sponsorship aspect of golf is massive and and the Partnerships could help every golfer develop their game well Kyle thank you so much for your time here this morning and good luck for the rest of the competition thank you very much thanks for having me that is of course Kyle deir out here at the Fortress Invitational he's currently leading the stands in terms of the Rookie of the Year and potentially at the end of the season stands a chance to walk away with 200,000 Rand"

PuPTL9c5hdM,RUGBY | Spotlight on Springbok deal - EFF's Nazier Paulsen,2024-10-17T11:33:09Z,977,sa rugby postponed a special general meeting that was meant to consider a proposal to sell a 20% stake this was in the commercial rights of the spring box to the American Sports investment firm Aki Sports Group now the postponement was made at the request of the sports Minister as you've heard there in that briefing gon McKenzie says that he needed more time you know to consult as well as allowing sa rugby time to fully brief him on the proposal so meanwhile the eff has expressed their disa approval of the deal e member of the Central Command team Nazir pson joins us now for more on the program thank you so much for your time Mr pson so first of all let's just get your immediate reaction uh to what the minister has just said first of all he says well going to these sporting events is his job what's your reaction well I think the minister has clear clear that up in Parliament he he's given conflict conflicting responses but uh I want to speak about the um sale of South African rugby and I just would like to tell the minister he's made a um FIFA has got nothing to do with rugby the world body governing body for rugby is the world rugby so it's it's not FIFA but over and above that um I want us to deal with the issue of um you know if if we want to um if we want uh you know a lot of people feel that rugby um and this was a negotiated settlement uh when uh they said that uh uh red Springbok rugby belong to the whites rugby doesn't belong to the whites it belongs to all South Africans and I think the bigger debate should be what should be the brand of of National Rugby and once we've got that brand sorted out we can see how that brand can be globalized um but uh you know so so in 2 in 2022 the New Zealand sold a 6% state in New Zealand Rugby and they kept all the commercial rights uh in rugby um they only sold a 6% state for uh 13 million us we are selling a 20 a 20% stake for 75 million us so there's a big difference uh for 6% they sold it for 75% more and we mustn't let we mustn't devalue um our brand or our sport this way it's a the the South African rugby brand is far bigger uh we've got uh um we need to fix up our our Grassroots uh rugby but I think um we need to focus on other on other matters first as opposed to looking for Equity Partners so there's a bigger debate to be had a a brand for South African rugby that will make it more amable to the majority of South Africans especially those who were denied opportunity to play Under The apartate Brand Springbok you know so the Springbok is one of those symbols along with the aparted flag along with the stem that should be done away with so we are going to be Unapologetic about that that the National Rugby should be rebranded long before we speak about looking for an equity partner if we want to globalize a brand we can't globalize an aparted brand which is a springb right we need to globalize a brand that is acceptable by the majority of South Africans most apart it uh but over and above that when when one looks at Mr if I may if I may also come in there Mr pson I mean I I'd also just have to ask you as to why you would refer to uh the sport as an apartate sport when we've seen uh what a unifying role the sport has actually played in South Africa in particular and I will actually rewind to that point where we also saw when the springbox came back with that win and they were doing their local four so maybe one might also put it to you and say no this is a sport that has actually unified South Africans more than anything but I want us to narrow it back to some of the bones of contention when it comes to this deal in particular what is the issue here with this deal well you know the the the with the deal we are selling the marketing we are selling the brand we are selling just about everything but over in above that if we look at the the makeup of the commercial rights company that will be set up to to to manage these Affairs the makeup public commercial rights com company is uh three people from saru and then a sports uh group has three people and the chairperson so they for 20% they will control this particular commercial rights company so the board will be seven people seven people three from saru and four from AI Sports Group which renders um them in complete control of of this particular company but what that company then controls is everything commercial so from branding broadcasting sponsorship events licensing related to rugby and uh whereas the New Zealand sold a 6% stake for 75% more than what we are selling or that what SAR was selling because we wouldn't sell our brand like that they're selling it the six% state and controlling all commercial rights all branding rights and I I just think that uh the saru are very poor negotiators when it comes to selling uh South African rugby I didn't say that rugby is an aparted sport I said the Springbok is an aparted symbol there difference we played rugby during a parate we played rugby after a part we love rugby before part we love rugby after a part the this the emblem the springb is an aparted emblem that's the difference I want us to make that distinction nothing wrong with the sport we love the sport all of us in the eff love rugby but we are saying the rugby emblem is an aparted emblem very big distinction that must not be conflated so also your party has accused the sa rugby of secrecy around this deal so why is the eff off the view that board members will get massive bonuses for clenching this deal well you know it seems that that even the minister himself has been aware of this deal and has not gone public with it if if this didn't come to light through the the member unions then we would not have known about it it would have happened in secrety the minister would have been away s would have been away none of us would have and when it comes to the minister everything is very dodgy with him all right let's wrap it up there I wish we had more time to further have this conversation there that is e member of the Central Command team Nazir pson joining us there thanks very much indeed for having this conversation with us for
aF9OGrqoTD4,Paris Olympics Trip | Do not compare me to Mama Joy: Gayton McKenzie,2024-10-17T11:27:45Z,7242,"so let me get the uncomfortable out of the way before I go into the good work that we've done you know I was in the news for spending money going to Paris past two days I had to answer being called a joy right now I don't understand when there's a sporting event I I first got very angry because they were comparing me to they said I remov Mama joy and I replac myself with her so I got angry at but then I realized being a government uh uh official you must be transparent you have taken on something that you can't get angry when people ask you about the money because every sent that we are using is belonging to the people now I was annoyed for for 10 minutes but when that realization came I realized that I must answer and I'm going to answer very transparently here and if there's any media person that still feel that I've not adequately answered please I will remain behind so that you can go back to The Newsroom having all your questions answered number one my first trip as a minister the first one as a minister not as a person as a minister was to the Olympics I came a week before the Olympics start I attended six different meetings I attended a meeting with the minister of aeran I attended a meeting with the African ministers I've attended the meeting with the Commonwealth ministers I've attended the opening ceremony I've also attended uh a meeting standing in for the minister of police where they had all the police there so I had six meetings I had to attend now before the opening ceremony the rugby already started for those that don't know so I went to go and watch the seventh rugby then when the Olympics started I sat in the rain so that our athletes also can have somebody screaming for them there and then I realized because I was so excited for this new job I have I want to learn I'm going to come back I'm probably the only minister in the world of sport that was not at the Olympics now where do you get the joy writing from so I want to make it very clear I came back not because I was forced to come back there was nothing wrong me being there now he's going to sporting events that's my job do you want me to go look at cabbages and the agriculture that is the job of Mr John steer isn't to look at the farms you can't that's my job to go to sporting events yeah especially the biggest showcasing of talent in the sporting World which is the Olympics I didn't go to the par Olympics and that's not an achievement not to go and I'm still going to go to all the sporting events because that's government now you want to portray me as a person that that's taking a joy right that thing you can do with other ministers you've chosen the wrong one because I am flying first class all the time with my own money and now I must fly business class so it's not a upgrade for me it's a downgrade locally i f like business class but as a minister you must fly economy class other day I was flying was my partner and she said ah can't we book you because my knees are so long cuz I can't sit now and then I must stand up so that I can but that's what the ministerial handbook demand of me it demands of me to fly business class to fly economy class locally I fly twice a week and I fly economy class internationally the mysterial handbook demands of me to fly business and not first class I'm mentioning this so that people can know I've not done anything outside the ministerial handbook I got there I saw them saying Mr McKenzie welcome welcome jumping in the car now it's being acted like I'm sitting behind a computer and go to the different airlines wish things that's that there are people that are hired for those now if you want to play politics it's fine but don't play politics only with me if I have to account which I'm doing we expect every minister to also account because this is important to all of you I've done absolutely nothing wrong and I'm transparent as possible I went there in fact when I saw it's 125,000 rents for five star hotel I myself and the acting DG we both said we can't do this isn't there a cheaper Hotel I flew I I I I stayed in a fourstar hotel which was a bit cheaper because it was during the Olympics all the prices were up and you can't compare Euros with rents our currency is not that strong and now people want to act like particularly in the da that it's my first time going overseas 20 2007 I stayed for a month in Paris to watch the Rugby World Cup to watch the Rugby World Cup for one month I flew there first class I stayed in a seven star hotel for one month now because it's no longer my own money and I must follow the rules if the rules says I must fly economy class I shall fly economy class so I wanted to just get that out of the way all the media that's here we can still talk about if you have any further questions about the drip but don't say I went for a joy ride and don't compare me to Mama Joy I am not a super fan I'm the minister of sport arts and culture"
GjN2pk3SGmU,"Mshuluzane Mayisela Primary School | Learners ill after suspected consumption of ""poisonous"" snacks",2024-10-17T11:19:50Z,8839,about more than 20 Learners consumed snacks in the morning that were bought from one of the shops uh in the morning when we came by to the school we saw a rather uh um a very uh disturbing incident whereby the community was closing down those paa shops saying uh it's because of these P shops that their children are becoming very ill and others are dying but right now with me I have the white celor Patrick maon who's going to take us through as to what really happened because it seems like we've got limited information but he's going to brief us uh further as to what really happened in the morning at their school and what is the current situation of the Learners that were being rushed to the hospital uh Mr maana can you please brief us as to what really happened at the school in the morning thank you very much ma' maybe I need to rectify one thing I'm not a what counselor here the go counselor is Mr Vena H um his weep by the way from the party that deployed us I'm his we I'm the weip of counselors at this weding so I had to come rushing here when I couldn't get him on his phone then I said no let me quickly come here and make sure that H the situation is come down because when I came in h parents were closing the gate of the school uh saying they want their kids from the school they want their kids because they heard that some of the kids ate unprinted snakes in the morning that they bought from vendors outside the school gate so as Community leaders we needed to get answers from the Department of Education and we couldn't get answers because obviously they need to follow all the steps of reporting so that we get the proper report from their their seniors not the school principal or was not in the state to report to us as to what exactly happened but uh while we we still here we got reports that over 20 Learners yes were were taken to bronos spr hospital but uh by the grace of God they back they were they were then taken to local clinic clinic and Zi clinic and as we can speak we can confirm that they all back with their parents because it was nothing major but H they were just complaining about a r on their skin and while they were being observed by the school remember uh there's a a room in the school called a sick room where they need to be observed they need to observe a child first before they can let the child to either a clinic or a hospital for that matter so meanwhile they were still observing a a message went out to community groups as you know we've got H WhatsApp portals in the community a message went out and it it carried H I won't say lies but not so true information so that's what stepped the parents to come running to the school and at the end of the day they decided to close the school and the school then decided the management of the school said no there's no child that will leave the school without a parent yes we understand parents you want your kids you are closing the school but we are not going to release all the kids only a kit that a parent came and collected to collect the child will be released to parents as you can see behind us the parents are still coming in uh to collect their kids from the school uh thank you so much Mr maana for that information uh this is the fourth incident within October alone that has been reported with the food poisoning uh incident right now we're going to try and find the parents and speak to the parents as to how they feel about this situation and also track down the story right now I'm going to step right now I'm going to step outside of the shot so that my Camara colleague can show you what is really happening out here as you can see the streets are really packed um it's very full parents are fighting uh parents really want to close their school because they think that their children are not safe and earlier on we did see the police who were trying to maintain uh this uh who were trying to maintain this situation but for now we will try and get the parents and we we will keep you updated as to what is really happening at the side that's giving us that that update there and I can imagine it it of course has been a morning of pandemonium there because we understand that there are about 20 ambulances that were busy fing the Learners to the various Health Facilities can we confirm this I have a parent who's going to tell us more as to what has happened oh okay and then Monday okay that was one of the parents also explaining to us that what happened earlier in the morning saying that there were children indeed that were rushed to the hospital and that in the afternoon they'll be having a meeting with um the Indian uh uh people who are owning the spaza shops and also they'll be having a meeting with the vendors that are selling outside the school just to to tell them what is it that they want and what is it that they don't want and I heard you earlier on you were asking about the ambulances uh when we got a call that there is a breaking story at uh bronos spray we we

oXOhKHoBu4I,SA Auto Week  | Liabo Setho has more,2024-10-17T10:08:41Z,638,president s Raposa has just addressed the essay Auto Week in Cape Town now captains of the automotive industry have gathered to celebrate the industry's 100 years in existence the automotive industry contributes 5.3% to GDP now the conference has been discussing ways to drive localization increasing exports in a challenging environment while creating jobs we're now joined by sabc news reporter diabo set for more on this so diabo we heard so much from the president he said that the industry has shown resilience in the face of many challenges what are some of the highlights from the president's speech say thank you so much uh the president did commend the automotive industry for their contribution to the South African economy which you've so rightly mentioned of that it contributes in fact last year contributed 5.3% however the industry is obviously facing headwinds just like any other industry um uh the exports have been down and uh We've also seen how Capital injection from the manufacturing OEM has also declined but when you look at holistically from 1995 to 2004 the picture does tell you of an industry that is really committed to South Africa nearly 500 half a million jobs being created by the sector uh but I thought that we should get rather a deep dive view from one of the manufacturing oems uh Isuzu to find out the kind of challenges they're seeing and uh the trends that they're seeing from their customers who are buying their co uh their vehicles I'm down I'm joined Now by K he is from Isuzu he is the senior vice president for commercial operations Mr piz thank you so much for your time uh the president has mentioned obviously the immeasurable contribution that uh manufacturing OEM have made but there still is an issue with the issue of exports and some of your colleagues the industry have said that maybe we need to look at things differently in terms of your Cal catalytic converters and and and now start looking at the hydrogen the green hydrogen economy tell us about your experience as asuzu and what the president has said uh thank you very much for having me um the big challenge that we've been seeing in South Africa is mainly the lower cost Imports that are coming into the country which have really been driving uh some of the challenges that the local manufacturers experiencing but in addition to that we've seen the high interest rates that we've had in the country that have impacted the consumers and as forecasted by namsa we did expect that the first half of the year will be challenging now as the industry there has been some investment that have been made for example like the lives of ourselves Isuzu we've invested in the tooling and in some Capital to help refresh our product to try and grow our business and uh grow our brand um I think the biggest thing that we need to be looking at um um as an industry together with the government is more around protection of the industry and protection of the industry will happen in two ways firstly is around the policies to protect the industry in terms of looking at incentives as well as looking at um the duties to protect the industry grow the volume so that there could be more investment and there could be further increase or growth in employment which we've really done very well over the last couple of years you can just give us perhaps an idea of the people or the customers that are buying isusu products what are they looking for um out of a vehicle looking look at how The Innovation is changing around cleaner fuels um and much more efficient automobiles well isus of example we we really known as a commercial vehicle company firstly from commercial point of view our customers are looking for first the lowest cost per use uh second thing they're looking for reliability on the use and then the third part is consumers are already starting to talk about new energy vehicles and these are some of the things that we know that we working on as Isuzu to support the consumers and Ensure we protect the brand and we meet the consumers needs into the future yeah the President also mentioned about how sentiment is starting to change um there is a word that you know uh the government as well as private sector are expecting a more than 3% economic growth by next year looking at the economic variables uh right now uh are you confident that uh what the narrative that the government is sharing um and what you're experiencing on the ground you will be able to uh increase that investment that you have been making already I think the starting signs are starting to come through uh firstly looking at um the the easing of uh uh of of inflation the the reduction in the reper rate which in a couple of months will help the consumers and start bringing the confidence and consumer spending and um we seeing Improvement obviously over 200 days with no load shading and there's some work that still needs to be done from Logistics point of view in terms of um improving the efficiencies at trans net there is some positivity but a lot of work still needs to be done both by government and um and and with support of private sector but most important is that government needs to build the capacity to be able to sustain those improvements without the need of intervention from the private sector yeah we are also observing transport month as the month of of October what kind of initiatives are uh you having at Isuzu to encourage you know easier mobility and to make sure that uh people still look at transport um in a holistic way in a way that that is efficient in in South Africa uh let's start talking about our product itself I mean we know that we be working on things like the compressed natural gas um vehicle or from commercial point of view to help in terms of um the use and the lower cost as well as the impact on the environment but the second part is that we're working with the industry in uh helping and supporting to make sure that um the corridor on Rail between Ken and Eastern Cape gets to work again so that we can reduce the amount of vehicles on the road and we can be able to reduce the impact and make it workable for the community Mr K thank you so much for your time I appreciate it I've been in conversation with Mr K he is the senior vice president for commercial operations at Isuzu um really just giving us an A View From uh industry perspective on everything that the president did mention in his speech today as well as um future endeavors as well as um what they would like to see in order for them to make a meaningful contribution we will be speaking to other industry leaders throughout the day today uh to find out their views about what has been said today today and with that it's back to you in studio all right that's our dioo watching that story thanks very much indeed for that update

Z6rbQIDIbgU,"Breast Cancer Awareness Month | Men, women called to regularise screening",2024-10-17T09:54:02Z,176,"breast cancer among South African women is increasing according to cancer breast cancer Remains the most common cancer affecting women of all Races in the country sadly breast cancer has caused 670,000 deaths globally in the year 20122 now according to the World Health Organization now for more national manager of the health programs at the Cancer Association of South Africa Lorraine Governor joins us now on teams thank you so much for your time on the program today so I'm sort of middle-aged and I feel like and I look great and no one in my family has breast cancer do I still need to do breast examinations and who's prone to getting uh breast cancer is it men women talk to us about that yeah good morning and thank you so much for this opportunity so everyone is at a risk of getting breast cancer uh men also get breast cancer 1% of men do get breast cancer so the figures stand at 1 in 922 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer according to the National Cancer registry um which records the cancer incidents in our country one in 26 women are affected by breast cancer so that alone shows that the risk increases uh among women as opposed to men and yes um you're young and and um breast cancer also affects many women under the age of 40 and let's talk about some of the factors that increase the risk of breast cancer is there any risk factor that stands out particularly in the South African context yeah I think um there are many factors and looking at the South African context um definitely uh if we look at overweights um and having uh low levels of physical activity we you know that really does stand out and that's one of the risk factors for breast cancer and then alcohol and tobacco use also increases the risk um but then all women are at risk uh but uh if you have a family history of breast cancer it increases your risk as well um another risk factor is women who've never had children or only had them after the age of 30 also uh puts them at risk of uh getting breast cancer um and then the fact that breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting the women in our country that alone tells you that they that there will be a family history uh to breast cancer and ayanda it's not only um if you have a family history of breast cancer that you will get breast cancer even um if you have a family history of other cancers including prostate cancer puts you at a risk for breast cancer and many of the other cancers as well and Miss Governor I want to actually go back to this month that we observing quite a very important month that we are observing but also have a problem and that problem is that sometimes we tend to have these conversations around this month these are conversations that are sort of uh played and paused again this month where we bring awareness and sometimes we even see those mobiles coming through to the townships as well as the rural areas to talk about breast cancer let's talk about awareness where are and so far as awareness is concerned and what will it take for these conversations to just move Beyond this month definitely and you know ayanda when it comes to October everyone says it's the Cancer month but people forget it's actually breast cancer awareness month so breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting uh women but then there's also prostate cancer among men and there's over 300 different types of cancers um that affect our people but uh I think the awareness in October is definitely around breast cancer and um the you know people see all the pink and they get uh caught up in the hype of the pink and sometimes we people do forget what is this hype all about so yes there's a lot um we depend on print and radio media and you know um we're so thankful to sabc for actually having us and you know there's a lot of messaging on radio as well creating awareness so youin depend on on those channels to communicate the messaging around the awareness but people still you know there is the problem that okay I think I have a lump but I'm not sure so it's fear of the unknown uh should I go uh to the doctor should I go to the clinic and then the thought of okay I need to take time off from work these are some of the things that you know people uh don't usually access the services when they do pick up the lump and sometimes you find that women really don't even do self bre examinations and yet it's something that it's you know so easy to be done and most of the time you will find um people that who have uh been diagnosed with breast cancer will tell you you know I did a breast examination or I felt the lump sometimes ayanda they don't even go uh for further investigations you know they they have the lump and they continue they worry they know that something is wrong um breast cancer can spread you know and once it spread it becomes more difficult to treat the cancer and you lose a breast it sometimes can even spread to other organs in your body and it becomes quite difficult and costly to treat the cancer and people even die you know the figures that you quoted earlier on it's it's quite High globally people that die women that die from breast cancer and this shouldn't be because we do have a good Public Health System where people can access the the screening through the clinics uh there's Treatment available you know I know of many people who have gone to the public sector and and have survived breast cancer due to the treatment that they have received so it's better that we actually access the services that we have available in our country yes there may be waiting periods but there's also hope that you will survive it and let's talk about the support uh what sort of support uh do breast cancer survivors need after diagnosis yeah and this is so crucial um because you often find that um you know between the different race groups and cultures uh it changes and often when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer it it is a lifechanging moment for them because our breasts are you know they add to our image and the look and how we feel it's also an organ that is used to breastfeed our children so it's it's so important to a lot of women but you find that um there isn't much support to start off with people don't often talk about the pray the breast cancer incidents they keep it to themselves and yet we know that if you have a genetic predisposition it increases your risk for breast cancer so we want more people to talk about the cancer and if you talk about your cancer there's definitely support available yes the public sector is quite um you know full in terms of the support services that they have and it may not be easy for you to speak to your doctor or to your clinician but there are Nos and non-government organizations that are really there to support people so you know you don't even have to go into a place you can just call telephonically the Cancer Association has a telec counseling line um that is free to the public it's available in over seven different languages um there are various support groups available for people um and there are also NOS that do use their mobile clinics and they go out into communities and they do uh clinical braas examinations for women in a lot of the communities and this is all made possible from Grants that become available and donors that really want to see a difference in people's lives by giving us funding to help people in underserved communities and Miss Governor now that you've touched on funding I mean the riseing costs of treatment poses a challenge to survivors and health funders and that is the reality on the ground I mean in one incident the hting Department of Health failure to utilize the allocated 784 million Rand set aside by w treasury back in 2023 to address the radiation backlog and other surgical backlogs in Ken that would be an example what's the solution to some of the funding challenges that we seeing in the sector right now if we definitely uh need uh all of government approach and we really need to look at what can we do to improve the services and ensure that the funding that is being uh given to people is actually utilized for the correct purposes um if you look at um mamogram which is one of uh the diagnostic services that is available uh you find that people uh are often disillusioned you know they they lose hope because they have to wait for a period of time before they can even go in for a mamogram so um definitely if funding is made available there can be more of the services available to people a quicker turnaround time in terms of the treatment and definitely this can improve the quality of life uh but I know I really want to urge the public don't despair don't lose hope don't think that the health system is going to fail you yes we've had many failures and challenges but there's also hope you know it's important for you to make that call to go and access that service and the Cancer Association and there are other organizations as well that do a lot in in terms of advocacy so you know if you have problems and you have challenges and you can't access treatment or access diagnostic services please do call the cancers Association we have an advocacy Department that's dedicated to support and help people to ensure that we have better turnaround times for accessing treatment and diagnostic services and Miss governor before I let you go now there's a dear viewer at home that's feeling a lump in that part of uh the the the breast or whatever or wherever the case may be let's just hear from you where do they go from here moving forward yeah so it depends um so if you are uh someone um uh that's living in a community and you have picked up that you have a lump you definitely can go through to your nearest Primary Healthcare Clinic because there are many primary healthcare clinics where the nurses and the healthcare professionals have been trained on doing clinical breast examinations on you so even if you go in for a peps meia the Department of Health also ensures that they do a clinical breast examination so once you've done the examination and the and the nurse or the healthcare provider has picked up the you have a lump they will then refer you to the closest hospital for a mamogram so a mamogram is done to detect you know the lump and the size of the lump after that you will then go in for a biopsy to just check whether the the lump is at malignant or it's panine um so not every lump and this is important as well not every lump means you have cancer so you know sometimes those lamps are benign and you may not even need to go for for the investigations or to have a mastectomy or your breast removed so those are some of it and if you are still not comfortable with that please do go to the Cancer Association we do a screening for people clinical breast examinations uh our number is 800262 or you can even go to your healthcare provider if you um if you are still worried you can also access your hospital to say you want to go in for a mamogram uh and you know for the the test can be done for you and Miss Governor as well I think quite a cause for concern is looking at our rural areas in your rural as well as and other rural areas as well people still grapple with accessibility to such facilities where do such people go does this mean that they left in the Lurch definitely not uh and we know that government also has mobile clinics so our the mobile clinics definitely go into underserved communities the Cancer Association also has mobile clinics and we do go into communities so people are more than welcome to call us if they are worried and they have a lump and they want to know where to go to you can contact us and we have a t-free line that will give you um information on where you can go to for further investigations and yes we want to access people we want to really help people and you must not be afraid to really go to your Primary Healthcare Clinic that is closest to you to have that lump checked out okay that is lorine gor who is the national manager of health programs at the Cancer Association of South Africa on teams thanks very much indeed for your time"
8j8BmIaWRa8,SA Auto Week | President Ramaphosa addresses gathering,2024-10-17T09:13:43Z,1284,president s Raposa is addressing the sa Auto Week in Cape Town now captains of the automotive industry have gathered to celebrate the industry's 100 years in existence the automotive industry contributes 5.3% to the GDP now the conference has been discussing ways to drive localization increasing exports in a challenging environment while creating jobs the event is being held at a time when the Moto industry is facing significant headwinds among them low demand for Vehicles owing to a depressed Market as well as the transition to electric vehicles let's listen in in North America in Europe as well as in Asia the automotive industry is also a major employer in our country and that in itself places it in a very special position for an industry that employs collectively some half a million people means that it is an industry that should be taken seriously not only because it is a manufacturing center but because it employs a good number of people so we're delighted about that because it spends quite a number of sub sectors the retail manufacturing and a number of other sectors as well the sector continues to actively support transformation as you may well know that is a very important objective policy objective set out by the government that I lead since it was established in 2021 the automotive transformation fund has supported a number of beneficiaries and we're really delighted about this it has facilitated Market access for blackowned as well as female owned firms to the value of 4 billion and supported approximately a number of thousands of jobs across the industry value chain this year marks a 100 Years of vehicle Manufacturing in South Africa this is a milestone that needs to be celebrated since the first Model T Ford rolled off the assembly line in the Ford plant in Port elizabetha today in 1924 South Africa's Automotive Manu manufacturing footprint has expanded exponentially international auto companies are major investors in the South African economy they have consistently featured prominently at the annual South African investment conference which we inaugurated in 2018 over the past few years these companies have invested an average of some 8 billion Rand a year and we really delighted that they come up to the stage and join a number of companies that make pledges and I'm pleased to say that the pledges that are made by a number of auto companies are pledges that move from pledge to real investment in PL PL in new plans and in Improvement of plants component suppliers have invested a considerable amount of money as well some 4 billion Rand on average a year the industry gies like Ford VW BMW Toyota and others continue to demonstrate real confidence in our economy by expanding and upgrading existing operat ations and from humble beginnings a century ago this industry has shown remarkable resilience the success of the automotive sector since the Advent of our democracy is Testament to the success of transformative industrial policy and I'm particularly pleased that we have former minister of trade and Industry as it was called then now in trade industry and competition Alec awing who used to be uh comrade I don't know whether you are still called comrade in the corporate world comrades in the Trade union movement but we delighted that he's here and as I entered I stopped to give him a nice hug because he indeed is the Pioneer one of the key actors who enabled this industry to be repositioned to where it is today we have pursued an industrial policy underpinned by increased value addition and through our support programs and master plan we have striven to ensure that the automotive sector is stronger globally competitive and transformed through the automotive master plan we aim to increase the industry's contribution to Global Production and increase local content to about 60% we aim to bring new companies into the value chain and increase value addition as well yet even as we can celebrate the achievements of the last 100 years the industry still faces considerable headwinds like all manufacturing the Auto industry was hit very hard by covid-19 global tensions and international conflicts have also disrupted Supply chains the global transition towards decarbonization presents a fundament Al challenge to the industry as well and the transition towards cleaner and more sustainable fuels together with stringent regulations in key markets puts a number of Automotive firms and sub Industries in what one could say vulnerable positions even as the journey to Net Zero poses a challenge for the Auto industry there is at the same time what I would call immense opportunity the local automotive sector needs to position itself to take advantage for the demand of electric vehicles new energy vehicles and sustainable fuels I had occasion to visit visit China a few weeks ago and was regaled as we visited one of the manufacturers and they informed us that they're focusing more and more on electric vehicles and they would like to come to this Market I also in New York Met another key Vehicle Manufacturer who then offered that he could take me through the streets of New York in a driverless car I was terrified and I said no uh I no longer have a license but the alure of being in a car without uh the driver and just you driving the car with gadgets uh was great but I was terrified so the transition to cleaner more sustainable practices in the automotive industry is a priority for our government the automotive industry has a critical role to play in achieving South Africa's climate targets we're committed to working hand inand with the private sector to promote the production of new energy vehicles and the development of the necessary infrastructure to support them the opening of parliament address in July this year I said that South Africa will look to beneficiate more of our critical minerals instead of them leaving our country in raw form it is therefore encouraging that the department of trade and Industry and competition together with the national Treasury and the department of mineral and petroleum resources are in conversation about implementing the electric vehicle white paper this work includes the beneficiation of our critical minerals for the production of the new energy vehicles and their Associated value chains it also includes the production of batteries for battery electric vehicles and the development of value chains in the green hydrogen fuel cell Market we are working to finalize comprehensive Nev policy guidelines that do not exclude alternative Technologies such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids so consideration must be given to incentives for manufacturers as well as what will please you tax rebates or subsidies for consumers to accelerate uptake of electri elect Vehicles this is not just about creating a Greener future but also about ensuring South Africa remains competitive in the global market as many of our major trading partners rapidly shift towards EBS it is also imperative that we remain part of this Global Supply Chain if we don't we will be left behind this is a major industrialization opportunity for our country and the region as well particularly within the context of the African Continental free trade area this will position South Africa as a forward thinking green economy it will advance our aspirations to be a global automative Hub as Government we remain firmly committed to the work that is already underway to improve the operational performance of our energy Freight and logistic sectors all of which directly impacts the automotive industry transnet continues with its work to revitalize the port of Durban it also it is also proceeding with the upgrade of the hting Eastern Cape Railway line as part of project as the government of national Unity Mr maasa was boasting to me he was saying you were talking about the government of national Unity yesterday so as I came in they were briefing me for a while and he was boasting that Mr President we have a government of national unity and I run it pointing to himself and I said how how come he says I have 56 companies that compete with each other so I'm the head of this government of national Unity so I said okay you beat me then maybe you should come do my job because I only have 10 so um it may be waiting on the wings to compete to be president of South Africa soon but as a government of national Unity we have prioritized inclusive economic growth and job creation when we signed our statement of intent amongst the 10 parties we put econom IC growth and job creation as the number one priority we look forward to deepening our collaboration as government industry and labor to achieve both these objectives there may be headwinds and there will always be headwinds and there will be challenges at the same time but challenges much as they are there they also lie opportun unities side by side it is up to business to take up these opportunities to grow and to harness them and to expand and to transform and when it comes to transformation I should say you are one of those industries that I have found to be forward looking when it comes to transformation not only in your use of Technology but in your commitment to Skilling and upskilling a number of people who work in your industry some years ago I was rather pleased to have heard that Auto Workers who were trained here who were black were exported to Germany to go and teach German Workers about the makeup of what of Germany's prized uh vehicles and it pleased me greatly that ordinary workers from the townships OFA had been sent to Germany to go and show German Workers about German product that had originated in Germany how it should be made better and that is something that was pleasing so you have continued to be leaders in a number of areas and your commitment as an industry to transformation is what has made government to be also equally committed to supporting your industry and as Minister T said uh we will continue to support this industry because you're a special industry contributing 5.3% of to our GDP and employing so many workers and we want to see more and more people getting employment in your industry and we want to see more and more transformation so that those who were previously locked out of meaningful participation in your industry should also find ways of participating particularly women and young people as

bYJmUdSkNbs,National Listening and Learning Tour | FS Education MEC on the minister's visit,2024-10-17T08:30:17Z,298,today here in bloom Fontaine we've got the minister of basic education s qu H she was supposed to have been uh you know supported or as part of her Entourage be accompanied by the Min Deputy minister of basic education uh but she's not here she is however accompanied by the Mec of Free State education Dr Miki uh mauya and she as she was s in the hall explaining to other educator about the challenges that they've she has encountered in her 100 days in office that the general challenges that they see in the province are those of the infrastructure uh and and those that are of administration that they need to deal with but not let me not talk too much but get into the grips with her just to tell us as the Mec for basic education MEC listening and learning tour what have you discovered so far this is the seventh place where the minister is visiting her first time in the province as the minister of basic education let's speak about this tour and what is are you actually likely to encounter as you'll be going through around the The Province uh thank you very much um yeah the minister uh of basic education is here today uh May gu she's visiting us as the province we are told that this is the seventh province that she's visiting and we are quite happy that she is here because it's a true indication that she is preparing to learn H the the the a lot of things H since she'll be leading the sector she's new in the sector and uh she is prepared to come and listen and learn out of uh the provinces and we also appreciate the fact that she understands that education that delivery of service in terms of Education happens at the vinal level particularly at the level of the schools so she will be visiting four schools from here we'll be visiting about four schools that she will be interacting where she'll be interacting with the management of the schools with the Educators and so on but what is key for us is the fact that uh uh she is not just here to learn but she's also here to make sure that she comes back and enriches our interventions as a sector to make sure that we close all the gaps so that we are able to deliver quality education in the Free State here I've already taken my my TOS I've done my TOS I've interacted with a number of um uh stakeholders teachers principals sgbs parents and and and Learners themselves and uh we have picked up a lot of challenges that are there much as a lot is been done to mitigate those challenges but some of them H remain and uh one of them being the fact that we are experiencing budget cuts and when you talk about budget cuts as being a sector which is highly people driven obviously it will have an impact on the budget for compensation of a employees and that is one of the challenges and that one also now has got a ripple impact on other programs program such as uh the provision of uh ltsm learning and teaching support material obviously that will be affected in the school where we are now Learners are supposed to be having sufficient device devices assistive devices and obviously that will also be be affected we are giving them but we might not sufficiently be able to cover all those areas not only that but uh things such as your your your lard transport will also be affected this will also affect other areas of operation which are very critical as we are moving towards you know improving the quality of Education we know that if we don't for instance uh F the post of admin staff especially at school level then that will bring the burden administrative burden on teachers and that will defocus them a little bit from doing the actual work of teaching and now they have to do admin work those are some of the challenges of course uh school safety is another area of concern and if we don't have sufficient and Warm Bodies as security H at our schools we will continue to have uh these challenges but but as I was engaging with parents I also made them aware that it is their responsibility as communities around the schools to ensure that they protect uh their assets which is uh our schools and amplifying also the notion that teaching or education is a societal uh issue I know as well that the there is that challenge of temporary teachers who have been you know at schools for the longest time and they are not getting permanent jobs and also the issue of uh B teachers a foundation fa teachers who are you know are in short supply how how are you dealing with with that challenge yeah the challenge that we have I must say is a is a sector wide H type of a challenge it's not only a free state challenge but what we are doing now we are prioritizing what we call critical post uh we ensure that we we are doing all what we can to ensure that we have H A in every class we do have a teacher that one we I can rest assure you and uh the fact that we do have your Collective Agreement it means that the jobs of per permanent teachers are are protected but with regard to your basket of those uh ad hoc teachers as well as temporary teachers as and when we we get those gaps where there are no teachers we are able to tap from that basket that basket is still there it is funded so we'll be able therefore to take teachers out of those and then close whatever GS that will Beav it's only 4 days away before the metric write the final year exams how confident are you with the free state in terms of their performance this year uh the Free State uh province the Department of Education has been uh performing well for some time I think we have quite a well oiled Machin by now and uh as a result we are confident that that spot will still be jealously you know safeguarding it and making sure that uh it belongs to to the free state that's where the the sport belongs and but uh we have sort of changed our the way we are doing things now because we are saying we are not just comfortable with um the passes that we have we now have to look at uh the quality of passes we are seriously looking into the issue of quality we don't just want to be number one in terms of quantity meaning the number of Learners who would have passed but we want to be number one in terms of the number of Bachelor passes as well as diploma passes that we produce so as a result we have actually elevated or graduated from being Simply the Best to being simply excellent so this is what we are striving for and we have done all what we needed to do to ensure that we walk our Learners into the exam room confidently so after supporting them with all sorts of uh interventions we are confident that our Learners will not disappoint us they will still do us H H good as a Province and as a nation so we are confident that we are still going to remain the number one province in the country MC Dr M thank you very much for your time thank you D that is MC for free State education Dr Miki mauya outlining the provinces Readiness and intervention in where they are having problems with regard to education in the province for
oyedGJaCAMU,NPA | Batohi feels unsupported by Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development,2024-10-17T08:27:42Z,2552,the national director of public prosecutions Advocate shamila batoy says that she doesn't feel supported by parliament's Justice and constitutional development portfolio committee btoy was speaking at an Institute for security studies seminar in Cape Town on Tuesday under the theme driving Justice and future proofing the national Prosecuting Authority and uh this is where Independence of the institution was in the spotlight batoy has repeatedly emphasized the independence of the national prosecuting Authority and she was appointed to hit the NPA in 2018 by President Sama posa and her term of office will end in 2026 now she is the first woman to be appointed permanently as National director of public prosecutions uh for reaction to this we are joined virtually by the chairperson of the portfolio committee on Justice and constitutional development Mr T NOA but before we speak to uh Mr NOA let's take a look at this insert Advocate shamila batoy has repeatedly emphasized the need for the independence of the national Prosecuting Authority at the seminar hosted by The Institute for security studies she was asked whether she feels supported by the justice and constitutional development committee do you feel that you have the support of that committee and of parliament in general when it comes to all of these issues that you have been putting on the short answer which is very sad because we regard Parliament as a very important sorry to interrupt you uh a very important instrument of accountability in our constitutional democracy it's really important that's why State capture thrived is because Parliament the zondo commission found that didn't do what it should have been should have done and so we regard accountability as one of our strategic pillars we we really want a portfolio Comm that seriously holds us to account um in respect of you know our our high level strategies you know what and and and understands our challenges and and tries to support and guide us in terms of how we can strengthen this incredibly important institution in our democracy it's NPA to be able to do its work better and we and we would really want that kind of support and guidance from the committee we're not seeing it at the moment hopefully change B toi says to date there has been no interference with the npa's work by President s Raposa or his executive she painted a different picture about the day-to-day operational running of the NPA but there's another aspect to the independence of of the prosecuting Authority and that is the functional Independence and the able to actually deliver effectively on your mandate she described budget decisions and certain appointments within the NPA as hindrances to the entity's independence the NPA is dependent on the Department of Justice for its budget meanwhile Justice and constitutional development portfolio committee chaira NOA says the committee always strives to support all entities falling under it but he said he would first speak with batoi before responding to her remarks Abra Baria sabc News Cape Town and we are now joined by Mr and thank you so much for making the time this morning Mr NOA uh firstly have you had opportunity to engage with the ndpp yes of course again and also thank you for for having us this morning we did speak with the NPP regarding this matter I think she's the one who first called uh that there might be this kind of thing that may be misinterpreted that she would have said in a seminar and she she tried to put it into context and I think we understood where she's coming from and I think from where was sated we can say that we fully support NPA and its operations and we are holding NPA accountable you'll recall just recently there was an issue that was pered to be an impass between NPA and the the department that relates to access to a z database which is something that we we quickly attended to so it is our strong belief that from where was seated we do support and hold the NP accountable of course everyone is is allowed to critique Parliament but I think we should contextualize things correctly even even when when it comes to issues relating to Independence Mr if we can backpaddle for a moment because you had the conversation with um Advocate chamila batoy we were not privy to it what we heard uh at that particular seminar and that we just played um our reporter Abra Baria asking a very direct question to the ndpp and her response was very Swift and very clear no does not feel supported by the portfolio committee so what was the explanation that was given to you what is that we may have misunderstood in what was said look we are a new committee we have only met with the NPA three times when dealing with the issue of the zondo commission access to database and um the issue of the annual reports and the issue of the TRC matters so why new committee completely was still working on some of the things but the explanation that I think the NPP made was seriously on the on the basis of it's a longstanding problem that they would been they they have been experiencing as NPA regarding the issue of the independence you remember this is a matter that in terms of the legal framework currently that gives NPA a prosecutorial Independence but in terms of budgeting for NPA it is true it is budgeted through vote 25 of the Department of Justice so they have been decrying this matter I still remember in the sixth Parliament the issue that they raised was the issue of um the the the judicial matters Amendment bill that does not address this matter and we as the new committee have received as through through what they call the Legacy report from the sixth Parliament so part of what we've done currently to support the NPA call is to call upon the department to submit all the legislations that ought to be amended and we have specifically spoken ER with the Department to to send particularly a draft bill on the NPA act not later than January 2025 so in the phone call that I had with the ntpp we we we we iring out those things because I I I I did hear what what she said in the seminar and from where I'm seated we would not come to a determination that the the committee doesn't support you when the committee is actually two three months old so so she did take context that's why even in the interview in the sem she Reed she refers to matters that relate to the zondo commission that would have found Parliament not to be doing its work which is something that I think since the last Parliament has been improving so it's a matter that we discussed and we we we we understood each other the central issue here cendo is in terms of the Constitution and in terms of the NPA act the person who who exercises the final authority over NPA is the Minister of Justice so it means then therefore if you want to change that the parliament must undergo rigorous process of amending the law it takes its own time H so it's it's work under way as i' I've just mentioned now that we have given January 2025 as a cut of date from the Department to submit all the relative Amendment bills so so that we attend to this matter once and for all of course it's a matter that is going to take its time but remember the lawmaking process takes it takes it its time but I can bet where you that since the last Parliament this matter has been in discussion as a result the sixth Parliament even deferred the matter to the seventh Parliament and what we have done as our first priority was to attend to pending bills not the only bill by the way a lot of bills that we have said must be submitted so that we are able to process them properly so from where we are seated in terms of pro utorial Authority n PA is actually independent such that they are the ones who take decisions whether to prosecute or not to prosecute but what they are deing is the issue relating to H the budget vote that they are within the budget budget vote 25 and therefore the accounting office Still Remains the director General and stuff it's a matter that is underway it's a matter that we still going to discuss with the NPA thally so that we are able to iron out some of the issues but remember the issue of enacting laws amending laws is a rigorous process that warrants serious engagement there is even the public that is um that is that is that is playing its own part so discussion we have we have went to that extent that look this is what Parliament is doing because I was trying to understand her point and and trying to make her understand the work that we are doing currently and as it as as it relates to account ability holding them to account I mean the first meeting we held with them was the issue relating to the Z database we wanted NPA to have access to the Z database so they pursue prosecution so we support and hold them accountable they've just done an annual report and performance report just recently and of course uh quite apart from the operation and operational and financial issues um b toy also spoke about the process of appointing a national director uh describing it as problematic and and also highlighting the need for amendments to legislation in this regard how critical uh is the npa's independence from your perspective as the portfolio committee exercising oversight over it very much critical the independence of of the NPA is very much important and critical if we want actually that we want the rule of law to try in the country we all support that NPA must be independent and must operate in accordance to to the law and uh be accountable to Parliament but as I said before even the appointment of the national director of public prosecutions is is dictated by law so it therefore means if we were to change the appointment process we therefore would would have to undergo the the the the amendment of laws which is the NP Act and the Constitution and it takes its own time but I think we have we have noted what they are registering we are considering and processing what they are registering it's not a new thing Sakina it has been there in the sixth Parliament which was deferred to the seventh Parliament due to a shortage of or passage of time so so it's a matter that receives our priority as the committee and we are going to uh to to engage with the ntpp from time to time H where she feels that we are not giving necessary support we definitely going to engage with them that's the nature of the relationship that we have and the nature of the working relationship about to have so any matter that she thinks we not doing well any matter that we think she's not doing well we engage it with her yeah that's what we have to leave it unfortunately but appreciate your time Mr NOA who's the chairperson of the portfolio committee on Justice and constitutional development reacting to National director of public prosecutions Advocate shamila btoy saying she does not feel supported by parliament's Justice and constitutional development portfolio committee and of course since 2002 at least the office of the auditor general has been calling for the npa's financial Independence so talking about Amendment of the laws it's been coming for a long time for
1jEtXGNwZxg,Marhagi Secondary School | Suspected food poisoning scare,2024-10-17T07:47:35Z,1128,more than 20 Learners from the Mahi secondary school at Verina in balanga were rushed to guamanga clinic and hospital for suspected food poisoning this is after they complained of headaches stomach cramps and some began vomiting it's alleged that the Learners consumed acher at school now reporter is on the store and joins us now for a live update so very good morning to you so do we know how the Learners are doing right now uh it's a very good morning to you and the viewers at home indeed we are at M Secondary School in vinaa section that is situated inanga um what we heard we heard that all the Learners were fortunately discharged yesterday and all of them they in a very uh safe position no one has uh been sick after after the incident happened and indeed yes all the lers need consume the Archer the lers are 21 to be exact and this happens to be the first in uh the first incident that has been reported in mumang as to compared to other provinces for an example I'll make an example uh with houting in hting they have reported so far three cases uh this October but in buang it's only one but just to get more as to what really happened yesterday and how are the Learners doing right now we'll be talking to the sgb chairperson F Bazi who's going to tell us more as to what's really happening and what are they hoping for from the Department of educ call from Secretary of thep as we speak dep come that was the sgb chair person Mr moazi explaining to us as to what really happened and he says he got the call from the secretary of the sgb telling them that there's a situation at school and when they got there they found children uh some of the children had headache some were vitting and others had stomach crims and they quickly rushed to the local clinic and the others were transer refer to guanga hospital and uh the most important thing is that the sgb member asked uh the the health pract practitioners at the hospital to take samples of that acher so that they could know what really was in that Archer so they can take further steps as to uh what what was really in that Archer and for now I also have one of the parents who's going to tell us what really happened to her child just after she consumed AA and the parent is umang she's going to tell us more ch EXP indeed that was one of the parent who um gave her child the pills that they call that it's charcoal she says it drains the poison instead of taking the child to the hospital she gave the child those pills and the pills and the child is now fine and she would also like to plead that the women who are selling uh outside they should not go and get whatever that they selling at the Indian shops rather get their things from different shops not at the Indian shops because they they normally remove the expiring date and then those things get sold to the kids so for now we will keep on tracking the story further because we can see that more and more parents are are coming in more people still have um Expressions to to to to show us they still have a lot to say and so we will keep on tracking the story and see as to what is really happening and get more information about what is really happening for now it's back to you and while we still have you on the line from what we Gathering right now is that this archa may have possibly been obtained from the vendors at the school right not directly from maybe from the feeding scheme at the school from what you've been hearing there on the ground right now am I correct we heard that the person who is selling archa is one of the vendors who have been here at school for far too long and what we heard we heard that she is also part of the sgb uh members uh so I don't think that she would deliberately um put in something in that AR so remember that we had heat wave just over the weekend and so possibilities are high that maybe uh the Archer maybe was ruined or stuff but we still hoping that we're going to bump into her and just get information get facts rather than uh hearing what other people say this and say that and so it's best if we get the person who was selling the Archer to give us facts as to what really happened with the Archer why did the children have R runn stomach after consuming the Archer let's rather not give speculation about this issue indeed that's what I was actually going to say now that as the investigations continue we will be keeping an eye on those investigations to find out what the exact cause of all of this was and of course giving us some insights and some views there those are the views of the people there on the ground
JdTkcQEPQNI,"SASSA | ""Fraud"" uncovered in SRD grant",2024-10-17T07:43:19Z,21464,"two firste computer science students at Stellenbosch University Joel cedras and ver goai claimed to have uncovered massive fraud in the social relief of distress Grant that's administered by the South African Social Security Agency Sasa now fraudsters are led to use unsuspecting citizens identity numbers in order to apply for the SRD Grant and they then received the funds in bank accounts that they've set up using the same ID numbers now this fraud is said to involve tens of thousands of fraudulent social relief of distress Grant applications the SRD Grant is supposed to relieve you know the unemployment burden from uh this tough economic climate that we're currently in uh but to talk to us more about the matter we joined virtually Now by ver gai who's a first year geoinformatics student majoring in computer science from the University of stellos and executive manager grants administration at Sasa Brenton fun free also with us gentlemen thanks for speaking to us this morning welcome to morning live for both of you I'm going to start with you ver um how did you uncover this alleged fraud in the social relief of distress Grant good morning good morning um initially this all started when me and Joel you know we we personally checked if our saasa grants were being stolen and and we were shocked to find out that there were bank accounts on our name open without our knowledge um and SAS applications created and and and people were actually receiving payments on on our behalf so this was purely by chance but then you obviously decided to investigate further why and what did you discover um so we we were both we are both computer science students so obviously we had the necessary skills to you know dig deeper and we we we entered you know the Sasa website and discovered that the API or or program that powers the website was slightly unsecure and it allowed us to check um if anyone had a a a Sasa Grant application active on the ID number so it was quite interesting uh the findings and the conclusions that you came to ver because uh you and Joel then uh actually broadened that search by speaking to some of your fellow students so talk to us about what did subsequently so we we managed to do a a small survey of about 60 people on campus and we found out that 56 people on the University campus um had fulin Sasa applications as a matter of fact a lot of them didn't even know what what Sasa is and from that we we thought you know this this is definitely a larger issue and we we ended up testing um all the possible ID numbers for people born in 2005 February and and we we found an incredible High rate of of Sasa applications at over 91% which is of course staggering but let me bring you in here uh Brenton fanera are you able to confirm as Sasa the findings by the two University of selenos students uh regarding what is going on with the SRD grants thanks Sakina and good morning to your listeners I I think maybe just to give a little bit of context and I think maybe the unfortunate part in this is that this uh that we Joe did not necessarily reach out to Sasa um to discuss this with us prior to to going going public you know this is not this this story has been in the media since January last year uh so for example if you take the ground up article that that was released on Monday ground up themselves published this in January uh last year uh we've put significant control measures in place since then if you look at just the article right apologies there um seemed to have a bit of a technical glitch on that line and uh we are in conversation of course with Mr Brenton fan Frieda who grants Administration manager executive manager at Sasa uh and uh we also have V gusai with us first year student at the University of stellos talking about how he and um a partner of his actually found that their ID numbers were fraudulently used to claim SRD grants uh so these SRD grants were being paid but not to them and uh they subsequently went on to do a bit of a broader investigation and found uh some interesting outcomes uh so we seem to have lost U Mr fanfa there but uh V Kai let me come back to you uh just to talk to us a little bit more and uh maybe also just touch on what Mr fan frea had said he says that it's a pity you didn't reach out to them uh but of course this goes back to you and your findings and whether you of course stand by what it is that you believe you've uncovered yes and I I mean we we we did not reach out to Sasa specifically in a media capacity you know representing groundup but the the biggest concern we had is we did reach out to Sasa um we we reached out as as normal customers we we phone the telephone lines most of them do not work already which was shocking to find out um and the national hotline like didn't seem to help us we were told specific things you know um two weeks ago that our issue would be dealt with and and that it would be resolved within a a turnaround time of a few days but my friend Joel cedis and my partner in this is is still currently waiting for for a respond from Sasa his Sasa grant that he he called about two weeks ago has has not been resolved his ID number is is still being fraudulently used on a fraudulent phone number all right I believe we have Mr Brenton Fran fra from Sasa back with us uh apologies there uh to you and to our listeners not sure what happened there but all the same Mr vredo you were still uh speaking and you had mentioned that it's a Pity that uh Mr cedras and Mr Kai didn't reach out to Sasa and whilst you uh were away Mr kosai actually explained that they did reach out to Sasa via the available Avenues uh but unfortunately had no response and uh Mr Joel sedis his account his ID uh details are still being used in terms of this SRD but please continue from where you left off thanks s so I I I suppose we we could take that up with with with the students we've also been trying to reach out to them in the course of this week so hopefully we'll be able to have a sit down sometime um with him to figure out you know what it is that they've done um and and so on um but again you've reached out to usina we we've responded to you ground after has reached out to us we've responded to them um B FM when they first went live with this interview on Thursday Friday we were Opera with them as well so we are reachable um and maybe it's just the channels that the students use that that that that that that they've not been able to reach us but as I mentioned you know this is a this this is something we are very aware of identity f is is quite a real challenge that we have to face um and they are significant control measures in place as well to try and prevent this uh we do have about two million applications so yes this is this is a real challenge um uh what they picked up is you know that people are committing identity theft and they are making uh um uh making false applications with with people's IDs uh there are police investigations as well currently running on this there's Court proceedings happening in one of my colleagues is in court today uh with one of the suspects that have been arrested um and and so this is something that is happening but we do believe we our control measures um that we've put in place are quite stringent we don't support the sort of suggestions that the students on ground up is making that we should reboot the system we do have U quite sophisticated algorithms that run in the background um that that tries to pick up uh uh uh cases where fraud is being committed we then suspend those applications um but obviously we can't say for sure that that is fraud until the actual victim of identity comes forward and confirms that that was not the application um we also in discussion we also had discussion together with the national treasury with some of the banks that we picked up um where where false frent accounts are being opened um many of them are addressing that strengthen their F process that is also something that's very worrying to us that people can uh you know that that there's some slack in the processes that Banks some banks apply not all the banks but there are some banks that that use very weakly the process that allows uh uh students like Joel and and quite a few as mentioned we've got over 2 million applications that's currently blocked um where where where we suspect that that identity C has happened okay two things two things from what you've just uh said um Mr fanera firstly uh you mentioned earlier that um you know ground up has been reporting about this since last year so according to Sasa what is the scale of the fraud being perpetrated as it pertains to identity theft um when and the SRD Grant where were you able to establish that yes so as as I mentioned we've got about 2 million applications which we suspect and we can't definitively say it's fraud um because a lot of clients have to come forward and and and unblock their accounts so when we so we've got about 2 million applications that we've suspended um uh because we suspect that that those could have been fraudulently made um and when a client does that so as as for example Joel says these ID is one of those IDs you then have to call our call center what what they will then send you a a a link where you then have to do a faal biometric uh to confirm your identity if you confirm your identity we then unlock the application and and process it further for for depending whether you qualify or not the other thing that you mentioned Mr fan frea is that people must come forward if they suspect you know that their identity um numbers are being fraudulently used but but how would people know someone could be using my ID number how would I know that this is happening so if if you well you come for if you needed a gr if you don't need a grant your number will just remain blocked um on our system and that that that application will eventually be cancelled so we we've got a process or or basically by law we are allowed to to cancel applications after a period of six months once we've we've put out the necessary Communications you so so when we suspect you have committed fraud we would then send send you a message saying please and because we don't know so we don't we suspect you commit a thr we would send you a message um saying you need to go through this process to to unblock your account because you you well we won't necessarily tell you FR but we'll just tell you you need to do this to to to to finalize your application if you come if you're a genuine person you come forward and you would unlock your account and and that process would complete itself uh and if not over process of time we then um delete your application however we do also acknowledge challenges that we currently have noting the client base that you serve and if you look as I mentioned you look at most the complaints of course of the last year is that the systems are too stringent but again you got to balance the risk of fraud versus accessibility to our clients which I think was something I commend the students for as well acknowledge in their person view that you that that one also has to to to to to to make your system accessible so we haven't quite implemented the cancelling of applications yet because we because the B identification that we the clients have to do requires you um to get a smart ID so people would first have to go to Home Affairs get a smart ID if they still using a green book um and that process may take a little bit longer than for many clients to be able to unlock their accounts so we've been a little bit accommodating in that aspect to to to not necessarily then cancel an application um to still allow people on um who may be genuine applicants to come forward and and unlock their accounts um yeah thanks so that not withstanding um V gai you know speaking to the system that uh Sasa uses you guys have been able to get into that system and quite easily by that it seems so talk to us about what you found in that regard and the weaknesses that you believe Sasa ought to be aware of um first thing I want to say is we did not get into the the system rather we we discovered Sasa used a a very um badly designed way to to test for for ID numbers that was publicly available um and and when testing the system I want to just give you a little bit of the data we we tested all 300,000 uh possible IDs for for February 2005 born individuals and what we ended up finding was about 74,000 positive active applications um available and and and when we check the latest stsa report the 2020 report there were only about 84,000 people born in that month and and this correlates to about a 91% application rate uh among the people born in February 2005 when we take a look at unemployment statistics for for the Youth it's at about 60% and and you know it's important to to take note that that that that disparity of about 30 % is highly concerning um I just want to talk a little bit about the the the systems that are in place at Sasa and and when we look at it you know um thank you Brenton for bringing up the fact that we can call in and that we can you know resolve um like issues like this but I I fail to believe that the systems in place are actually working because in Joel cedra's case um we phoned we we we did what a normal citizen um is expected to do and um we we we don't believe Sasa is is able to keep uh sorry we don't believe Sasa is able to handle the influx of of users and it's very problematic then to say we we should not cancel the system when Joel's current Sasa Grant and my active Sasa Grant are still not registered on my own phone number you cannot have a system in place which only verifies main surname and ID number in order to open up an application um Mr Brenton U fanera your response to that because and I think importantly what um VI Guai says there they went through the process that any ordinary South African would need to walk through in trying to reach Sasa not sabc news calling uh you know or groundup calling but just an ordinary South African and what the they are told to do in order to get in touch with you thanks so so yes jool is correct as I mentioned we've got over two million applications um blocked at the moment um and and you can imagine that is a large amount for our call center to deal with in terms of clients coming forward hence I mentioned previously that even though we are allowed to cancel applications after after six months we haven't necessarily implemented that yet because we do know that you know there's a challenge that people uh but of all as mentioned it's it's a challenge for people first to get their smart IDs through home Affairs which may take a bit of time plus as well the resource constraints on our side for them to get through to us so so we do keep that system open as well however noting Jo Joel and here that you coming from a different place not necess not necessarily the customer's place but but from a sort of ethical hacking point of view um and that's the different standard that you need to be held to um sorry but that said I kind of lost the questions againat it for me again well um we were basically talking about the systems that you use and of course you know in terms of getting back to uh clients when they do raise concerns but we also running out of time so let's quickly wrap this so justly on the systems right so yes uh we we got to so our front portal which is just the website right that that that allows for easy access the most information and I think VI mentioned is that what they've done is being able to access whether or not active application is is is available on that person's name noting though they did not get ID numbers Etc from us they got that by hacking a third party Source um so they would have gotten the ID numbers as well as the telephone numbers used for the applications from a third party source would not have gotten that from us um and you need that two combinations to be able to check an application and the most you'd find out from that is whether or not active application is is available if you wanted more information you then have to also respond to an OT you would get an OTP uh which would be sent to that cell phone number on this you actually add that cell phone number to get the more detailed information uh you would you would need you would need the actual cell phone number to get an OTP um um so again it's about balancing access noting that we've got over 16 million clients that engages with our system on a monthly basis there's no way we can put rate limits on that so for example they ran 700 I think it was 700 a day or something like that correct um if we blocked it at 700 imagine we've got 16 million people interacting with our website that means a lot of people would not have access to our website uh this is the active gr you you know people are logging on every month check their status to verify things so we can't put rate limits and stuff like that which you suggesting onto our website is just it would just block access for millions of people and make their life a lot more difficult um but I can guarantee you that our back end systems are extremely secure um so yes maybe if you've harnessed people's ID numbers from another source and use them to check to to to check their details you in other words you've already committed a crime by stealing someone's identity um you might gain limited information about whether or not that person have an active application that's unfortunately is all we have time for but uh Brenton fan fra executive manager at Grant Administration Sasa and VI Kasai first year geoinformatics student majoring in computer science at stanos University uh thank you so much for your time and of course raising a very important issue that I'm sure many South Africans are affected by speaking us to us there about uh what they have found V and his partner about sasa's SRD grants"
7yo5e8Sgnn0,DBE Minister Gwarube on a Listening and Learning Tour in Free State,2024-10-17T07:05:48Z,832,basic education Minister C guahu and Deputy Minister rajina are in bloom Fontaine in the Free State as part of the ongoing National listening and learning tour now they will engage with the provincial leadership to discuss educational challenges and solutions unique to the province challenges include scholar transport and um in rural areas in particular so to give us an update on this story is our colleague ishal MBA ishal good morning so interest in development this in terms of the minister going from Province to Province uh to get an I suppose a sense for herself the realities of what the education system is dealing with at ground level indeed good morning Sakina that is the situation where the minister is going Province to Province if I'm not mistaken this is the sixth Province where the minister is going through this tour of Les learning and listening but without wasting time because she has been waiting for for such a long time she still has a meeting to conduct Minister let let us just step into the discussion and speak about the purpose of this um listening and learning tour that you are undertaking what have you uncovered so far and what is the basis or the purpose of this to thank you so much it's uh very good to be in the Free State this morning this is our seventh stop um across the provinces and I'm joined today by the MC and her incredible team and um look there are certain things that are common in most of the provinces uh number one the issue around budget cuts is a big problem that's affecting all provinces in fact the Mec and I were discussing just now about the fact that um how do we make sure that we we we sort out inefficiencies in the system because our real goal is to make sure that we protect Frontline Services we want to protect teachers and make sure that there's a teacher in every classroom that we are keeping the ratio of Learners and Educators at as low as possible because we know overcrowding in schools in particular will affect the outcomes of education at the end of the day so those are some of the things we are seeing infrastructure is also a very common theme I'm going to be going around the province today h i know that they are not specifically one of the provinces that are affected necessarily by uh issues around pit toilets as such um in the backlog that we need to deal with but infrastructure is a huge problem whether it's maintenance of infrastructure whether it's appropriate sanitation whether it's building of new schools we know know that this is a huge Achilles heill for us as a sector and then of course issues around school safety we've been dealing now I know that you were talking about the issue around uh food poisoning um and while these incidents we've we've been in fact having a discussion with the MC now that these incidents have are are isolated and not necessarily taking place within our schools but I've sought to engage with the minister of Health to say how do we get him and his team to perhaps do greater uh uh oversight particularly with the vendors that sell to school children just outside of schools but we're also asking municipalities to assist us because of course this is a municipal function to make sure that those who are selling food and those who are vendors um are in fact uh abiding by uh the the health and safety mechanisms that are there yesterday I was listening to one of the parent atanga saying that he's is a parent and a member of the sgb saying parents let's stop giving this children money to buy because at schools they are being provided where is the where where is the the gaps on the loops hole because we are seeing these numbers and we are seeing rightly so it's it's an isolated thing but it looks like the numbers are going looking at the numbers that were reported in yet yesterday in panga of course I mean we we lost five Learners um in Ken so this is a crisis that we're not taking to taking um lightly because I mean these are five Learners that have lost their lives and so it's it's incredibly serious um I don't necessarily think that that the issue is around parents not necessarily giving their children money um I really think that there needs to be greater enforcement uh of bylaws uh that the cities and the municipalities need to look at um on our side we are making sure that the school nutrition program um is isolated from from these kind of uh food poisonings that's why we have to look after the the school nutrition program as much as possible 9.7 million children depend on that program and a lot of and for a lot of them that is the only meal that they will receive that day and so we have to look after it make sure that it's nutritious make sure that it is safe but also we have to make sure that this the the vendors in fact the MC I'd like to bring her in now where she was talking about some of the interventions she'd like to have around um the the the the people the entrepreneurs who are selling in schools M unfortunately Minister because of time we have to we have to wrap up that is the Min the minister of basic education C telling us outlining us the importance of having a proper food nutrition saying 9.7 million of children in South Africa rely on this and that's what we have with with the minister
S9g9XdKQpMQ,Marhagi Secondary School | Suspected food poisoning scare - Nonhlanhla Ntshingila reports,2024-10-17T07:03:20Z,2352,more than 20 Learners from maragi Secondary School in Verena in umum Malanga were rushed to the quam Sanga clinic and Hospital on suspected food poisoning after they complained of headaches stomach cramps and some began vomiting now it's alleged that the Learners consumed acha at school we cross to our colleague nonant Chila who's there for us nonla good morning so uh one of several cases of suspected uh food poisoning and this of course in a week where we unfortunately saw the burial of six children five uh unfortunately on a s Sunday and of course another one who passed away later but talk to us about what's happening inum Malanga and what we are told the children consumed where and how uh it's a very good morning to you Sakina and the viewers at home this morning we are at Maki second school that is situated in vinaa section inanga according to the reports Sakina like you said 21 Learners uh consumed Archer yesterday and they were quickly rushed to Verina clinic and also Verina hospital but then fortunately enough all the 21 Learners they were discharged yesterday we got that confirmation from the head of communication uh in the Department of Education inanga jper zani uh those Learners Sakina they did present the symptoms like headache also vomiting and others were having stomach crems this uh the food poisoning thing is rather becoming a very serious issue because just yesterday we were speaking to theen Department of Education spokesperson whereby we were discussing the issue of food poisoning that has been happening in Hing and only to find out that later on we're going to get a case that is also confirmed inanga but to hear more about this Sakina I will be joined by one of the parents who's going to take us through as to what really happened what time did the children eat the Archer and what happened afterwards I'll be joined by one of the parents Mr mang who will tell us more about what really happened uh Mr M to for dep uh Sakina that was one of the parent explaining as to what really happened and he did tell us that uh he got a call from the school telling him that uh his child has been admitted at one of the hospitals at guamanga when he got there the children were not in a very bad situation because they could walk on their own instead of being on the wheelchair and he says he would like the department to intervene uh because many children here they say it will be better if ever they do something different rather than giving them uh PB and milk they they rather give them something different but now with me I have um the district uh um spokesperson who's going to speak to us Mr dolas MAA who's going to give us the reaction as to what is the department saying about this thing because in other provinces there has been so many cases that has been reported fortunately enough this is the first incident that has been reported in bumarang but to get more information let's speak to uh dolas MAA who will tell us more about this uh Mr MAA can you please give us more information as to what uh do you know about the situation okay let's correct that I'm not the spokesperson I'm the district director um yes we we get this news round about uh 2:00 3:00 yesterday that Learners at the school at makak they were fainting they complain about the stomach cramps and they released is them uh the initial report was that we have 24 leers uh later by around about 5:00 at the hospital then we realized that we have 30 lers because the school released all the lers around about 1:00 uh when this incident happened and then some of the lers have already gone home so when they started to have those stomach crms then they went to the clinic and they were taken to the hospital so all of these lers have been have been uh a discharge uh we really want to appreciate the the Professional Care which was taken by the clinic here in Verena and by the Kanga hospital that they were able to treat these Learners even today we have the some of the Learners are back at school we have the the the psychosocial support from our district which will be looking at this particular Learners in terms of the support and say how can we assist them but we want to say parents the schools sgbs the school management team the parents must be vigilant uh uh the basic hygiene principle must apply uh must also have you said when leers before they eat they must have water they must wash their hands when they go to restroom they must also wash their hands that's why we are saying that the H the head of department will be issuing a circular to remind people about basic hygiene principles uh we cannot confirm what what caused the the foot poisoning what you have said we'll wait for the for the for the report from the Department of Health provincially to say what really happened uh we hear that they're saying it's a we we can't confirm what really happened but we know that this was an incident which really it is it's concerning so the prin the sgbs the smts must be vigilant in terms of hygiene at schools so we'll be able to remind people when we have our meetings with principals when we'll also remind them to say how they should take care of these Learners uh in terms of what the the parents have raised we got a stable diet for all the schools is the same so so obviously it's not the issue of the the the mil and up on on on on yesterday because it means it will have been the whole school so something was bought outside which created this situation so so we'll we'll deal with these issues because some we find that maybe are people who are selling we have to check in terms of hygiene and say how careful can be how Vigilant can be and even the Learners when they come to school we must be able to manage that particular part we'll also appeal to the parents to be able to to manage that particular process so that we don't have this incident okay thank you Mr M for your time uh Sakina that was Mr MAA for now we will keep on tracking the story as to what is really happening

DQiY2pcbUJo,Food Security | There's a lack of government intervention - Alan Browde  shares more,2024-10-16T21:33:26Z,2293,Su reaction CEO of sa Harvest Alan BR joins us for more expanding on this a very good evening to you alen thank you so much for your time I know that uh you have made some sort of impact or um effort to tackle malnutrition in South Africa because as we know according to UNICEF 23% of South African children live in severe food poverty hunger malnutrition at the Forefront and a daily reality for many what is this type of scenar Mario reflect well uh from our point of view and thank you for having me on the show uh from our point of view this reflects a lack of intervention uh by the government and this has gone on for many many years uh the fact that 27% of our children and we heard it earlier suffer from um severe malale nutrition stunting wasting and often irrevocable uh cognitive impairment the fact that this happens in a country which has food we're not at War we don't have famine we have a surplus of food and the fact that so many of our children suffer this this fate is really a crime against humanity as far as I'm concerned and we at sa Harvest we're a food rescue organization which rescues food that would have gone to waste and we deliver it to uh organizations that feed hungry people on a daily basis we understand that this need not happen uh we could make changes and the government if they got involved in a proper way and not just words could make very quick changes and at a deep level do you think it's a matter of um distribution or perhaps intervention to ensure that the model works that the surplus of food is accessed and and distributed uh accordingly well the the the fundamental problem in our country is that food is too expensive most of our people cannot afford to access nutritious food and the root cause of that really is a lack of government intervention M cuz when thec came into power for various reasons they extricated themselves from any involvement in the food ecosystem they let the market rule completely now in a country like ours in the developing country when you let the food market the food ecosystem uh alone you don't intervene in any way uh in the economics of it the powerful get more powerful and the weaker get weaker and we saw just before I came on the pictures of poor Farmers yeah small farmers who were obliterated by the uh phenomenon of our retailers getting more and more powerful now the retailers are in business they're interested in profit and one can't blame them for that that's the system but one has to control that one has to have um price controls and uh other measures that ensure that the small farmer um is empowered and that people are able to to buy food that is Affordable and nutritious food you know the theme of world food day is the right to the right food and the first right is obviously a constitutional thing and in South Africa our constitution is very strong on that sections 27 and 28 uh Express the fact that South Africans have the right to enough food all South Africans and that all South African children have the right to adequate nutritious food nutrition and that's not happening at all so the government hasn't fulfilled its obligations of section 27 and 28 and by doing so they will enable people to uh uh eat and not be hungry and also to not bear the the brunt of malnutritional malnutrition and the related diseases yeah we heard agriculture Minister John Steen haen speaking today and he says that ensuring that South Africa South Africans have food on the table that would need collaboration government and the private sector need to work together I mean how attainable is that you speak about the ecosystem and some of the loopholes within it yeah it's very attainable and I must say to you that uh uh Minister uh stanos has to be commended for breaking open this uh information that has really been a sort of secretive um Affair in South Africa's history and he's broken it open he's shown that 63% of our households suffer from severe food vulnerability and this hasn't been spoken about and yes you're right collaboration is required we in the in the uh Civil Society space and in the NGO space we do whatever we can I mean sa Harvest uh my NGO has in five years delivered uh just short of 80 million meals it's it's uh really something that we're proud of but we need so much more and the collaboration is right but the government has to lead it in action not in words and I would appeal now to the minister of Agriculture who's done so well to translate the words and the reports and the data and information into action and there are actions they can take now that would make a huge difference very quickly in our country to end Hunger very well thank you so much for speaking to us this evening we are going to have it to leave it there C of sa Harvest alen broer there joining us and expanding as we reflect on food insecurity in the country its impact and of course affecting the most vulnerable

that a day like this will have to to come at some point you know so we celebrated our anniversary last week on the 9th of October uh part of the reasons why I would not have agreed to take up a position of being a public representative and going back to represent my party thec in the National Assembly was to make sure that I deal with this because this case has been going on for quite some time yeah we have made representations to the special investigating unit so I would have wanted to avoid the embarrassment of having to H have to step aside resign from Parliament and uh you know have all of the that's why it was important for me to immediately convey to the public my position to step aside as a member of to step aside from the national executive committee until such time that the charges preferred against me which I deem to be serious are ventilated successfully in court because I have again today pronounced on my innocence I've already telephoned the Secretary General of the ANC comrade fig Bala over the weekend to convey my intentions at the time I was not charged so it would have been premature to take any decision as soon as this happens two things now have to happen I have to step aside from my position it's national executive committee member of the NC and uh all other related responsibilities I also intend writing to the Integrity Committee of thec to advise them in accordance with that resolution of thec that I would want to appear before them just to give them a high level view of what this case entails and what our position is without necessarily descending into the arena to a point of even disclosing what will constitute our defense because that falls within the area of sub judicate as you speak about um the the SG having telephonically spoken to him at the weekend he has has responded speaking to to sabc saying that he welcomes the decision and that you're Duty bound and that a statement will later follow yes is it a matter of Duty or principle for you well it's both it's both you know uh one it's a matter of Duty it's also a matter of principle uh I have been a member of the African National Congress for over 30 years and in the 30 years that I've been a member of the African National Congress earlier on when I started I would have been part of the thec Pioneer movement I Rose to lead thec youth league for two consecutive terms as Treasurer general of the ANC yeah I now leading the national executive committee of thec for near three terms meaning for almost 15 years and in all of these periods I would have been part of uh structures of thec in the form of ngc's policy conferences and national conferences that affirmed a set of resolutions part of those sought to speak to the renewal of thec was that those indicted to appear in a court of law must do the right of the right thing which is to step aside from their responsibility as part of allowing A Renewed ANC to be able to find itself so doing this is not in any way or form a pronouncement of guilt on my part it is a commitment a steadfastness towards living up to that principle we can't go to conferences adopt principles and yet we ourselves as leaders in the Apex structure of the organization find it difficult to live through that which we say our lower structures must be able to implement must an embodiment of those are you speaking on on a tone of regret I mean as you go through all of this it sounds like you're rehashing and just really speaking out of regret is that the case no no no what okay if I was speaking on a tone of regret like you are suggesting what will I be regretting well you know you were right when you said that these charges against you are quite serious I mean the allegations for one nirro Moi did not declare that you were its owner you were still a member of parliament during the investigation by the SIU it was found that your company had misrepresented itself during the bidding process for the 27 million Rand tender I mean that in itself how do you justify it can I clarify that look please look to the extent that it's not well the sabc is not a space to say whether this is accurate or not of safe to say that ER very early in the first quarter of 2017 I would already have advised the leadership of thec of my intentions to resign as a member of the National Assembly so the period in question where declaration would have needed to be made you only declare when you're a member of parliament so by the time those Declarations of that period would have needed to be made at that point I would have long made my decision to leave Parliament so how do you how do you how do you make declarations about H working elsewhere uh when we are no longer working at the sabc because uh in the very first quarter of 2017 I would already have declared that but again this is an ethical question yeah it's an ethical question in the sense that you see uh these are matters of government we have to really separate that which is an an ethical construct and that which is a criminal construct so the Declarations in Parliament have got to do with the moral standing of leaders who are public representatives to show the public that they are of good standing and all of that I have never at any given time ER not pronounced on my association with enir Mobi the only reason I would have resigned as a director of enir Mobi was merely because I was going to take up a position as a member of parliament I've never concealed my participation more so because the innovation in question which is part of this whole issue that we are dealing with it's an innovation that I constructed myself the Environ mob Innovation is written by me I'm the patent holder so now I can't I can't regret for innovating that which goes on to create employment but also I can't stop State institutions from arriving at conclusions that there may be a case of criminality here worth being responded to yeah but but but it also gets worse bule it gets really worse here when we look at the main contention of the npa's case as detailed in the charge seat it's it speaks about the 27.5 U million prepayments the provinal uh provincial government Department made to your company for what the state is claiming yes is a breach of contracts I mean you you're justifying that um and but like it it gets worse and money for work not done Services were not rendered the allegation in itself um just rubbed salt in the wound how did you get paid to begin with if if Services were not rendered I think uh and thanks again for inviting me because uh an important platform such as the sabc Accord me the opportunity to clarify your good your good viewers back at home um when the case is being ventilated in court ER which is at now even in on trial uh it will one of the things that will be shared with yourselves because remember all this these are allegations yes so so so so to rebert this these are going to be rebutted with facts mhm if you say things are not were not being delivered you'll have to say what was not delivered for instance I can tell you now for free and I can place this on record 200 motorized vehicles have been delivered today the SIU in their own Vision only pointed to H some 100 OD um some 196 that was delivered according to themselves actually only four are still outstanding so now let me place it on record the 200 has been delivered those delivery slips are there they were shared with the relevant bodies in this instance they would have been shared with the relevant government Department there's never been a point uh where there was question about the delivery so I'm not sure which part of n is this one because I tell you why why I made mention of that because you had a contractual agreement between the department and your company which stipulated that the department had to consider paying on condition 50% of the work that had been completed up and upfront payments made were made to you yes but remember before that but remember these are allegations that are being made I hear you I'm telling you the basis of the question I am so so but remember cons respectfully so to you and understanding that you are simply reading a church sheet yes so I am saying to you when the church sheet is presented in court at trial we will prove through evidence uh that a number of those things that you are raising as allegations would have been clarified at the time that the performance of that action called payment took place so so so but this will be clarified in court remember it won't change whether I say it here the Sac or I say it in court it won't change I can tell you this the was delivery of the vehicles and and if if you talk prepayment as a matter of principle a prepayment h would constitute ER an audit irregularity it could be fruitless what but it it will not so so if you and I agree just so that we work together if we agree that prepayment does not constitute a crime it will constitute an audit irregularity in terms of accounting terms but we'll get to that when we deal with those so I'm just saying so that we don't find ourselves using a simple accounting process and making it look like a criminal activity n declaration like I was saying to you whether I declared or or not let's pack that n declaration is a moral duty declaration is a moral issue it's an ethical case if a member of parliament has not declared certain of his interests and those are later discovered they are then taken to the Ethics Committee and then they have to explain if the Ethics Committee is not satisfied with their explanation there will then be a sanction issued against such a member so so basically just so that I want us to shift on this one so that we can move h prepayment as well as declaration these two fall within one Falls within the realm of eth ethical conduct the other one Falls within the realm of accounting practices okay so that gives us an indication on your line uh and your position as you take this matter up and head back to court to to ventilate it unfortunately I would have liked to to squeeze in uh if they'll allow me uh because for the sake of time you are suggest it's suggested here thank you that uh you were issued a letter of demand to the department uh wanting further payment of over 9 million R for safekeeping storage and andary services relating to the fleet is that true yes I'm sure you are referring to the juristic person yes so of course the juristic person in the form of enviral Mobi would have done that and based on subsequent legal opinions that the department would have received uh the parties to the best of my knowledge agree to settle at just over 6 million and some some couple hundreds of thousands because one there would have been that safekeeping would have meant that this H motorized three-wheelers would have been kept in storage for an extended period of time which the department did not anticipate had the department anticipated that as I procure this motorized three this this this motorized vehicles H I will also provide this place so that they could be stored so obviously I mean you know it with yourself I mean uh when you keep a car with mechanics or anywhere if you keep a car for a long time you are liable to pay storage costs because if something happens to that car while it is in the care of those uh mechanics it will have to be their duty to fix the car for instance at one instance there was a case of hail storm when there was that case of hail storm when even when that provision was not even made initially the cars had to be fixed but you see the most important thing so that we do not just reduce this engagement to this technical issues we also have to mention that that there's also human interest here the human interest has got to do with the many beneficiaries H who were the expect who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of a project like this so basically when you stalled the roll out of a project I mean one there was a project launch meaning that the project existed two there are people who were trained I mean former Premier comrade makura the former MC of J the former MC of J comrade all of them in one way or the other participated in the roll out of the project either by way of heading out learner licenses by way of handing out the motorized three-wheelers themselves or by way of launching the project this things are part of public record importantly is that jat even went as far as going out and Publishing a Gazette on a on a on a waste management plan for the informal waste sector using exactly the model that envirom Mobi would have put forward of this motorized three-wheelers so there's a story of innovations that we should not be scared to stand on the side of Innovations that contribute to socio economic transformation in our country we should not be scared to do that but we must also know that that might also come with us paying a huge price including with our own personal Liberties but when that happens because in court what wins is facts we have to place before the public the relevant facts of what who against you no I'm I'm I'm one person who don't even believe that witches go out hunting I don't do that you they are Hunters Hunters are real Hunters don't so so so I'm just saying in my language no no no this so now I don't I don't believe that there is a any undue thing and all of that if there is if there is any unw dealing here it will expose itself as the case goes on this case is is now before a court of law mhm we have to be lawful in our dealing with a case such as this and I must commend the law enforcement agencies the prosecution on how they've been handling the matter till this far having a day in court allows me the fellow accused my family to be able to clear and place our vision on record okay because if we don't do that you would imagine this I mean I would have gone and been a member of parliament now but I had to restrain myself because I know that they are certain of these things that have got to be addressed you know but unfortunately if you don't address those things and you just tell yourself that it doesn't happen like that okay so you were thinking ahead of time but in the the gist of the matter you're sticking to your story um you have done nothing wrong and the courts will have to prove it and show for it come come Court well of course I mean we pronounced on our guilt we pronounced on our guilt and we will share with the court our understanding of this case and we'll also share with the court how a case such as this has effectively compromised what could have been benefits to the many way speakers the people that you pass on the streets pulling the troles these are people who are supposed these are way speakers they are people who are supposed to be beneficiaries of some of this Innovations they wrote themselves and they took to social media a year or so ago saying that they will drive the Kikis and go to court we to say to them no it's not necessary because there was one time where there was a big ER SIU bruha around this whole thing so he said no it's not necessary we will go and put forward a vision and we'll put a vision which we believe is factual yes so we don't want at this stage to really delve into H the merits and Demars who's the complainant whether such a complainant has got a local standy what motivated the initial placing of this complaint what was wrong now now because any any reasonable viewer would ask themselves but because the cars have been delivered let's say we go with the state VIs that only four cars have not have not been delivered then a fa viewer will ask what is the problem here well the red flags couldn't have been ignored in terms of processes I mean what they speaking here are things we can't ignore we can't ignore that they feel that uh you your company was not open about you being being the owner of the company that that no but but you see you see that that's that's why I'm coming that if you say the red flags we then have to establish MH who that's why I'm saying we have to establish who who is this complainant at what point did they complain if you talk about red Flex when did this red Flex come come about who picked up this red Flex what was the role of this ones who picked up the red Flex we have to understand all of that because because you see by the way I mean our government in this country has not reached a level where things are done by robotics these things were done by human beings so so so so these are professionals men and women of Integrity they will be able to clarify because well a larger part of the things that you are asking to be fair to to to inv virro mob which I'm not representing here really have got to do with jat they don't have anything because number one H service providers don't pay themselves they are paid by government and service providers are paid based on the compact they will have with the government Department that is an arrangement so now you see I I I I almost you know overreached in the sense that I went into a space that effectively is not our space I'm supposed to be dealing to the best of my knowledge questions that might have to do with en virro Mobi and where I knew but what I'm aware of is that here was an innovation being implemented working with jat to try and deal with h i have to consider that you were a spokesperson for many years and we're going to go around in circles because no but we're not no no we we're going to because um the point is not the project itself and the value of the project it's more complex than that but we we're going to have to leave it here um you were a spokesperson for many years you and I could speak until the show is over let me thank you for your time I do thank you no but but but let me make a parting short uh look I'm not taking anything away from you and I'm not taking the seriousness I'm not watering down the seriousness of the questions that you are asking I'm not responding on those questions using the artifact of having been a spokesperson I'm sharing with you the facts as I know them yes to your to your understanding yes so so so but we will we will further amplify these issues when they are best ventilated in court absolutely I do thank you for your time no thanks uh we're going to have to leave it there joining us in studio there just clarifying a few pointers there regarding the appearance of course in court and the accusations at hand"
V2wZ7OpGK5A,EFF demands release of IFMS report - Omphile Maotwe weighs in,2024-10-16T20:48:08Z,15820,welcome back the eff has called on President SRA ramapa to release the investigative report on the corruption fraud and maladministration concerning a 1 billion Rand contract for the integrated financial management system the contract awarded in the 2017 Financial year involved the purchase of a system from Oracle with Promises of integration and improvements in Municipal finances e Treasurer General umil joins us now to expand on this a very good evening to you thank you so much for your time you make this call after the auditor General's findings talk to us about some of your concerns yeah good evening to you good evening to the viewers at home so yesterday we had a standing committee meeting on finance and uh the agsa tabled a report that audits entities that are falling under the national Treasury and one of the findings were that there was a material finding that was issued by by the agsa in relation to the contract that was awarded to Oracle and when we asked them what was the medial irregularity that they found they said it's it relates to the integrated financial management system so today in our meeting with a treasury today then we asked because they said aitor General we asked them why is it not appearing in the current um in the past Financial year the audited financial statements and they said that it's because treasury issued a note that says the previous findings should be removed from the audit financial statement should appear only on the annual report so luckily today we're dealing with the annual report of national Treasury and surprisingly that matter was not tabled by national treasury until we raised it with national treasury that yesterday we had the meeting and there's this material irregularity that was Finding by the agsa today 400 million but it doesn't appear here on your annual report which is an expectation that it should ainar appear and you know they they been about the bush they telling us stories and we said at the committee what exactly did you purchase and where is it tangible that we can see with the system and even the chair of the committee um Dr joas swangang said today on record that they actually visited national Treasury and together with national treasury they went to ca to seek and look for this system that they talking about not even a server was found both a national Treasury and at CA when they called Oracle to say Oracle where is the software that has been purchased and who is hosting it Oracle said no it's in the cloud now the contract was a 1 billion R contract yeah 400 million has been spent nothing can be shown for it when we ask the DG Dr Duncan what is happening with this issue he says no um it's a materal irregularity and they're taking the the report on review because after agsa made that finding they then referred the matter to the SIU to investigate SIU said according to Dr dcan said last year already when they were doing the preliminary report that there is something that they see and they would really want National treasury to take this matter forward the report was then finalized in March this year 2024 and was sent to the president Sosa in May 2024 that says that indeed there are elements of Corruption of fraud that they are detecting with this um issue now our issue is that there is agsa saying to National treasury National treasury there is something wrong that we are seeing here and we want this matter to be investigated further then it takes it to SIU SIU reiterate what agsa was saying that there is a case to be answered here and in the report according to uh the the the because we asked the DG why are you taking this report on review money has been spent of the taxpayers now you want to incare more money by taking this thing on because you're going to use lawyers to defend what exactly are you defending he says there are three things one is that the former DG according to the report it it it recommends that the former DG must be criminally charged that's number one number two the report says that there are technical misunderstandings H that are being seen in the in the whole contract now our question is when D you only appointed last year you are not part of these things so why does it seem like you want to really cover cover up corruption why you not letting go of this and then Mr Rapa the president must release the report the SIU must then hand over this report H for for persecution because people must go to court and answer for themselves if the DG is not corrupt or the officials of national treasury are not corrupt why are they hiding it they buying Time by taking this met on review knowing very well that this matter might take a couple of years to be finalized and what has been the ripple effect what do you think the ripple effect of such a matter and the amount of money that has already been spent if we have a reality check more so looking at Municipal Financial Management Systems how they've collapsed and of course uh is there enough to draw a correlation just looking at what the current situation is and how there seems to be no sense of accountability at this point so that is exactly our issue that municipalities have collapsed um the the the reporting the money is you don't have an integrated system that is able to be used as a tool to effectively and efficiently manage the resources of South Africa but what is also more concerning EMP this is 400 million we talking about nothing literally nothing so how is National treasur different from all these other municipalities where money has been spent but you've got nothing to show for it and when agsa says hang on there is something wrong here it is the same National treasury that is now taking the matter on review we said to them agsa says there is an issue let's refer the matter to SIU the matter gets referred to another body independent body investigating unit the investigating unit says no we actually agree with hgsa there is something that must be looked into here who are you National Trier to come and say no there's technical misinformation and you can't say the former DG must criminally charged who who should be held to account who is National treasury protecting here what is your assertion when you talk about corrupt individuals who are you talking about so the officials of national treasury know exactly what there's no way that money to the tune of 400 million can be spent there are invoices that they paid clearly the money came out of national treasury propers through the officials of national treasury it didn't fall from the sky so National treasury authorized these payments now we ought to know why were these payments authorized because there's nothing to show for the chair person of the Committee reported on record today and when we spoke to the DG we even said to him the chair was not speaking in his personal capacity he was speaking in his capacity as a chairperson of the committee because remember Dr masong was the chairperson of the committee in the six Administration so he didn't visit National Treasury and s in his own capacity he visited the S Parliament so Parliament says to you DG we went and checked there is no system there is no computer there is no server there's nothing that you can show for it even CA said to Parliament through the standing committee on finance at that time that we don't know what you're talking about that thing doesn't exist here so exactly why is NA national treasury being told okay show us what you're talking about they can't show it but they want to take the the the the the report on review what has been the presidency's response to to the release of the investigative report I mean is there an indication of a timeline time frame when when is this bound to happen so as the committee today at least we resolved on two things that we are going to go to the president that they release the report of the SIU and allow the matter to take its legal CA that's what because you can also ask yourself may we are now in October why is the president president silent why is the president not releasing the report that's one two is that um we as the citizens of this country it should be concerning to all of us to say how can the custodian of our funds be the one fingered now into corruption we are very quick to go around saying municipalities and legislators and officials and everybody we pointed out Point them out to be corrupt but here is the elephant in the room the very custodian of our funds is now fingered into the St so we want the release of the the the the the report but also most importantly is that there the committee resolved because the national treasury was saying they are now going to resuscitate the talks with Oracle to see what they can salvage in the money that they've already paid meaning they're going to renegotiate with with Oracle to say look 400 million has been paid can you at least do something why would you do that if you are innocent to say why why is National treasury not concern so as the committee we resolved that there will be no communication with Oracle in terms of resuming the implementation of this project until they come and sit in front of the committee and we go and interrogate exactly what happened to the 400 million maybe we are talking about this it's it's not even 400 million it's more than that of course the agsa said because the material ularity was found in the previous years there hasn't been any payment that was made after in the previous Financial year that is why it is not showing in the previous Financial year but our concern Bo is that the matter did not come in forward in the annual report if it's a matter that concerns National Treasury and tral treasury is worried about having spend 400 million of the taxpayers money they should have put it in the report no they didn't instead they tell us that it's it's down there in the report it's not in the presentation is somewhere in page 299 why would such a big amount of money be hidden somewhere inside the report something that that props up in the main report that they presented today there are more questions than answers but uh we we do thank you for for your time and of course hoping to get to the bottom of that eff Treasurer General umil we expanding on that and asking a lot of questions here about accountability and what happened to the 400 million Rand for

HloeCMTKBAw,Maiden SA Food Security Index 2024,2024-10-16T18:17:02Z,438,a combination of climate change impacts and geopolitical Rumblings have served to tighten the global supply of food and thus pushing up its price and this became more Stark in 2023 just after Russia began its war on Ukraine when a multiple of commodity prices surged resulting in many parts of the global economy experiencing 40-year High inflation levels currently we got a double issue we've got we're still in the throws of Alo and we also have the external pressures coming from the international markets that there are food availability is a problem from the international markets and this is also because of geopolitical and climate change pressures combined this means that availability is a real problem there is constraints and it means that food costs more Professor Von fintel says the higher cost of food meant households having to buy cheaper Foods or less food and in turn compromising on their nutritional needs and noted that stunted growth among children had become a serious issue we're particularly concerned about stunting um South Africa about one in four children are stunted um which means they're too short for their age so but it's not just a physical thing stunting often uh predicts what happens into the future the it's a good proxy for nutritional status in other words do children have the right diets and nutrition to be able to perform at school and and to be able to eventually get a good job this has really long run consequences to have the right basket of nutrition and the right types of foods the professor noted that historically social grants had been important in enabling households to buy affordable nutritious food but that had become less of a case now with the higher cost of living he says that the first thousand days of a young child's life is crucial in terms of their access to good nutritional food and suggests that they may need to be governmental interventions to address the growing problem of a lack of access to nutritional food by some households the first things one could think of doing is is looking at early childhood development facilities and thinking of feeding programs there and the other thing is is looking at a key basket of very highly nutritious foods which are cheap enough for poorer households to afford to think of the discussions around zero rating and and being able to make these nutritious Foods also more affordable not just other Foods in general the contributors to the South African food security index warn that if material interventions don't take place to deal with hunger in the country through collaborative efforts between government and other role players there's a risk that the index will continue on its declining path NBA sabc news Johannesburg for

X3RPU5dKhGM,Deadline to update Eskom prepaid meters,2024-10-16T18:08:04Z,4626,time to update escom prepaid electricity meters is fast running out if not updated soon they may become non-operational before the end of next month the power utilities Dey Mna joins us to discuss the program of pre-coding their prepaid meters good evening Dey thank you very much for joining us on the program now the 24th of November deadline is fast approaching before we get to the data of how many prepaid meter users have already recorded their meters let's start with exactly why this program had to be rolled out uh good evening um fund and good evening to your viewers and thank you for having me yeah so the uh prepaid meter recoding it's really approaching um the deadline which is the 24th of November 2024 and the reason why we are reminding customers um to actually ensure that they um record their meters it's because on the 24th of November nober or beyond the 24th of November 2024 they will not be able to um upload um any tokens uh or credit tokens so they they run a risk of um having no Supply Beyond or on the 24th and Beyond and basically um having a black Christmas because um obviously the 24th is not far from uh the 25th of December mhm now is there a distinction made between the pre PR Aid meter users who are escom customers and those who are municipality customers or all prepaid meter users must uh pre-code or recode their meters so it's a certain type of of prepaid meters that needed to to be recoded or that are expiring on the 24th of November 2024 however in as far as escom all our prepaid customers are on this system and they require uh we require that they do recode uh their because it is a simple process um which is basically it requires a customer to just go and buy a token and once he buys the token they get the codes that are required for them to just upload on their or punch in on their meters and then um their meters will be um recoded and they won't be experiencing um switch off or mhm is this explained paron me for interjecting is this explained by the vendors that Beyond just buying your token there's this specific number that you must also enter which will allow your meter to be updated yes uh definitely so normally when the customer goes and buy a credit token or top up uh top up tops up his or her meter he he normally receives a 20 digigit number so in this case the customers will receive two additional 20 digigit numbers that they need to upload first before they can upload their credit token which is what they would have bought at the time MH and how has the uptake been how many prepaid meters have been recorded now so we've got about 6.6 uh I mean 4 million um that um have been uploaded and we would like to thank actually the provinces in uh the Western Cape customers and customers in northan cape and Free State because they are almost um we almost complete um with those Pro uh Pro um customers in terms of the program but we're still having customers like K thatn and in Hing that we still have a bit of a high number which is a concern that we need still that still need to uh go and buy from legal vendors and upload their meters so that we can have um or they can have their meters uh recoded and and they don't experience what um we anticipate on the 24th of November that one if they haven't uploaded their meters or loaded those two 20 digigit uh uh tokens or I mean digit numbers then their meters um won't be able to receive any uh token that they would have bought um Beyond 24th November 2024 so we are encouraging customers in Limpopo in hen in in and in liop in in K to go and in numbers out there to go and buy from legal vendors and legal vendors we are referring to your shop price we are referring to all the authorized vendors even spasa shops that are registered with escom uh once they've bought those meter I mean they've they they they top up their meter they will get those two 20 digigit numbers that just requires them to just upload or punch in as normal H they their that 20 digigit number and once they have uploaded those 20 digigit number they can upload their credit token and waa their meters will be um upgraded and they won um experience any any um uh Darkness beyond the 24th of November defy what of those who use banking apps will the app dispense this code as well or how does it work there yeah uh this includes also all those customers that are buy are buying online using their banking apps so they can also just um upload their meters buying um uh their their credit token via their banking apps and they they will receive those two 20 digigit numbers and as I said that it's just a matter of punching in or uploading those 20 digigit numbers on your meter like you normally do with your credit token 20 digit number and you then uh complete that process by uploading or punching in your your credit token or um 20 digigit number and your meter will be upgraded uh to um the um current or the up or the krn 2 or what do we call the key revision number two MH definitely in the ideal World everyone would heit your call and make sure that they update for the 24th of November but what happens to those we know there'll always be some who miss that deadline would they still have an opportunity to go to a vendor and still be able to get that 20 digigit code Soo we encouraging that they do it now I mean we are less than 38 days before the 25th of November although from escom side we have prepared these meters so that um in case some of the customers do not go to um buy their credit to can at the legal vendors before the 24th of November they can still have an opportunity to upload but we don't want to experience um any you know um Rush Hour um uh uh to these um vendors where customers will be rushing to the vendors trying to up uh upload or buy these credit um I mean this uh or to buy from their legal vendors and you know cosing a traffic um issues so we saying while we still left with 38 days there's still time for you to you know um go and buy um from the legal vendors ensuring that at your at your leisure you have you know there's no cues long cues at your vendors uh you go and buy and you upload on your meter um those three digigit numbers that is starting with the two that will upgrade your meter and the last one will be crediting your meter to whatever that you would have bought M and then just as a final question you and I when we last spoke the utility was dealing with the 40% of prefa uh electricity meters that were discovered to be non- vending which of course speaks to the issue of widespread electricity meter fraud how are you addressing this so I'm for know we've been I'm sure you have been seeing that esom has been active on the ground doing Audits and disconnecting those customers that have not or that have actually bypassed their meters so that's part of the normal process that we follow and um also encouraging customers that they need to you know um those that are have um bypassed their meters encouraging them to you know you know show themselves up so that we can assist them so that they can um start you know following the the right and legal Pro process of ensuring that they buy from legal vendors they actually do not bypass their meter because of um the issues um the consequences of not doing the legal um following the legal route in terms of ensuring that you're getting um legal electricity the consequences are so we we still encouraging our customers educating them we on the ground for those that we have educated and they still do not you know um heat the call we are on the ground auditing our meters disconnecting those customers finding those customers that need to be fined and customers those that need to pay the fines are paying the fines but in terms of the process of actually um uh recoding the meters the customers that have actually gone through this process have been giving us you know um a b a good uh um H um feedback that this is actually they thought that this is quite a complex uh process but it is as simple as just punching the 20 digigit number as you punch in your um credit token numbers all right deie as always thank you very much for your time that's escom spokesperson Dey mwena speaking to us e
D-VTNO4JdN0,World Food Day | Finding solutions to global hunger,2024-10-16T17:46:30Z,358,let's speak now to Dr tulas Cabella who is a researcher with the African Center for food security at UK Zin and director of outcome mapping who joins us live now good evening to you Dr kab and thank you so much for your time in 2021 for example you wrote that to build a resilient and Equitable Society South Africa must prioritize not just feeding its people but nourishing them from before birth with healthy balanced diets let's reflect on a day like today for example how much of this would you say has happened given what we are hearing around the statistics thank you very much good morning to you and good morning to your listeners um I think from where I see it it's a it's a set it's a set day when you look at how much we still behind in terms of making sure that every person has every person everywhere has got access at all times to food and and not just food but nutritional food that is good for their dietary needs and nutritional um needs for a healthy lifestyle so if you look at the story that you've just you've just been airing you can see that a number of people still go hungry there's hunger and there's malnutrition and there's food insecurity all all around us and particularly for the younger generation especially children for the first thousand days which are very important for the formation of a human being so one would then ask is it because food is simply not being produced at a scale that is enough or are the deeper issues that are going on here I think not that I think I know there are deeper structural issues that that at play here the fact of the matter is that there's enough food in the world to feed everybody but the biggest problem is access to that food we know that South Africa we normally say that South Africa is a nation that is food at National is food secure at National level but food insecure at a household level that speaks to the issue of saying the food is there somewhere but not everybody can access it when they need it m and is it a challenge of infrastructure as well especially when you look at farmers and possibly the support they receive across the continent infrastructure plays a big a bigger part to that issue in terms of Distributing the food that's being produced by the by the farmers because infrastructure plays a role in the ability of the farmers to produce sufficient food or or produce food according to the potential of the land that they are farming but there's also a bigger issue other than just infrastructure cuz even if the food is moved closer to the people they still have to have enough money to afford that food that is just next door let's look at food production and the challenges particularly for small holder and medium-sized Farmers inclement weather um has also become a huge challenge in recent years how much of an impact has this had as well on the sector climate changes had a big impact on the sector which then also transcends to just beyond farmers and how and and the income that they lose because when there is not enough food that is being produced or when it becomes too expensive to produce the food invariably that that price increase will be passed on to the consumer which then makes food less accessible to to the majority of people who who do not have the way with us to actually access that food so climate change is a big factor that that is also contributing towards the woring food insecurity situation not just in South Africa but the world over so where do policy makers Focus now in order to try and ensure um that they you know protect every single stakeholder that's involved here including the very ordinary citizens I think at a policy level what we should be looking at particularly in the South afcan situation is to make sure that the households that are in the rural areas that have access to land should also be involved in agricultural activities if you look at what statistics releases year year every year in terms of how many households are involved in agriculture in the rural areas the number keeps going down but then the number of food insecure households is is increasing so there is a an inverse correlation between those two which means that people that have access to land and especially those that are even unemployed should be keeping themselves busy for lack of a better we with agricultural production to make sure that at least they have food at the household level and also policy should also focus on making sure that we produce the kind of food that we eat and also take us back to indigenous Foods or what people call traditional foods that we've neglected because there's a reason why our forefathers um subsistent on on that kind of food and that poses a a huge potential for us to to pull us out of food insecurity because most of the traditional foods are climate smart or drug tolerant so they can survive the vories of climate change that we seeing today and you raised such a critical point there ESP especially because right now you hear of you know food that we would have grown up on for example being now called a delicacy and simply not being available for the ordinary person or when it is some people are then making it so expensive because it is so difficult to access that as you say will deal with two challenges it will deal with a challenge of nutrition but it will also deal with what you're raising as well which would be the issue of ensuring that we deal with the unemployment crisis in the country interesting that you say that because there's a flip side to that coin the people let we are saying that you we've come from Generations that grw up from that food there's also a stigma attached to that food in urban areas that when people go back to what we call traditional cuisine or traditional foods there a stigma that people think it's a poor men's food which then is a and which is also a bit oxymoronic in the sense that the food is so expensive when you want to buy it like you said because it's been made into a daily case I think nutritional education is is required which is part of another policy intervention that that policy maker should look at that we should understand the value of the traditional foods and also encourage people to produce that because it also easily lears itself to be classified as organic because it's um input it's low it's got low input intensity in terms of production and drella as you talk about that I'm thinking about um you know sometimes in January when people will have a whole lot of hashtags around cabbage for example um as they're saying people are poor they don't have enough money to buy meat this month so certainly you can make it in different ways but this is a diet you can even have on any other day if you're educated about nutrition but how much support is also needed for you know someone who has landed in a rural area to then be able to not only produce it for their family but as you say have access to the market have access to take care of their family but also have access to make sure that you and I have it as well yeah I think that that's a very important point because if you look at this what we classify as most skate farmers in the rural areas they those that can produce enough food or more than enough for what they need they struggle to get to the market which goes back to the issue of infrastructure that you mention to say that moving your cabbage out of your small plot until it finds the market it's it takes a bit um a lot of effort on your part and then it makes the food expensive and people would rather choose what is must produced in large large commercial farms around them around the urban areas where they live so in terms of doing that we need to look go back and and encourage people to grow a diversity of crop so that we not all grow cabbages at the same time then we end up flooding the market and then killing the price for the cabbages which is what then serves as a dis incentive for Farmers to produce that because food insecurity is not just limited amount of food that's available but it's also the dietary diversity we let a lot of diversity in our diet if you look at what you eat on a daily basis I'm sure you can reduce it to about six ingredients that you keep playing around with on a weekly basis we're not as diverse as we ought to be given the the natural diversity that we have in this country and sometimes our children grow up without knowing exactly um you know that they can diversify their food with um some of the indigenous foods but also that you know there is um the other reality as well that maybe some provinces may be doing better than the others where would you say are the real problems and which provinces may be doing things better I think limo it comes to mind as a province that is trying its level best to actually make sure that it's producing food for its own for itself in terms of the provincial agricultural activity because even State sa figures show us that limo has got a higher number of households that are involved in agriculture Li and Pang which happen to be neighboring provinces but but other rural provinces like Yul natal and the and the the Eastern Cape and Northwest are not doing so well the Northwest you can almost understand because it's it's quite a dry province in terms of agricultural activi hence they end up focusing on livestock but guul Nal and the Eastern Cape should actually be doing much better than what they are doing now in terms of producing enough food for themselves but having said that people don't have to rely on only what they produce themselves we are not um this provinces are not countries that there there's export and excise that you pay to move things from one Province to another so we should be looking at the comparative and competitive advantages of each province and those provinces should focus on what they can produce then they will generate enough money to buy what they cannot Pro produce from the other provinces would you say there's a relation between um food insecurity as well as nature for example um some of the rivers that are not um you know kept well would you say there is a link there sorry you said link between foot insecurity and and and maybe like for example nature some of the rivers for example who are not well kept and that impacts on the issues around water would you say there could be links here as well there's definitely a link with how we manage we manage the environment in fact it goes beyond even just Rivers simple things that farmers would do if you put too much um organic inorganic chemicals into into your production system that ends up sipping through to the rivers and the underground water which then reduces the Vitality of that water to actually give us life but the issue of water is more complex than most people would want to believe because in terms of the law for me to be able to irrigate and use river water for my um farming activities I need a water license and we know that most of these rivers are fully subscribed in terms of the water licenses that they have been issued so in terms of what water and sanitation on the on on on paper at is that most of these Rivers cannot give any more licenses to people to irrigate all right quite an interesting conversation thank you so much for your time Dr appreciate it that was Dr tasab there who's a researcher

HalPgCCdeR4,Dr Levy Ndou on Mkhwebane's resignation from EFF,2024-10-16T17:32:14Z,26733,former public protector and economic freedom fighter Member of Parliament buum Quan has resigned from her party and Parliament in her resignation letter addressed to EF president Julius malma M explains how she felt her rights were violated when she served as the public protector of the country she further laments her removal as public protector because of the cases she investigated which include the cr17 donations and the Pala Pala report she adds that she'll be focusing on spending time with her family the eff exactly a year ago on this day and served on the Justice portfolio Committee in Parliament all right joining us for more on Advocate bu Quan's resignation is political analyst Dr Lindo good afternoon doctor thank you very much for joining us on the program your reaction firstly to Advocate M's resignation from the eff good afternoon fundo good afternoon to the viewers at home um I think it's important to note that um people would join political parties out of their Free Will and they will also leave political parties out of their free will uh this has been the case with with it is not something new for someone to resign from a political party but I think it's important to note that at the time when she was facing serious challenges the efff was there for her the eff embraced her and also gave her a huge responsibility to become a public representative even though there are some who would say she could have done very little for the efff as a political party but I think the leadership of the efff took a bold step to say you have a home in the eff we can still be able to accommodate you maybe you can still be able to resuscitate your life and make a difference in the politics of the eff and those of South Africa that seems to have been the tone somewhat of that letter a tone of gratitude for just the eff embracing her after all that had happened but somehow some have brought back her August tweet where she said she would never leave the eff or more accur accurately she would never betray the eff they've tried to almost link today's resignation with that tweet of never betraying the efff suggesting that in this moment she has betrayed the efff is it fair though to try and view her resignation as some sort of a betrayal because one we all know that she wrote that tweet in response to reports at the time that she was possibly joining the MK party along with Floyd shibambu we need to look at these issues holistically um there are many political leaders who have vowed not to leave certain political parties but they eventually left such political parties joins uh Julius malma who vowed not to leave thec but in his case he was expelled he and there are many other politicians who have vowed not to leave their political homes but they ended up leaving you will always get different um views or responses to these kind of resignations some in the efff could feel that she has betrayed them because she just the party and then she was elevated to become a public representative and they could feel that dumping them at this stage not because they did not perform very very well is something that they could not accept but at the pardon me for interjecting mhm pardon me for interjecting their doctor but I suppose we cannot forget the fact that this specific resignation comes hot on the heels of that Court loss on the 10 million gratui so wouldn't some say perhaps she's exhausted at this point she says something quite emotional um she says that um this cases and the life that she has been going through has been quite very difficult for her and has actually taken a very serious St St strain on her life and that is why she feel that she need to bow out and spend a lot of or good time with a family but equally one would also take it from another angle and say maybe she felt that when she's going into the eff the E might fight her battles and make sure that whatever she wanted she aspired to get she might end up getting such and unfortunately the eff had its own political program and um she might have felt that they've not done enough but I think it's also important to note outside politics that when an individual says I've had enough and I think I need time to rest such people should be um given such space because that should be coming straight from my heart unless something else changes MH but in that same letter she didn't spare others she maintained that she was unconstitutionally removed no one has been spared in the with the likes of the media being attacked mainstream media she feels the Judiciary failed her even the executive and Parliament what did you make of just that assertion I think uh it is just an expression that seek to suggest that um she feels that she has been a victim of all the events that were happening surrounding her she could still be saying that everything that she did was correct and all other people who think otherwise could be wrong wrong and unfortunately because you have got so many institutions in South Africa that she went to in order to to get their own opinions and unfortunately she has not been able to get any institution that supported her and that is an unfortunate part that has actually gone through but my view also stands that when you have an individual who comes out openly and say I've had enough and this environment appears to be very toxic and life is too hard for me I need to take a rest that is one step bold that she has taken and I think that it has to be respected MH and then just before I let you go doctor I just want to get your views on today's Court developments we had two ANC senior members appearing in court today made his first appearance for corruption charges but we also had NOA appearing of course today for the pre-trial hearing just that picture what does it say honestly because there are those who say that is a picture that says to South Africa that no one is above the law you can have members of the governing party being put before the process While others are saying it's a sad day and it's a shame that you find senior members of the African National Congress sitting on court benches is the second spokesperson or former spokes person of the E of thec who is appearing in court there is still a court case that is running that involves um ziz codra we also know about the court cases against um KY house was also once the spokesperson of thec that says a lot about thec as a political party because these are the individuals who were seen as the heroes of thec yeah who Artic position to an extent where the membership of thec had to give them responsibilities in the party and my view is that thec still has to go into a session of thak cleansing and have a lot of explanation to make because when you've got a prominent member of the political party appearing in court in it says a lot about that political party and those that are in the party always have something to explain regarding the appearance of their members doctor thank you very much for your time this afternoon that's political analyst Dr Levin do

jogsZymDhH8,Westbury Protest | Protest over service delivery and water shortages,2024-10-16T17:22:54Z,2369,all right let's go to this now on deas road has been baded by angry coronationville and Westbury residents the community is calling for action after their Taps ran dry for some days now it's understand it's understood in fact that a nearby old age facility has also been affected let's bring you some live visuals um from the scene and see what's currently taking place there this is what it looks like right now our reporter offens steo has been tracking the story for us we'll keep these visuals a little bit um longer on air and talk about what we are seeing offens of course you spent pretty much the day tracking water wolves from H SC now to this let's talk about these particular residents what are they crying about because it does seem like water comes at certain times yes absolutely thank you very much bongi well I can tell you that you know the residents of Westberry and coronationville they say that for the past four years they've had ertic water supply whereby water would actually come back around 1 in the morning for like an hour and then some would actually put in uh washing to sort of try and wash as quick as they possibly cans of the morning in the early hours of the morning so the fact that they woke up so early this morning to be in the streets you know braving the cold front actually showed the sheer desperation that that they actually have you know because over those years they actually have not had water they say they've appealed to councel they've spoken to JC water but for some reason you know they are given promises and those promises unfortunately do not come to fruition as you rightfully mentioned on deas is still located what had happened is that early in the morning they were there and then they decided that because now the traffic has subsided they just going to go and rest and wait for pick our traffic to come again and so that their impact can be felt and maybe their grievances can also be addressed and as you say that they've been trying to engage the city for quite some time now and really if this is what they are resorting to it does seem like it's something they're planning to do until their grievances are heard yes from what the mentioned they said that this is what they will actually be doing each and every single day until someone from the council actually comes they says they say that the local counselor who's actually not actually residing there is out of touch with uh some of uh you know the challenges that residents are actually facing you know that Westbury also has a challenge of gangsterism as well and they feel that they're on their own most of the time and backing up maybe a wrong tree because most of the time when they voice their discontent nothing is actually done and in fact it was a hunch for us to actually pick up this story because we were driving to Petoria and we picked up this traffic you know and we thought man let's ask what's happening and someone said that no it's actually West bu residents they are fed up with the fact that they haven't had water for such a long time then when we went there that's when we actually picked up the fact that you know there's this thing that's happening where the for years the water supply has actually been erratic and this comes on the backdrop where Rand water had actually announced that there's a day Zero looming because apparently they had engaged with municipalities here in hting to sort of curb water usage I believe below 33% but they're saying unfortunately that wasn't done and unfortunately we find ourselves in a situation where water levels are actually critically low here in the province of and even speaking to the deputy minister of water and sanitation David Mato he does confirm um that in fact in hting while systems may be healthy but um there is of course a potential crisis that is looming there and he was talking about the meeting with the premier and I mean you can see these are you know rocks that are locating those roads motor are struggling but at the same time this is not the only Community um offenser that you've had to have a conversation with there is the hkr community as well inani um that at some point we remember over the years they were complaining about contaminated water now it seems like they don't have water currently yes there's actually a complete shutdown of water because apparently they say there was an incident that happened on the second of October where electricity Supply to Ray valal was affected by a fire that happened at a Power Station then immediately after that Roy Val was not able to actually purify the water so by the time the water reaches Lal Dam which is the last point before it actually gone to the tber water treatment plant before it can go to the Taps it actually had stools in it you know it had uh it was basically contaminated let me put it that way yeah and of course this is a community that would be uh you know worried given what they would have seen with water situations in the past what is the city doing about this well the city is saying that they're actually working around the clock to actually examine the water that's inside the Lal Dam because they're saying that you know they've managed to fix the problem that was affecting rayal so now rayal is able to purify the water and once it reaches L Dam it's supposed to be in a condition where the tber water Tre treatment plant is able to make it viable for consumption you know so they're saying that by end of this week they're actually going to get the test results and will inform their way forward all right I was going to ask as to when do they believe that the situation can be resolved and as you and I are chatting I saw some videos um you know some some visuals through the corner of my eye it seems like police um are trying to engage with the community of Westbury there um as they're then trying to possibly get them to maybe move um from the area because as you say it is peak hour traffic um it is going to be causing quite a bit of a nightmare and I suppose the Joba Council now will have some serious questions to answer as well as even the mayor and the MMC TSS with this responsibility as to why a community will complain so much and still not be from me absolutely and what they also mentioned that I found a bit awkward they're saying areas around Westbury and coronation actually have water they were mentioning sville which is an informal settlement and they're saying that most of the time when they don't have water the informal settlement would have water and they feel hard done by cuz they're saying that they're paying their rates they're paying their tax ta but for some reason they are on the back foot when it comes to the provision of services all right um I know Herbert m is on his own there as he's bringing us this visuals I wonder if we're able to listen in to hear what the police are saying at all reality about understand live visuals there of Westy residents as you hear myself and offens um having a conversation about this very protest by these residents who are saying that they do have intermittent water supply I mean you think about people who have to do their laundry at 1:00 in the morning when they do have a bit of a supply of water which last for about an hour and police are now trying to get them to clear the roads and I suppose offens it always raises questions when we see police then coming of course it is their jobs to try and reopen the roads but at the same time they they shouldn't be the ones to quill this protest because ultimately people are looking to the city to provide the answers absolutely and bangi where you can imagine there they didn't invite the media there was no statement that wanted to gain media attention of their protest and they just basically were there to get what they wanted the protest itself was not protected and the police were there so they were willing to sort of compromise everything even their freedom to be arrested for you know contravening the traff and everything just so that their voices can be heard and they can actually get water all right offens thank you so much for that update and in fact we will be tracking the story and do ask the city of joelberg for their reaction to this particular story and the claims that are being made by this community and the fact that right now the community is back again on the streets and they are still demanding water there that's my colleague offens steo who's been tracking the story for us for

rllAhEUVayo,Legal analyst Melusi Xulu on Pule Mabe stepping aside and Mapisa-Nqakula's case,2024-10-16T16:37:23Z,3254,"a m has stepped aside from his position as ANC NEC member while awaiting his court case this follows the release of him and six co- accused on 30,000 rent bail the case against a former National Assembly speaker meanwhile has been postponed until December 5 2024 the defense has informed the court that they have not been granted access to certain sections of the docket which is hindering their ability to proceed with the trial let's bring in our legal analyst aulu he joins us now to unpack the developments in the fraud and Corruption cases of the former ANC spokesperson M and of course the former National Assembly speaker NOA thank you so much for your time mru let's start perhaps with the former National Assembly speaker's case then you know perhaps expand on the reasons behind uh the postponement you know we earlier heard that it was due to an application she then needs to file for disclosure of certain parts of that part B and C I think it was to you and to the viewers at home thank you for having me when basically this is what happens when you have a case um you get a contents of the docket or copies so what you usually get you get part A Part A usually contains um what the w Witnesses are saying about your case or the expert Witnesses or documentary evidence and so forth so that's usually generally what you get but when it comes to Part B it's basically internal aspects of the case which are amongst maybe the detectives and the prosecutors and part is the investigation diary so usually when we are defending we usually don't ask for that because sometimes part A is enough but if you want more and you want need more clarity you have a right to ask for that there has been case laws that has allowed that if the med is taken to court to get access to that so the reason for postponing is that H the former speaker just wants everything on her table so that she can be able to defend herself that's why the M was postponed it was of course her you know her first time appearing then in the high court and um as they you know lead towards the the main trial it does seem that the judge was quite annoyed you know by certain applications not being made prior are these then related to this particular application yes you know you before the matter is postponed to a different Court in this case in particular to high court you usually get all your documents in in in in District Courts if it's still in District Court which is a lower courtt and if you have any representations to make you make those representations at that Court I'll give you a current case which is a clear example in the case of um I think there is a case that was postponed for representation in in the same court in palmridge so you make those issues in the district court and then you're able to postpone the matter in high court when all issues have been resolved uh let's now uh move out on to the MBE and the six other accused case I mean they've now been granted bail he's since stepped aside ASC NEC in accordance with the anc's policy uh just looking at what transpired this afternoon I mean to what extent did the state not opposing bail in this case and the fact that the accused handed themselves over to the Hawks before this court appearance to what extent does this then play in the Court's decision to Grant and bail okay I think uh if if I must Express this um well I I would like to express it anyways I believe that when it's high-profile individuals or high profile cases inverted commers usually the bail application is usually not uh postponed for seven days and so forth as per procedure not that it must be postponed for seven days but you usually feel that they are treated with soft gloves or or you know with the with some favors but anyways I think that's how B should be done where it's proven that you're not a flight risk your address has been verified you'll not interfere with State Witnesses and um you know it shows that you are not a person who will interfere with the bail system or do anything that is wrong especially if you don't have previous cases that have been convicted or you've been convicted of so I think the reason why they were given B basically that they not flat risk but I'm just saying you know on just just as a note that sometimes when it's just usual people who are not high profile the mess is usually postponed for two weeks or so or for seven days but when you say it's a high profile person you just come in the morning and you get ba so I usually see that you know all animals are equal but they're not equal as it's it is you know but basically in Bay if you're not a flat risk you usually get B and that's what happen today all right uh just uh let's unpack then you know the the seriousness of this particular case uh when looking at the charges that are related and in connection with this 27 million R tender to uh his company inviro Mobi I mean this tender was meant to benefit and Empower waste Pickers in the eani Metro primarily how would the state then go about this particular matter just given that earlier on we heard how the prosecutor was arguing that bu did in fact not declare his links to this company when he was MP and he should have uh as it relates to the code of ethics rules I think it's um it's something that I'm not saying all politicians are doing but it's something that the politicians who are in high positions are usually doing where they they would you know have companies that are created that are linked to them but they will not disclose and then they'll be able to get you know some way of influencing how the tender should go so uh it's what most politicians are doing it's obviously corrupt and it's wrong but at the end of the day you know I as a defense attorney usually I'll say maybe let us look at the whole case when it's done in trial because today was not a day for a trial uh it was a day for a bail application so it was not that important what what the state is saying for now but what was important was do they Des to get bail but for the purposes of a trial obviously the the matter will then have to be dealt with a trial and it it will have to be proven Beyond Reasonable Doubt whether there was some correct activities from a criminal perspective is this one of those cases that will perhaps take months if not years yes it possibly will it depends on the number of charges depends on the number of witnesses and it depends on the technicalities that the state has to have in order to prove their case so if that is a lot of evidence that the state has to prove it will take it might take years but we've seen in these cases H umti where first before the Met is tries they usually want to make representations and I suspect that before the Met is postponed to a high court if it will be done in high court there might be representation that might be made but let's see what the defense will do in terms of their strategy all right thank you so much for your time is a legal expert there for us just giving analysis on those two prominent cases that we are following for you in court in fact at the back of the outcome of that bail condition that was granted in the B MBE case he has since stepped aside ASC NEC member as it is our breaking news story of the hour for"

_aPNR7Vhx6Y,Lusikisiki mass murders | Prof Kholofelo Rakubu weighs in on arrests made,2024-10-16T15:45:09Z,2451,all right let's now rope in criminologist Professor Kell rubu to weigh in on the developments in the AR rest of the suspects in luiki Prof thank you so much for your time this afternoon let's first get your reaction uh you know just on the swiftness in which the three suspects have been arrested shortly after the police of course released that wanted list alert yesterday I mean what does this then speak to good afternoon um this just clearly highlights the role of communities in crime prevention crime detection or Crime Control um the the community and South Africa as a whole came together H to ensure the Swift apprehension of the suspect but again from this and the caliber of the suspects it Taps now take or it takes us to issues around our parel system or issues around our offender centered legislative or criminal justice system because one of them has been through the system if not all of them and some one of them might have been recruited by another victim another suspect who has been through our justice system so much resources have been compered around rehabilitating particular offender who has today robbed the country this much so it it now forces us to revisit long-standing issues with who qualifies for parole and how as a country we respond to Crime because look at what has happened this could have been avoided if now policies or responses were on par with crime commissions individuals and Prof we'll come back we'll come back to those loopholes in the justice system uh I want to ask then you know when you look at and pay a close attention to this murder and how it was orchestrated it was brutal with no human sped I mean some family members were all killed How likely are the suspects who have now been nabbed police have also arrested four of course uh How likely are they to solve this case for police I mean officers are optimistic that they'll be able to piece the information together very likely um we we do have resources we do have capabilities um what mostly will be lacking is when there's no intelligence um that is supported by thorough structures you understand so in this case thorough intelligence was utilized maybe due to public pressure and so forth and again we are here because of community support and Community reactions but then it is very likely to because there's willingness to solve this matter there's willingness to apprehend there was so much outcry um although we are reactive this kind could have been um prevented should we have had um intelligence in place to pick or to to project this kind of mass shooting because now they are happening everywhere no provent is spared from this so it shows that like they are saying they've utilized intelligence lead policing or operation that is what is required so with them apprehend like this we are likely um this should assist in also tapping into other plans around this but again we are just thrown into the deep ends to reflect as a country that definitely we are not responding to crime and we are not understanding crime for what it is and we don't even take into consideration the kind of of an offender we have Prof I want to go back to your earlier state stat ments that you made in as far as communities are concerned it would seem that the community speaking out has made these arrest possible at the risk of course of whistleblowers we do understand that one person actually came out to say these people have actually rented a space within her neighborhood but legislation around whistleblowers has been criticized you know just given the risk to life and livelihood for those that come forward how should law enforcement authorities deal better with with whistleblowers which is probably why we did not see a lot of community members in other shooting incidents come forward you wouldn't want to come forward because you understand of the risk and the loopholes in this and the lack of protection in particular uh there has been challenges around whistleblower protection because we are mostly offender centered once you blow and we will not even sure of your protection because of the issues with the justice system where some of the officers that are supposed to protect you are on the offenders payroll so you wouldn't want to risk so since we do have such issues within our Justice cluster it is difficult to even promise communities of protections because there's so much evidence that we've failed in many instances to protect them once whistleblower um protection is upgraded or thoroughly explained or discussed or even amended um with evidence as to to what extent as a victim will I be protected because now they are even um sharing where the location and a Community member coming forward to um notify or tip off the officers of these people's where about now some innocent individual one innocent individual is going to be a Target because she or he saw us coming in or since this is a rented um accommodation the landlord's life might be in danger or even relatives or even communities around because now you sold us out they might send their friends to come in some information when it comes to identification or where offenders have been apprehended or how whistleblowing process took out to took place that should be protected because there are many lives um involved here and again we understand now how heartless this um suspects are so anything can happen and if they are four it is likely that they are 10 in number or even 15 so what's going to happen to the community or even the landlord who who who who owns the accommodation where they were renting so you you realize that the minute you highlight they were TP there was a tip off from a Community member that is something else Prof found them and that is enough yeah Prof I want to take a step back and and I mean when the 18 community members were buried following this heinous crime uh it was uh a shocking for not only people in South Africa but abroad I want to just go back to you know some of the factors that are driving the increase in mass shootings in South Africa particularly in rural areas which also highlights how easily Firearms land in the wrong hands perhaps you can give us your observations here okay we we have issues with ma mass shooting because like you said availability of firearms accessibility issues with what a prolification of guns in South Africa right and again we have issues with mass shooting because of corruption within the system some of these guns are from law enforcers some have been sold and so forth some were stolen so we this we are suffering replication of the gun loss there has been calls for quite some time that the um gun act right should be reviewed at some point there were talks around it's being finalized and their research around how the a gun access in South Africa should tighten up but we have issues with easy access like through our poorest borders we have issues in our borders again why are communities especially rural communities vulnerable let's step into issues of crime prevention environmental design by virtue of our community's design right they are vulnerable to certain um victimization particularly mass shooting because they are issues of Access Control territoriality surveillance and so forth so it is easy to evade in rural communities they got in and they killed 18 people and it was not easy to even tell which car they drove in and out or what were they wearing because in in such communities um access they are easily accessible besid being easily accessible they are very far from um critical structures police stations and so forth right so issues of surveillance and again rural communities are not they don't easily tell of such they don't easily participate due to fear they don't easily um reflect on their surroundings and um strangers in communities or issues of territoriality where a gate will be thoroughly managed like if I'm sure there was not even difficult to access the houses yeah Prof we're going to wrap up soon but uh last question um I want to squeeze this one in and if you can be brief please Prof as you answer we've seen how this incident has caught the attention of the president the National Police Commissioner as well as the police Minister and of course the Swift arrest uh by South Africa standards of course in this particular matter I mean when we start talking about the Justice cluster and the loopholes within that system can we not solve all murder cases especially heinous ones such as this one in this fashion what is the problem the problem the police cannot work alone somebody somewhere knows who are the perpetrators right so the minute we don't give them information they will not win again on their side thorough extensive intelligence is required so if they are not doing their part communities are also losing trust in the police so they will not even come forward to assist but the police should be what crime intelligence should be at least steps ahead to analyze to utilize environmental analysis Community Dynamics to for project what might come up so it is not easy they should do their work so that communities also can start to believe in the police or our justice system to come forward and Report some knew before this could happen but because of the distrust and the Gap and the frustration or poor police Community relation this happened and now police had to be reactive they were found wanting because of what multiple issues in their responses to cry all right prop thank you so much for your time really do appreciate your analysis

than half in fact of the country's households is facing food insecurities the number is 6 3% and I think the minister of Agriculture John stean Hazen is here today to celebrate or observe world food day and I think she he would be the fitting person to speak too about this issue Minister 63% of South African households are facing food insecurities that is a grim picture it certainly is a grim picture and I think it now is a Clarion call and a call to action now for a whole of society approach to dealing with food insecurity and hunger across the country the real is government cannot do it alone and that's why we also relying on Partnerships Partnerships within government across government departments but also Partnerships with the private sector partnership with corporate South Africa Partnerships with NOS cbos schools to get on top of the situation the report that I released last week now gives us an understanding about where the real problems lie and what that does allows us to direct resources and budget towards addressing these particular problems at source you as you rightly said the report uh paints a grim picture most particularly for the northern cape and that's why we've chosen uh uh the northern Cape to celebrate world food day and to talk about food security and look at homegrown initiatives to be able to to assist in making sure that more people have access to healthy nutritious food on a regular basis but minister some might say this is reactive we've always known that people need to eat it's nothing it's not a new phenomenon that South Africans are going to bed hungry isn't this a reactive measure now shouldn't this have been done long before we even get such a survey well I think that the the problem in the past has been without Baseline data it's been very difficult to Target the issue not all of South Africa is food insecure uh and the incidents of food insecurity are isolated to particular districts that we're now able to drill down on we've made a very clear commitment as the government of national Unity that decision making and budgeting will be done on evidence-based decision making what we now have with the report is a baseline report it now gives us something to measure ourselves against as we tackle but also instead of a shotgun approach to trying to deal with the problem we're able to now sharp focus it in those areas identified in the report and obviously everybody can play a role in this yeah and maybe let's talk about recent flood and do you think these are also affecting in some way when we look at the environment and what is happening we've had even snow at some point things that were were not there do you think there's an effect of some sort yes of course and I mean anybody who denies that climate change is real only needs to look at the agre sector we've been hit this year by terrible droughts but also severe flooding we've been hit with devastating fires but also thick and heavy snow and all this has an impact on food security whether it's the black Frost and Limpopo that killed the large potato crop whether it's a livestock that had been lost in the Eastern Cape and in quaza Nutella and now the Northwest through drought and fire all of this has an impact on food security and obviously every crop lost to any one of these natural disasters uh is is food that's not going onto a plate somewhere so we have to find ways to mitigate and become more resilient and that involves a whole wide range of things from new breeding Technologies for uh more resilient crops and Grains to making sure that we are burning fire brakes and making sure that we're prepared for these disasters when they happen and I just think lastly uh Minister we cannot isolate this issue it has to be economic as well the cost of living has been high for many South Africans are not affording things they could afford three years ago for argument sake will you be working with other departments to to ensure that you'll curb this food insecurity that we are seeing in the country there's a number of things that have to be looked at because it is a cross departmental approach things that affect the food price or are things like the fuel price things like import tariffs things like V things like the rising uh cost of being able to transport food around the country and of course load shedding uh had had had a devastating impact on that so it is working together across government departments the government of national Unity is committed to Bringing Down the cost of food and we're already in the medium-term development plan looking at a number of ways which we can achieve it the president has tossed us to say we've got to make food more affordable in South Africa

FpL9jItzjaw,Former President Thabo Mbeki speaks about Tito Mboweni,2024-10-16T14:51:51Z,16242,well for more on The Life and Times of dto B we cross now to sabc international news editor Sophie mwena who is in conversation with former South African president taboi good afternoon to you Sophie uh over to you yes unti we are here at the Tumi Foundation where we are going to be in conversation with the former South African president tabi who was also the for president of thec as you heard from Professor Mah stayed in loto and from loto I was told by Professor Mah and also Professor Santo that he left for the United Kingdom and this is where he told Professor suai later that he met the former president Mr President Professor s Santo says when when he met you in London he called him and said yo finally I met this man tab tell us that your first meeting with ding outside the country it's possible it's possible it's possible that uh he we met in England but the went to England to University of East Anga long after I had left England I was inaka already but I might have been visiting I might have been visiting England but so you know I I would remember more meeting him in laka rather than in England but certainly that was before we came home let's talk about luaka your meeting with him in laka and working with him well you know Tito as you know studied economics at and the investor of theu as well as e Anglia so by the time he got to laka he was an economist and so he belonged to that group inaga which would include maxu and others who were dealing with this what do we do with the South African economy post liberation uh so I would have met him in that context as one of the subcommittees of the of the NC then which would be working on that kind of detail um he Contin in that sort of work even when we came home he was quite young at that time he was very young yes he was very young indeed even when he passed away he was still young H he was was young and uh it was very good to have young people like that qualified uh with specialized in whatever whatever subjects in this case it was economics very much very much involved in the movement very much committed to the task of Liberation uh and very much committed to the use of his qualifications of these expertise to advance the process of Liberation so it was it was very inspir those those young people with us with us you and then he became a cabinet minister what could have prompted Madiba to have appointed him the minister of Labor because when you look at Madiba he was in Robin Island he often say that uh for him it was going to be difficult to appoint a cabinet because he didn't know many of the young people because he was not there and he actually relied on you for advice What could have prompted MBA well inde MBA MBA asked me after the elections at the end of the elections to to make a proposal just to him whom he might appoint from thec who whom he might appoint to what positions as ministers Deputy ministers and so we had to then discuss so had to make recommendations to him and explain why and Tito we propose that Tito should be minister of Labor because of the the important task that Liberation must bring about very serious changes in terms of the Labor Relations situation in the country because as you know historically the Trade union movement starting with Saku South African Congress of trade unions became part of the Congress movement because they were saying in order to achieve the objectives that a normal Trade union movement wants collective bargaining right to strike and all that that could only come about in a changed political situation and therefore they as trade unions also had a responsibility to contribute to the struggle for political liberation which was which is why Kat also became part of the UDF same argument that as unions as is trade unions it's our responsibility to help bring about the political change to create the possibility for the development of the proper labor relation situation so we thought that it was an important area focused by this major Ally this major Ally of the of thec the TR union movement this particular particular area of the Labor Relations that you needed somebody like an economist they understood Labor Relations labor economics but also understood very very well the the challenge of the democratic Revolution to help the trade un movement to produce the conditions for which they had been struggling over over many decades so we thought that ditto would be best placed um to lead that kind of process and indeed when we made that recommendation to m m accepted that and then in 1999 you come in you appoint him the governor of The Reserve Bank a very important institution that was not transformed at that time you look at the pictures white male with ties and very few uh black including women what prompted you to say didto now move to the res Bank well it had been agreed actually Sophia before 99 we had agreed that we needed to replace christas christas you remember was the governor of The Reserve Bank we inherited him from the aparted system and kept him uh and thought that but but by by 1998 we thought that no it is necessary to change even Chris himself to be to be hon honest was himself saying it was time for change so Tito Tito was appointed Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank in 1998 and because the law required that the person who's appointed as governor of The Reserve Bank must have banking experience so for the one year thatto served as Deputy to Chris St he was accumulating that banking experience so that's why was in appointed in 1990 1999 as as governor of The Reserve Bank having had that one year experience as Deputy to to christans because it was it was clear that you know with all the changes remember the we started off with Yan F in the police and then at some point we said let's change we started with with General meing in the military and at a certain point we said no not time to change liur the finance then time to change fire at the Reserve Bank and there monetary policy by by 1998 we thought it was time to change I I must also say chrisal himself thought it was time time to change the monetary policy later on became a problem a headache for him because he was being criticized how he went about about in terms of the the the Mandate of this Central Bank what is it that perhaps people couldn't understand in terms of him executing his responsibility as the governor what was his mandate in terms of The Reserve Bank how it h execute its mandate post 1994 well he was CR criticized by some people uh the in in terms of the decisions that were taken uh The the Reserve Bank had to liaz with the treasury in terms of Economic Policy so that there would always be constant relationship between the fiscal policy from Treasury and monetary policy from the Governor from The Reserve Bank and so that's always that's that happened that kind of IND direction and you needed it's part of the reason it was necessary to move away from a person who inherited from the old order because you then ensured that you had person as head of the Reserve Bank who would elas with the person who's head of the treasury but they're coming from the same political school so the political leadership would be from the same home it was important to do that and uh know the uh and it's a government it's a government that is decided on this inflation targeting and then said to the government to The Reserve Bank therefore you must the inflation must be kept within whatever the bounds were um so there were there were some some people it that debate continues to this day that uh the we followed in a monetary policy which was too restrictive do you agree with that no I I think the money mon policy that the government while I was in government the monetary policy that we we we maintained was correct it related to a broad policy about the macroeconomic stability of the country uh you know we for instance it's part of the reason in terms of the implementation of those policies as part of the reason that we ended up having budget surpluses which meant we were not paying money lenders to to service a debt we're generating enough money to invest in Social benefits in the economy and so on so the management of the micro economy had produced those positive results that would include monetary policy monetary policy was very much part of that so I think do we as I was saying I think earlier to somebody else that even when the global e economy crisis came in 2008 starting with the crisis in the in the banks in the US which affected us here we actually had the on the government side we had resources because of the budget surpluses to respond to that kind of Crisis so uh no I think that basically the macroeconomic policy was managed in a way that you could you could get the rat of development in the economy of country 5% and in all of that um it was from government the government had no problem you spoke about him being involved in helping to steer the ship uh and having the suppas that assisted assisted the country during difficult times he was also part of the team that would go to G20 including the Finance Minister and uh we are told that they had to come up with a solution in terms of the Asian uh Market challenges you were the president at that time the role at the G20 and now South Africa will be hosting G20 no the issue that we raised with the G the major issue that we raised with GT G20 at the time the G20 was made up of the finance ministers so Trevor was a member of the G20 the issue that we were raising particularly around the crisis that started in 2008 was that this gave us an opportunity as South Africa it gives us an opportunity to intervene with the with the G8 with the G20 to say to them you see you've got this financial crisis which comes from the way the banks have misbehaved in the states and therefore the the notion that the capitalist system is is so well functioning and that it will always produce good things is wrong this is not been demonstrated and therefore we need to look at the functioning of the economic system so that you guarantee against crisis of this kind which result in unemployment and and all of that so we needed to make an intervention an intervention that would address this a very serious structural issue uh the nature of the economy the nature of the functioning of the global economy which was essentially capitalist that we needed to reform it in such a way that it didn't produce his negative results but you know what happened of course we would agreed with that with with Trevor Manuel Min of Finance but of course the the G20 was immediately complely transformed into heads of state thing yes it became heads of state thing no longer for the ministers and I think the first Major meeting in that context of the G20 was in the UK under Gordon Brown as prime minister I think by that time the capacity the possibility we had to make the kind of intervention that Trevor would have made to say Let us look at the functioning of the system ER the crisis had the situation had changed by then what what was then decided by the G20 when it met in England with Gordon Brown as the host was addressing other issues let's talk about mren now back in the country as a finance minister you were not in government president Raposa brought him back do you think that was a wise move by President Raposa to bring him back after retirement no yes I think I I think so I think the the president was wise to look at somebody like Tito with the experience that didto had to handle a difficult Financial economic situation in the country um Tito Tito was very reluctant he called me to tell me that he's been approached by the president wants president wants him to do this but he was really very very reluctant because he thought his own viewers why why bring back all these old people he had left government long before why don't you find other younger people I I think it was also think of himself as when that he when he became a minister when he was young why don't find other young people of that kind of age to bring in today but I I said to him that no my view was that the president was correct and really he needed to respond positively to the request by the president which he did I think was it was a correct decision but all the time he was there he was uncomfortable why uncomfortable besides the issue of age no because he one of the one of the challenges he said you see having been minister of Labor uh my recollection of government is working with that team of people working in that kind of cabinet now I'm being asked to join a new cabinet people I don't know I've never worked with even the capacity to work together in a collective way with all of these people was very uncertain about that he would he he recalled what had been the case before and it could not be reproduced so it was better to get new people a new person to deal with his ones rather than him in a s you were getting a a peg to fit into a hole and and he he was was quite uncomfortable about me he then assisted Paul kagame with the reforms of the Au and now he was chairing the the that important peace uh Fund in fact I expected him to be at your conference but I didn't see him in terms of that work and you often criticize the Au where it is now do you think they were able to help to try and strengthen the Au it was it was correct to take the decision that there should be established a peace fund so that the African Union in terms of its peacekeeping operations it should Finance them itself because um generally the situation has been up to today that in terms of peacekeeping operations of the African Union we depend on donors to finance those operations so it was correct for the a to say let's set up a peacekeeping fund I'm very very glad that they had tto there to to play that role of helping to build that fund it's because of the confidence they had in him and I think they seen many of them as part of in international banking situation that kind of confidence in him um so it was was a good thing of course you are quite correct president Paul kagame was also asked by the African Union to look at the restructuring of the Union to make it more effect effective more efficient and all that and he also got Tito to become part of the committee to deal with that U they they did their work reported and it was approved by heads of state but I I think there was certain fundamental mistakes in what they proposed for instance the uh in for in terms of cost reduction they decided that the commission for political Affairs should be merged with the commission for peace and security so the commissioner today is the of the Au is the commissioner of for political Affairs peace and security

8zBsScJV0kg,Mkhwebane leaves EFF | 'Some people were using EFF as a halfway station': Sandile Swana,2024-10-16T13:42:05Z,32471,former public protector and economic freedom fighter Member of Parliament mus quani has resigned from her party and from Parliament well in her resignation letter addressed to e president Julius malma M kabani explains how she felt her rights were violated when she served as a public protector of the country she further laments her removal as public protector because of the cases she investigated which included the cr17 donation as well as the Pala Pala report she adds that she'll be focusing on spending time with her family M joined the eff exactly a year ago in on this day and served on the Justice portfolio Committee in Parliament well political analyst s lewana joins us now via video link uh to weigh in on the resignation of uh Advocate musan from the economic freedom fighters thank you so much for for your time Mr swan I mean it wasn't too long ago that uh you know Advocate M denied claims that she was in fact resigning from the EF or thinking of leaving I mean does this then come as a surprise that she has now resigned from the party as well as Parliament uh thank you so much unti and your viewers ER well from my perspective even if that perspective may have been mistaken at the time when there were indications that there are certain people who would leave the E uh I counted among those that would leave the EF but she didn't leave immediately uh but obviously uh prior I supect prior to this announcement H she did a show with c and b where she both where she announced that she she's she's going to resign in as far as I know so uh yeah so in terms of her political character if there is such a thing then uh it's not totally surprising and in fact she does say on that podcast you know that um you know politics uh is not her thing but there's of course a lot of speculation in terms of where she might be going do you think that she will still find herself in politics well I tried to listen to her from that perspective and also just to go back to her her work experience and things like that and and why for instance she she thinks that politics is is is a problem when you don't have the majority in Parliament uh maybe she could go to politics if she believes for instance through MK they might have the majority uh but that work that as she defines it of Defending human rights and other things there is no place where the people who defend human rights are the majority or have the majority in any case so she might be an academic she might be in the NGO space but I don't think she's going to disappear how much then of her decision could be as a result of perhaps you know limitations within the eff uh itself you know that leave very little room for her uh to maneuver into the leadership uh structures and also Advance her Ambitions I mean she does talk of course about you know people that have been longstanding within the leadership structures of the eff she did also indicate that there is um you know very little uh growth perspective uh you know for her as she alluded of course in that podcast how much of that also talks to just how the eff is structured well there could be issues like that but uh you know I could be accused of being mischievous but you know in cases like this Helen when people were living her organization others blamed racism others black leaders and this and the other thing but as we speak today uh the it looks like Lord shedding is coming my way H uh like uh there is a sense in which these leaders live uh precisely because ideologically they are incompatible with the political party uh but leaders live I mean the DA has produced so many other political parties and for many different reasons ANC has produced its own others have left the eff and so on actions they left and so on and so forth so I I think that efff is going through a period where it has to clarify even more than before where it stands politically and just on that last point I mean where do we place all of these resignations within the EFA and also when we have to look at of course the MK party she did indicate that she had been approached by various political parties but in fact several times by the MK party where does this leave the two political parties if we're comparing the eff and the MK the there is a statement in the letter written byan that it was a place of Refuge after she has been you know almost sped out by Parliament and and the ruling elit H it was a place where she could go and and when the lik man and others were living MK my view I mean living the eff my view was that some of these people uh used the eff as a halfway station the eff had been warehousing ANC members of The Zuma faction for quite some time whether the EF was cognizant of that fact is another matter but what the eff should know by now is that that they cannot house ANC people there the

CRxNmA1hTTo,World Food Day | Grassroots interventions to tackle food insecurity: Johan Kotzé,2024-10-16T13:27:56Z,349,"as many as 309 million people in fact the 2024 summer cropping season in the Eastern Cape is currently underway and more than 22,000 hectares of grain are expected to be planted by more than 10,000 communal and emerging Farmers while the department of rural development and agrarian reform is putting 80 million Rand into the project this year the aim is to create food security uh let's in fact also delve into this other top story that we are um tracking for you this afternoon and of course that is related to food insecurity across the globe as many as 309 million people are facing acute levels of food uh security insecurity rather across the globe in fact we do have with us Agri SAA CEO Yan auta who joins us now just to weigh in on this particular story Mr K thank you so much for your time this afternoon uh just in terms of what we are faced with now there is of course the world food program's uh uh 2024 data that has been released with some rather shocking you know uh uh picture of of of what we are looking at when you look at the insecurity levels another report a local one this time of the South African food security index of 2024 which is developed by two uh Economist from the University of Selen BOS indicates that food Security in this country is at its lowest point in over a decade I mean what are your observations on our levels of food food security at this point yeah I think the first first thing is for us as agriculturists in South Africa uh food security is why we exist um so if you if you if you talk about agriculture um the main goal of Agriculture is to make that the country is food secure so it is indeed a shock when you read through all the documentation and the the the specific reports you refer to maybe just a comment on that so the first thing is uh we need to ask ourselves what is our minds and how do we see food security and I'm talking about all of us because I think sometimes we have a misunderstanding of what the word food security means and so for us as AGI or primary producers in South Africa um we say to ourselves we need to kind of find that and see where we we are lacking and where we are weak and then what we do is we go back and see if we can contribute to better that weakness and turn it into a strength because South Africa has the capacity to make sure that sou all South Africans are food secure um and it should not be so we don't have a lack of food I think that's the first thing we need to say and we've learned through last year's draft uh the mechanisms we put in place and field props specifically uh helped us to be able to uh maintain and sustain food security but food security is not just about having enough food it's also about the availability of food to people it's about um certain diets people are having uh is it safe nutritious so I think there's there's more than just uh the term food security so I think the first thing is there's no fear that we don't have enough food in South Africa we do but there are other factors we need to look into what we need to change and and add yeah and I mean you know just to your point as as you are of course indicating that the problems aren't really or could not necessarily be because we have you know a shortage of food it then makes one wonder you know just in terms of this report that I've just mentioned earlier I mean highlighting one of um you know the points that um you know uh by the South African report is that on average more than more more South Africans in fact experienced greater or deeper food insecurity in 2023 compared to any other year between 2012 and 2023 it then makes one wonder where exactly the gaps lie because we also know of course um that there's been uh extremely high food prices in in this country over the past two or three years yeah I think two things about that um we export about 50% of what we produce and we do that without State um subsidies and we compete with the best in the world so we still could do it so uh affordability is not just the price of f but affordability for us South Africans is the inequality and income um so you have a lot of poverty in South Africa and poor people just don't have the means and ends to buy food so affordability one aspect of affordability is the price of food of which we are uh I would say we can compete with the rest of the world without having subsidy so we can produce food at a very a relative I would say um manageable price however um the income of of the majority of South Africans are not there and they are not able to buy the food so again food security is not an availability of food in the sense we don't have enough food if if people don't have the money to buy food they are food insecure even though the food is on the shelves so um the food prizes in South Africa if you compare it with the rest of the world we are not outrageous and and the the the price of food in South Africa is not above the norm uh by no means uh but there's many other factors that work work into that maybe just something on the affordability um I think climate change is a big one uh and what I mean by climate change is the sporadic change in production due to climate change so if you have a drought there's a there's a shock impact where there's no food and then you have a rise the rise of price of of food that's what we experienced during the co era so um it but then the price of food is not the issue it is climate change and the effect of climate change into the production system that we need to look into to take out the shocks of not having food or not having say regular supply of food on on on in the retailers um space I mean it just brings this the concern though that um even though we do you know have some level of accessibility to food um you still have people dying from hunger and poverty which is a concern So Yesterday of course we saw the Department of Agriculture in guul Natal you know just talking about several programs it has already implemented in the uh drought uh stricken Province including of course assisting subsistence farmers in order to address the ongoing hunger and poverty challenges that we are talking about I mean how important a role do you think does government and the community I might add play here in in in as far as these farmers are concerned so the take of food security is not a farming concept it's not Farmers that kind of create food Security in South Africa it's the the whole food value chain the food system that we utilize from where we produce food until we we get to a point where people can eat or have access to food and in that government plays a major role but but government is one player there are so many players in between um it's shocking if you think that people are still dying in South Africa are not having food it it is it it's not acceptable um but if you just take waste whatever we produce about 30 to 35% is wasted in the food chain from where we produce it until we it reach the um where where it's available for for consumers to buy but that is not just the farming concept government needs to play a role communities need to play a role um retailers need to play a role so you look at the whole food system and I think what what this reporting does and I think the focus from our side on food food Security in South Africa at place a co-responsibility on people to say it's unacceptable that people die of hunger and how do we overcome this and I think government's play is Big where they can play into the management of risk Mitigation Of risks specifically a natural uh disasters like a drought or flood or hail or whatever we want to do with it small small scale people contribute a huge amount to food security specifically in rural areas and the moment that they experience that they they literally do not have the means and access Absolut to finance or to maintain thems to overcome that and and that's where you have a government like an older brother playing playing a greater role into that space and if you think of it it's not actually supporting the farmers it's overcoming food insecurity in that specific place so food security sometimes we think yeah yes absolutely thank you so much unfortunately we have run out of time Yan thank you so much for that of course that's agre CEO Yan as we observe International uh Community World of Food day across of course uh the globe

pNPP3LCiuJA,World Food Day | Food security reaches its lowest point in past 10 ten years: Prof Dieter von Fintel,2024-10-16T12:33:38Z,333,the maiden South African food security index 2024 commissioned by food retailer the shoppr right group suggests that food security has reached its lowest point in the past 10 years developed by economists from the University of Stellenbosch the index evaluates four dimensions namely availability of food access to it utilization of it and overall stability it's a study that spans from 2012 to 2023 the gauge is said to have been at its peak at 64.9 Point in 2019 and then dropping to 45.3 points in 2023 a reading of zero would indicate no food security at all or to unpack the story behind these numbers I'm joined by Professor daa Von fintel he's from the University of Telos thank you very much Prof for joining us so the index you've created is telling us that food insecurity has risen and I suppose that's not much of a surprise as we've been hearing and talking about the the rising cost of living for some time now but of course South Africa has its own unique issues so what were the key takeaways to come from the index yes thank you very much of course it's very problematic for us that food Securities are such a low um we we saw particularly that in the past it came it's always related to droughts currently we got a double issue we've got we're still in the throws of Alo and we also have the external pressures coming from the international markets that there are food availability is a problem from the international markets and this is also because of geopolitical and climate change pressures combined this means that availability is a real problem there is constraints and it means that food costs more just means it's more difficult for people to afford food it contributes to increasing hunger rates and importantly for us I think is is that what it does is means that people are changing their budgets to so that they use cheaper Foods yes and they're buying cheaper foods and those cheaper Foods mean that they're less nutritious and this has long run consequences for people's nutritional status Professor what's your reading of how resilient South Africa's agricultural sector has been to provide the bare minimum to the South African Market even like you say when it's been lashed by climate impacts and animal disease and so on so what we see is in the statistics is is that the production levels have come down because of the drought um in some periods Imports can compensate for this so in that sense there are ways to deal with this but the important thing to notice is is that we actually if we look at just the average food we actually have enough to feed our population one of the bigger constraints is is also being able to get that food onto from the field into the plates and this is the reason why so many South Africans still do go hungry about one in 10 households experience hunger at some point and the the problem with that is is is that uh there is enough availability but the poorest of households are really the people to face the the most constraints to be able to to get into uh to be able to access the food that's on the market yeah Professor it's concern that one of the things that you noted was that child hunger and the stunting of growth has become quite an issue which which of course has major implications uh for people's you know prospects to grow up as fully fledged adults yes that's right I mean we're particularly concerned about stunting um South Africa about one in four children are stunted um which means they're too short for their age so but it's not just a physical thing stunting often predicts what happens into the future the it's a good proxy for nutritional status in other words do children have the right diets and nutrition to be able to perform at school and to be able to eventually get a good job this has really long run consequences to have the right basket of nutrition and the right types of foods especially very early in life so I I think one of the crucial aspects is what we know of as the first Thousand Days uh from conception to 2 years old where very young people really need the right nutrition to be able to succeed in life in future even yes Professor one last thing of course there huge debates raging about whether our grant system is sufficient particularly when it comes to things like the child Grant you know in terms of whether it's sufficient uh to be able to be able to afford Basics you know like food uh do you think that there any policy interventions that need to be made of course everything has a cost yes the gr system we saw historically that it correlates very strongly to reductions in hunger which were very high in the early 2000s and they correlate very strongly especially in rural areas with the reductions in hunger so they do have a way to reducing hunger but they don't eliminate hunger if you think of a grant as not being enough to buy a nutritious basket of food they most certainly aren't enough to also uh give nutritious food which is generally more expensive so what one could do is especially if we want to focus on the first thousand days is we could think of aspects of school feeding programs which currently Target older children how can we target younger children one of the first things one could think of doing is is looking at early childhood development facilities and thinking of feeding programs there and the other thing is is looking at a key basket of very highly nutritious Foods which are cheap enough for poorer households to afford to think of the discussions around zero rating and and being able to make these nutritious Foods also more affordable not just other Foods in general okay Professor daa Von fintel from the University of SOS thank you so much sir for your time and insights there
2h2s5qZlKos,Markets Update | 16 October 2024,2024-10-16T12:22:36Z,322,"onto your markets news now Asian equities were on a downer following the US's Q from the previous day also weighing down on the market was a falling quarterly earnings from French luxury giant lvmh which showed that demand out of China for luxury goods had worsened continuing to indicate the struggles in that economy the Nik share average fell by 1.85% the hangang index closed down 0.16% while the Shanghai Composite Index Rose by 0.052% basically flat US Stocks lost ground US Stocks lost ground in yesterday's trade this on the back of disappointing earnings from Europe's biggest Tech firm asml which resulted in a widespread selloff of chip makers with a drop in Energy prices also having an adverse impact on energy stocks the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 0.75% the S&P 500 fell by 0.76% while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite declined by a greater margin of 1.01% looking at the local market the JSC is flat today with the AllShare index slipping 0.1% standing at 86,000 41 points and the industrial as pardon me the Rand is trading at 17 Rand 57 against the US dollar 2287 against the British pound 1914 Visa V the Euro looking at Commodities gold is trading at $2,675 an ounce Platinum at $990 per ounce while the price of Brent crude oil is trading just shy of $75 a barrel wari Lucas is a portfolio manager at vanani Securities and he's going to help unpack the markets for us a very good afternoon to you wari so us and Asian markets were in the red seemingly on the back of not so Stellar Tech earnings in the United States I suppose it's going to be up and down with the current earnings reporting season yes certainly very much so Nur I mean in in terms of tech you know it goes further than the us as well I mean just think about uh the Dutch chip giant asml for examp example has also just reported uh disappointing results uh so clearly the issues around uh research and development spend in AI um has a broader front than just the US and of course uh in terms of the US chip makers I we're looking at an environment in which politicians on both side are looking at export restrictions to China and that's going to lean on them quite hard as well I think it is important to note in passing though that the companies that make up the big us indices aren necessarily a reflective of the whole US economy so it doesn't mean if tech is in the toilet temporarily that the whole of the US would be yeah when we talk about the luxury goods company lvmh and and and the fact that they haven't done so well why is that a big deal I mean not everybody in China is Rich and can afford to buy a 30,000 dollar bag or watch so why is that indicator so important absolutely I think the the key issue with luxury goods is that they are aspirational so when the spend on luxury goods falls off it's actually a fairly good indicator of consumer sentiment so uh poor spending in China is is a is a very definite indication that the Chinese consumer uh is uh standing with their hands on their pockets and I it's probably not surprising I mean monetary policy China has been very restrictive uh and so that's flowed through into the air yeah so how are you seeing the local market and and the fundamentals here okay so I think some quite positive comments coming out of the Saab for example I mean we we're seeing uh indications from them that they're looking at CPI in the bottom half of the 3 to 6% range within the next three quarters uh and uh they note pricing in the markets um looking for around about 125 basis points of cut so that's a that's that's a fairly positive outlook compared to what we used to from our generally somewhat bearish La I mean if we what we really are looking forward to now I guess is a promising report card from the medium-term budget which happens at month end but what we don't need are obviously um ridiculous tariff hikes from escom or a whole bunch of of load shedding so there's always a some depending depending but our rate cycle should hopefully dominate uh by the same token we obviously don't want bearish news from China to be our problem either and for further news today look how for retail sales data at 230 that could contain a bit more info yeah and then lastly let's take a look at Sasol I did mention in the intro that energy stocks have been hit by you know lower fuel prices or lower oil prices but of course Sasol is a little bit of a different one I see that stock trading at around 112 Rand a share uh do you think it will ever get back to those days of trading at 400 round a share well I think sholder certainly hope so uh I think in terms of commodity Outlook generally I mean we need to keep an eye on the Trump trade uh I.E will who's going to win I mean that the Republican outcome generally not positive for commodity producers because it generally would mean an opening of the Taps for oil but I think there are quite good shock absorbers for for sassle I mean the the the current price that they receive uh given where the Rand is and where oil prices are they they they are generally profitable uh and the Northern Hemisphere winter Outlook um albeit that it's been a little warmer than average um it should still be okay for them um so yeah all in all I think the the valuations on sassel quite attractive current consent on them is a buy so I think that sassle can recover but it's got a way to go before it gets that old Blue Chip status back right thank you so much wari for your time and insights there war Lucas he's a portfolio manager at vanani securities"

0P39c2aVaZw,Tito Mboweni | SACP pays tribute - Samkele Maseko reports,2024-10-16T10:41:22Z,10317,right on to this now tributes still pouring in for former Finance Minister dito bweni friends and comrades in some instances are still arriving at his home in Kilani that's in Johannesburg to pay homage uh to the former Reserve Bank governor so there isbc news reporter Sam maso who joins us now live and Sam I imagined we're going to be seeing much of what's taking place there until the funeral on Saturday indeed I under many political leaders and players are coming to the resident of the former Finance Minister former minister of Labor and former governor of The Reserve Bank Mr Tito Titus moeni here at this particular residence of his in Johannesburg the family will be leaving on Thursday afternoon and going to Mahaba CL where he resided and where the official Category 2 State funeral will take place this morning the Sap's General Secretary soim afria mapaya is here alongside some of the Central Committee members and the leaders of the young communist League to the family of Tito very good morning to you Mr M just the comments from the afcan Communist party and the message of condolences to the B family thank you very much um we came here of course to pay tribute to comrade ditto moeni and to extend our mess of condolences to his family and to the comrades in The Liberation movement um because this was one of our outstanding caders um who resented colonialism and apartate and decided to fight against it and as Minister uh in our first democratic government under President Nelson Mandela he distinguished himself by driving a thoroughgoing legislative uh process um implemented for instance uh the employment Equity uh act as well as the Labor Relations U act that was um amended and quite Progressive and also implemented affirmative action uh legislation within the framework of the working workplace this legislation was extremely important uh for South Africa and I always used to tease him that uh he shouldn't have gone back to he shouldn't have gone to the Reserve Bank he should have went to a different Ministry for instance like mining where he could have enforced that legislation to empower communities uh as a whole rather than what it has turned out to be where for instance white colonialists uh continues to rule the country they economy and we are reaching a situation where South Africa is recolonizing itself um by the kind of political decisions that we are making and I think um uh many people like him who fought against colonialism will deeply understand the point that we are raising as a Communist party because we are we are not we should not be guided by politics of convenience uh such that the political Elite should find themselves um living far above the people and the economy is not transforming uh people in The Villages uh where he come from originally where I I believe you'll be buried um their lives are not improving and we can find many justifications why it is taking too long when actually it should not be taken too long it's precisely because we have never transferred economy economic power and wealth of society to the majority we have left it in the hands of a a white capitalist minority uh that continues to dominate the political and social sphere of our society this is a critical question that must be addressed but of course coming here to pay tribute to comrade dito uh was well liked by many South Africans for his conduct for his behavior for his humility at a revolutionary you can see even way State uh a man that has uh done so much has succeeded so well even in in in private life in accumulation but he he remained a humble guy um of course um many people will know he loved even um his mop wors the the lyar fish I always used to say that ideologically the only thing me and him agreed was was about the ly star fish because I enjoyed too so these are the only things that uh we used to have easy discussions with him he was a humble comrade comrade and I think the movement and the people of South Africa have lost one of their best politically have you had any engagement with him prior to him departing the land of the living on the composition of the government of national Unity I know some of the conversations we would have he was pretty much riously against thec working with the Democratic Alliance and the freedom front plus well we we had not discussed at length he simply said that um if he gives me his thoughts h i i i I'll create chaos and he said no the best thing is that we should still find time to have our dinner at makas where he was regarded as the chair of makas and he said no come here um let's enjoy fish and um and have deeper engagement about the current processes but I used to tease him that no you are like all other ministers uh particularly in the finance sector they've good ideas before they go in once they in the ministry they run away from real issues when they are out uh they say something for instance we we we spoke to him about the introduction of um the public Bank the public banking system to to break the Monopoly of this capitalist bank that have Strang that have a strangle hold on our economy and when he was Minister he was reluctant to drive this thing and the then H head of ANC economics Department commission comrade Enoch was more or less receptive to this idea and when itto left he started tweeting that no let's transform the African Bank into a public bank and the thing that he he could not do when he was there and the one who was now in was is now reluctant to do the same thing so we used to laugh about it but the biggest issue about this transition is that uh people like him are are deeply aware about the many mistakes that we are committing as a country um and they have given advises like uh what what he did in with regard to the banking sector particularly when he had no uh obligations to International Capital with regard to the finances and the economy and he expressed himself about um more especially the transformation of the banking sector but to the extent that when I worked with him sometime during the elections campaign we did a a a a joint program in limo where he was also in makas area where he was also trying to organize the white Community um in that particular area because it was committed to non-racialism and it should not be that when we criticize racism and the continued concentration of wealth of this country in white minority hands uh it shouldn't be portrayed as been racist because some of our comrades are beginning to think that way H to to basically say we can't talk transformational issues and point out where the economy of this country continues to lie when the majority of people cannot afford life itself so it is in this regard that um we need to raise this issues sharply like he did and I hope that the political leadership in this country at one point they will H move away from this lies that they want to accept themselves that the people of this country voted for Unity of parties there's not such a thing how can the people of this country vote for poverty no the people of this country want a party that can transform the economy of this country H bring radical changes and yet unite the people of this country they cannot say we vote for a status quo the status quo is poverty of the majority and this is a thing that we must attack and defeat and even H take out this thing that the government of national Unity is trying to portray to the to society that this is the will of the people there's no will of the people there's no will of the people in which a party with 20% want to control 80% of government's decision and posture the re introduction of a deeper free market economic system that is capitalist system that has failed this country over decades a poison of this nature cannot reapply it again and think that the patient will be better you are actually finishing the patient as soon as it's possible this is what this journey will do to our country why did you snap the ANC meeting with the officials you meant to have a bilateral meeting African with the ANC as African Communist party why did you snap that meeting on Monday you know the problem with the media is that we wanted to pay tribute to to Tito we don't want to go deeper into politics but certainly uh we could not go to that celebration of the gnu not the celebration of the gnu a letter was sent to you as the GS for the bilateral meeting 7 on 7even what happened okay that letter uh Sam was not even sent from thec we requested for the meeting we sent a letter first because I think there's an impression that the NC invited us we did not go we wrote the the request for a meeting uh sometime in early in August when we realized that many things were were developing and the alliance was not able to meet the political councel but we wanted a discussion of the the bilateral discussion between us and the and thec and the ANC conf firmed first the meeting for the 23rd of September when the president was in the UN and we refused to to have a meeting without the Pres present that's where it started and secondly we agreed on this H the the date on Monday for our bilateral and later on we learned that the was going to have a celebration of the gnu just after our meeting and we felt that was disrespectful H that meant uh whatever we're going to discuss uh didn't mean anything to the ANC they know our position on regarding the the government of national unity and we could not go to a meeting where immediately after that an hour after the NC joins the celebrations of the gnu and also were expected to be part of as as a as members of the ANC so on that basis we made it very clear that we would rather not even have that bilateral that day so there's clarity about about that particular issue this question of the gnu uh uh we take it very serious as the sap because of its ability to reverse the gain of our Revolution uh the the the manner in which it has reinforced whitis uh the behavior of white supremacy that has been H engendered or encouraged as you can see with the behavior largely of people like Helen Zill and everything else now even their attitude uh condensating attitude of interfering in the Affairs of thec now the DA for instance is so much worried about uh matters in the ANC about paza Sufi this paza Sufi that why why we even allow the da to interfere in the ncfs so it is this kind of things that are really worrying us but the biggest issue is the control of the direction of our society by a minority party a racist party that comes from colonialism the reasons why this country is poor so in short you snapped thec on Monday simply put no we rejected to be associated with the gnu processes will you further engage with them if they call into a bilateral meeting no of course we said so we also wrote them a new letter a letter indicating the reason why we are not coming to that particular meeting and are recommitted to have a discussion proper discussion we don't want to have a a small a brief discussion about matters of this nature afflicting our society I mean it's a almost 100 days or more than that uh since the the election four months since the elections and the alliance has not met I mean that's that that that shows the lack of seriousness about uh what we are faced with as a revolutionary movement a revolutionary movement doesn't conduct itself this way but during the gnu period I can tell you some of the leaders were meeting almost every day but today they can't even find time to have discussions about the fate of our Revolution so in essence you're are saying that the da is more taken seriously by the NC Secretary General fig balula the custodian of ANC meetings then they take you as the sap not fig balula the ANC takes the da more seriously now than it does its Alliance partners and that's where the problem is why are you giving an instruction for Bladen zand for David maso and for the former SEC General Secretary of the young communist League bu maname to resign from government as members of the Central Committee of the party no they don't have to they don't have to resign the the the the the the wrong message that has been uh provided in society is that we have no communist firstly in the in government okay those people are not Communists they are communist party members they are ANC members in their own right they've been deployed as such byc we have no single one accountable to the Communist party if thec was to say comade s and so is accountable to you then we we will withdraw that particular person there's no one that is accountable to us all of them are accountable to the ANC so this matter it's a is the lowest level of political engagement in society it should not be entertained uh because it's irrelevant to the current discussion the NC and us at the alliance have got a concept of dual membership so we understand the authority of of of members if we have asked one of our comrade to go into government on the Mandate of the African National Congress that person is responsible to the African National Congress uh it's the ANC that makes him accountable we in the collective will meet together politically to say how are our comrades in government conducting themselves so it doesn't even arise this matter in this form we don't even control for instance comr blade as Minister as the Communist party is under the the the accountability framework of the African National Congress we only engage with him to the extent of our expectations as as as as a Communist Party about his conduct and so forth as as would be other members in government so that matter doesn't Arise at all the 202s says you're a fake communist H it doesn't deserve my response to that thank you very much that Isa who is the General Secretary of the saan Communist party they are paying homage to their fallen struggle starart Tito and also speaking on issues pertaining to the government of national Unity saying that they would have not honored a meeting where the ANC would have later gone to celebrate the gnu all right Sam maso thanks as always helping us cover all our bases and so far as that story and several others are concerned some reporting live there from Kilani in Johannesburg

E6zjzYTk2BI,World Food Day | Right to food for a better life - Gershon Naidoo weighs in,2024-10-16T10:08:56Z,401,"as many as 309 million people are facing acute levels of food insecurity across the globe that's at least according to the world food programs 2024 data South Africa also has its own fair share of problems that contribute to the issue in fact the country faces challenges ranging from high unemployment and poverty to the rising cost of living the cost of food is a particularly sensitive um you know issue considering recent reports of poison food in some areas now as the International Community observes this world food day uh let's find out what role Grassroots interventions can play in averting hunger food insecurity and malnutrition for that let's welcome our guest gersa Naidu is the marketing director of Meals on Wheels Community Service South Africa and joins us now via our video link Chan it's great to see you thanks very much indeed for making time to speak to us perhaps let's just Begin by getting a better understanding of the situation in our own country you know I typically find that if you yourself are not food insecure you typically have a very warped idea about how big the problem is yes um statistics are scary in South Africa at the moment um we we talking about one in three people that don't have access to a a plate of food a simple thing like food when we think about all the food that is around us and to think that there are people that are going to bed starving tonight it is really really a scary thing yeah and what do we find is typically at the heart of this because what I've heard in the past is that in fact enough food is being produced but it seems our distributions aren't the way they should be oh that is a very very loaded question um again statistics says that there are 10 um the the food that has been wasted will pull 10 soccer pitchers that is the amount of food that is actually being wasted in South Africa um there's so many contributing factors to why people are not getting food and of course we know that unemployment is one of them um you know unemployment on the one side being one of them but access to jobs um there's just so many things we can talk about that's why I said your question is very loaded no fair enough perhaps let me just try Zone in on one of the aspects for one um who typically are the contributors to this wastage because you know perhaps that's a good place to start as we try better understand whether or not they are best place to make sure the food goes to those who need it yeah I think uh the challenges that we having as a nonprofit organization that Meals on Wheels is regulations um that prohibit regulations and legislation that prohibit the distribution of food so for example um food that um is um served in a buffet at a hotel cannot be given away or distributed it has to be thrown away um and we are are really struggling to get into this um we seeing a lot of our mainstream uh supermarkets now allowing nonprofit organizations to come in and use what we call the best before food you know the food that is just about to expire that allows us to cook and prepare the food but I think the wastage of food um also belongs with each one of us as individuals in South Africa if we look at what food is left over after a meal uh nine out of 10 times we take that and throw it away whereas we could package it um drop it off at a nonprofit organization or even carry it in our cars and that person that knocks on our window at every robot um or traffic light um we can give that and that will already start making a difference in the plight of the hungry that um we have in South Africa yeah fair enough my the information I have my disposal uh says that you've been able to establish over 100 odd Community kitens perhaps you can let us in on what it's taken to get those going yes um lots of hard work dedication and a huge amount of volunteerism um we have now currently in all nine 181 kitchens that's serving the communities um that they are situated in and some of them driving as far as 30 kilometers from their kitchen to distribute um those meals I think um I would be failing if I don't say thank you to the many many uh corporates the many individual donors um the many volunteers and staff that man these kitchen making it possible for us to feed approximately 200,000 people every single day and you know I'll just give you one example at one of our branches um every single morning there's a line at 6:00 that all the homeless people are being fed and at first the local businesses started you know saying you you're attracting all these homeless people to your kitchen you know it doesn't look very nice but after 2 or 3 months they came to thank us because those homeless are not now worrying their uh customers and actually are now supporting that program so this is what we need to see more of and what we need to do more of take care of those around us yeah you know we sometimes just restrict this conversation to people having something in their belly but my goodness the impact is so much further reaching than that for lack of a better term you know if people specifically children are wellfed they're able to focus hopefully in class goodness me hopefully they're able to contribute to society and ultimately everybody wins so this is not just about you know meals in people's place which is of course an important aspect of it but if you think about it in the long term the country ultimately benefits absolutely um and it's interesting uh we had a meeting with one of our our donors and they said they did a re they did research and they noticed that there's a lot less social unrest where they there is a kitchen uh a Meals on Wheels kitchen and you know we didn't even realize that just feeding people is contributing so much to the peacefulness of our country and also you know we we we want to go a step further and we even want to we even now training our beneficiaries to prepare their own meals um with the different uh projects that we have uh within Meals on Wheels yeah I want to just go back to something you've mentioned which I think might have piqued the interest of many people listening this around regulation sometimes making it difficult to ensure we reduce our wastage do you have in mind a solution to something like that I mean because I understand part of the reason why for example food from a buffet can't just be shared is that sometimes it may actually cause health risk right and we've seen enough of those kind of stories in our country so where's that sweet spot um between ensuring there isn't a westage and of course protecting the the people who need the food yeah maybe my thinking is a bit too simplistic but you know we deliver cooked food every day that's part of our job and there is a cycle that we need to follow a very strict cycle that we need to follow to make sure that the food is preserved correctly the temperatures are correct before it is being served um just the number of night shelters we have and is not going to take a lot of time for the food to reach those buffets from the buffets to the night shelters it's simple things like that that legislation can put in place um you know how to transport the food the the amount of time it takes for the food to reach the buffet table to the meals uh to the beneficiaries um I think that sometimes we are more concerned about um you know what possible risks and then people are going hungry instead of us putting processes in place to manage the risk I don't know if I'm making sense to you no absolutely um like I said it's there must be a sweet spot in between some where um that will benefit everyone in one way or the other I see there's a lot of focus being placed on not just giving people food but making sure that that food is nutritious how much of a challenge is that for you and your organization um we are very uh strict on what constitutes a plate of food in our organization and I think the biggest challenge for us is access to that food even for us as as as a big uh uh organization um we like to make sure that there's protein um and all the necessary um ingredients on a plate of food um it is really really difficult but I I must say um you know being 60 years old I think we found the sweet spot and you know we thank God that the food that we serve is really really nutritious just by the fact that when our vehicles come they are long lines and big smiles and and and you know really that is how the the success of your organization is measured by the smiles and the appreciation you get from the beneficiaries the food smells good it looks good and is absolutely tasty yeah I can see the smile on your own face suggesting that this really means something and you know I suppose it's a good way as we close off our discussion to try and personalize the discussion if we can you know when we typically speak to I don't know volunteers from gift of the givers you'll find that the reason for the work they do is is personal you know there's usually a an anecdote or something like that that put them in a position where they carry out what I reckon to be vocational work you know something tells me you're not necessarily making the most money but nonetheless you're there and hoping to make a difference um so perhaps if people are wondering if they should think of being volunteers you can share to us your why as you you know continue to contribute to the organization yeah um I started many years ago 34 years ago as a volunteer for Meals on Wheels and you know it was just a stop gap for me in my life until I found what I really wanted to do and 34 years later I'm still at Meals on Wheels I think the joy we get when we make a difference in one person's life when we can just put a smile on one person's face and going to bed at night knowing that one person has a full tummy or is experiencing life or has their dignity restored to them I think that's what makes the difference it's not about the money it's not about the titles it's just about the ability to make a difference in somebody's life I think that's what drives all of us at Meals on Wheels whether it's our volunteers whether it's our full-time staff it's just that ability to change a person's life with a simple thing like a plate of food yeah absolutely and as we've spoken that plate of food of course can go a really long way gersa n you thanks very much indeed for speaking to us we appreciate your time and wish you all the very best as you continue with the important work that you're doing for"
1yUBl-epzlc,"SA, India & Brazil naval capability demonstration under way in Cape Town - update",2024-10-16T09:16:16Z,2519,the eighth edition of a naval exercise which includes vessels from India Brazil and here in South Africa continues today the drills will entail Maneuvers at close proximity and boarding operations watching developments for us is Vanessa Puna who joins us now live and Vanessa perhaps you can help us locate where you are as we take in some of these Maneuvers as it's been described um why is this important aanda yes good morning to you at the moment is Simon's Bay in the fals in the fals bay um area of of Cape Town and of course we are um at sea for uh the continuation of uh six days of Naval exercises between the Navies of South Africa Brazil and India um a short while ago we spoke to uh the uh officer commanding of the SAS Amat that's of course the vessel that we're on at the moment a South African frigate um about the importance and he was talking to um the kinds of exercises for example simulations around War situation simulations around piracy um and this helps and assist the various uh naval officers and teams uh to prepare for events uh similar to these uh real life events of that nature and of course it also builds um trust and communication as well as sharing of information um among those participa participating countries in a short while um we'll see demonstrations including helicopters earlier this morning up until now we've also had some sort of close Captain do we call it close maneuvers of the three vessels and of course I'm joined Now by uh Captain D Jones of course officer commanding of the Sasa in terms of um training so so Captain you were speaking to me earlier on about the importance of these kind of Naval exercises um for sustainability of the Navy itself but also for for training of young seaf farers explain to us what kind of training um you know the various uh disciplines would find in a naval exercise like this yeah thank you very much it's exactly that the whole nature of an exercise like this is based on developing skills and um I think one of the most rewarding things for me as officer commanding of the ship during this exercise was to see how the young officers and and members on board have developed in their competence their skills their knowledge base and also their confidence levels so that is an experience that nobody can take take away from them I'm sure it's similar to the um experiences that the Indian ship and the Brazilian ship has experienced during these days at Sea and um these experiences will stand the leadership or the future leadership of the organization in good stead no one will be able to take it away so the experiences gained is not only the the various exercises that we've done but also composing yourself in an environment which is stressful um the conditions of the sea managing that and then executing the job that you've been trying to for so very valuable exercise um up to this point let me just recap I mean uh we just um outside the bridge over here and I also see quite a number of young people um let's talk about um you know uh career opportunities within the Navy and I think we we speak about this quite often um in terms of what we've seen the various role players involved with here this morning just a short while ago with with anchoring yeah the the compos composition of this crew on amatola currently we're about 155 people on board um and it's a it's a large number because it requires various skills it's a complex complex machine um and we have women men and women on board of various um ages various skill levels and obviously specific um training and qualifications um it goes all the way from basic navigation from the bridge side all the way to the engineering side we're also in independent ship so that means we have a logistic team with their officer with their teams on board does all the logistic requirements Fuel and food and and they do the flying which you're going to observe just now um we've got personnel which does the HR part for the the organization and then we've got skilled um members which will include engineering weapons engineering um and then operators um so there's a vast array of skills that is required to operate the ship the men and women as you've pointed out are young and that's a good thing because uh we want a the organization to be rejuvenated and we require the young people to hone their skills and this is exactly what we're busy with uh 6 days at Sea already as part of this um ipsa um exercise um when does it culminate and of course um what does this mean once it's completed where to from here for the various navies involved in this in this Naval exercise yeah so um it is it's it's sad that we are finishing the exercise today because we're just starting to get into the swing of things but um the the exercise culminates this afternoon um the ships will proceed back alongside and the friendships that we built um we will we will continue with for today and tomorrow and then tomorrow it will be a sad farewell because a lot of the young people on board has really enjoyed the engagement with um the foreign navies it will before many of them it would be would have been the first and it was wonderful to see how they interacted um between uh the various cultures um we share a common culture which is the naval culture Naval Traditions um and we do things similarly but it was wonderful to have new friendships built um and it will be a sad sad forw well the the the other vessels tomorrow so their stay in simonstown is cut short but um yeah it was a great time together with them Captain thank you so much for that update for of course the officer commanding of the SAS amatola uh Captain dto Jones just updating as the aanda on uh the culmination or the end if one can call it that of this Naval exercise it's the eighth edition um and still some more simulations uh we expecting to take place here in Simon's Bay in the fals bay Coast in Cape Town
-9vrCJv9oaw,Stories Untold | Bonamelo Melisizwe Foundation,2024-10-16T09:13:48Z,418,Community Based organizations npos should go back to the simplest definitions of why we exist to be symbols of Hope M they exist to help uh that's their slogan and really they exist to help Bono is a is a good person um I take him as my role model it was nice I designed my own website this kind of this is stories told the home of good news I am MTI the bearer of those good news today would like to to introduce you to yet another change maker we have a lot I know definitely in your community there is someone who's driving change and we would like to share their story on stories un told today though we are taking a journey with philanthropist buo M he does really incredible things with people with disabilities as well as unemployed youth we're about to find out who the man is but we'll also like you to pay close attention to the work that he has done with children who have cerebal paly and how he has been able to provide a safe heaven as well as a center for these children B is an enthusiastic young man from davidon who is very zil about his community and fostering meaningful change to improve the well-being of his community he was recently recognized and awarded for his contribution to activism and Civil Society at the inaugural youth Legacy Excellence award we caught up with him to follow his journey on being a Cassi hero I'm born and bred in davidon so when I got the opportunity to see other things outside of the township set up um it started bothering me the thing of why is it that even if it's just me at the time um but why is there no motivation to bring these kind of encouraging things in the townships and one realizes that it's almost like a system it's set that way but every system is set by a person you know and I guess it bothered me until I did not want to be bothered without doing something one of the key areas of the foundation is to play a hand in encouraging a well-rounded and enlightened generation of leaders through programs focused on Youth Development and poverty interventions one notable program is the Cassi coders Kini which provides essential coding and website development skills to more than 18 Learners from four high schools in davidon in this coding and web development program um that started earlier this year we started with um handpicking um your top Achievers um across your 10 and 11s in in in the neighborhood high schools and we've got now a group of 18 Learners we certificated the first part of it which was in May the the 18 we started with 20 and then of course some will always fall off but I think you know we've had a good outcome where we now ended off with 18 so now that was your basic coding and web development where they were able at that time to build build an actual website so now that coding and web development program has been now the final leg of the pilot we've just started two weeks ago and we will be certificating again in October now they should be fully fledged to um start uh and then billing people for those Services as well and why particularly in terms of that it's not necessarily just because of the trend of coding this for that is that we realize that um the biggest thing in in our Township communities is is is pocket money you know self- sustenance and if we teach them these skills from an early age and we make sure that we incubate them and build clients for them they can perfect these skills before they even get to vity came and approach me he asked the forers so from grade 11 and grade 10 and my section I was looking at the Learners that are not the Learners that are willing not Learners that are intelligent but those Learners must be willing so I chose some of the Learners that they were not they didn't have an interest in this coding but there were those when I announced they were willing so I managed to choose those Learners because of their willingness in this coding the program's impact is profound Learners expressed their excitement and pride at being selected for the boot camp which boosted their self-confidence and motivated them I didn't know anything about coding I was clueless hence when I started the program I was clueless on of on how to use the laptop I didn't know how to use the laptop but they um the teachers here the program were were patient with me and they taught me each and every step that I I need to know the buelo foundation is helpful to me because um you know on weekends all you do is watch TV and go and play with your friends but with the foundation and the program that they gave to us I can say I'm learning a lot instead of staying home and playing I'm gaining knowledge which I can use to make my own money like creating a website for a business a local business so with buo it doesn't only empowers us but it always it also empowers um local businesses which I can help and create their websites so they can make their businesses well known when we started it was easy coding but now we are we are learning a new language which is called JavaScript it's diff but I think um when times goes I will Master it and coding I think yesterday I was searching about um coding coding jobs um I found that there are there are companies that want to hire uh coders web develop web development coders yes so I think um when I'm done with school I do it as a side hustle I just got picked I did not know Mr Bono I had no idea that was going to be part of um a GIC Coda program that lasted that long um so I got to learn a new coding language I got to learn um website development which was great because even now I can create my own website it's a way of me making money um for small businesses like Mr B always says that we don't gain the knowledge J Mahala you can utilize it anywhere you can make your own future you um with the employment rates increasing with the experience that we have we can create employment for ourselves first time 1.0 it was nice I designed my own website and then secondly the success of the kasas has given the students confidence and they are more focused on their studies as they joined it they are so participating in class they are disciplined and you can see that what they are doing there they are very interested because they normally come to me one say that I want to do this I want to use this coding in order to do the business of the restaurant open my restaurant in future I have learned that so they are so excited they have the the positive objectives in of using this coding our Learners are pushing us now um to make sure that these programs keep going on for example with the coding program when we certificated it was also an awards ceremony which will also be an award ceremony at the end of this second leg of it and um we had giftings such as brand new laptops you know um and gift bags for for for everyone else and the one that won um you find that now they are intentionally wanting to bridge that Gap and starting to make um additional revenue for themselves just in terms of the concept that we had hand and they are the ones who are rushing back and saying guys um I'm coming here to beat you guys and then you find that now it is not us pushing for the school to say guys can you please have your learners and things it's the Learners that are pushing the school schools to say please support us we want to be part of this program stories un told a platform for ordinary people to share their Journeys but also to show you ordinary people who do incredible things because it's when we see people that look like us and talk like us that we see that we also can do what they do so we're all about driving change in this particular segment we hear from people who have had the impact or the benefit of working with our featured guest buelo today and these are the beneficiaries of all the projects that he has been a part of let's go straight there we continue to follow Bono as he does his philanthropical work around his community through his efforts of championing communities to work together a center taking care of children living with autism and cerebral poliy is fast becoming a safe haven for the kids the center was established by they have been struggling with recognition and support this is up until they met with the buelo foundation it's for kssm Cal py it's the damage of spal court so they can't do anything forsel 247 we have three services first service it's a drop in they come and go second service it's a s Monday to Friday Friday they go home and then full 247 we take care of them 24/7 we need to make sure they've got food they've got uh toiletries the place is clean they clean so it's a lot and uh since Rel areed with the Social Development but we don't have health certificate as yet certificate to be up to standard right according to requirements Department of Health two the whole place as a startup establishment the center fell victim into the hands of scammers this was before they met with the buam foundation the foundation managed to build trust with the center and together they organized a walk to raise funds to keep the place afloat the walk was a success Okay we needes okay the tight stimulation CER and then we had and then they also reinstalled they reinstalled rails K rails okay we continued we were able to get groceries after four months 50 kgs so we met those people through iono Foundation working with the foundation I've also learn isn't like how to use um communication effectively about how to Market yourself from the foundation they exist to help uh that's their slogan and really they exist to help so I wish they can get more donors sponsorship the foundation also runs an annual food pcel drive that seeks to eradicate poverty in this community they do this through the collaboration of local leaders and churches yes Pastor tulani was to collaborate with the buo foundation reception has been amazing because in this kind of recently we had on the 9th of a came to our church uh and then there was a lot of people that actually came and more than what we expected in our community we've got a lot of people who are unemployed so You' find that there is maybe one and there are also many so as the church we thought with the resources little sources that we have to the community community based organizations npos should go back to the simplest definitions of why we exist to be symbols of Hope most of us lose that definition because we have adopted finances as a symbol of hope so now if I don't have money that means I can't help you and I am saying that is not the case with us we are the symbol of Hope is is that um there's a lot of poverty and so organization especially to cover those areas number one whereby we are able to give groceries to aband and that's number one but then number two I SKS development people's a lot of we are mostly focused on problems that we are aware of and I myself personally am impacted by so we don't go outside the box and try to find something to be relevant we are fixing or trying to play a part in current problems is the founder of the buelo Mel Foundation he is a big Visionary and AER he is currently turning his family home into an ICT Center he hopes to bring all his resources into one H to make his Services accessible and known to the community it's meant to be an ICT Center and to promote um your fourth Industrial Revolution and be relevant build the township potential so we'll have training rooms here we've got two training rooms that we can turn into um your computer rooms as well because most of the facilitation will be through the use of computers and all sorts of nice fancy gadgets of course we don't have them now but Vision you know so though that's what we'll start using at the moment these rooms for that um we will keep doing our best to hire out equipment partner with people who can but those are little problems you know and then we've got a room as well we know that reading is a huge thing in one of these rooms we're going to have as well a library you know to ensure that our Learners can read and teach them as as well and help them progress in terms of reading and writing we want to be a support structure to the education framework of the country in whatever it means you know so that we can be entrusted as well that the responsibility is not fully on the schools but from us as a community as a whole given the unemployment rate in South Africa some beneficiaries from the foundation end up volunteering to gain skills and experience this is something that the foundation is proud of we do have volunteers I think currently we have a group of about 10 volunteers and then there's mix um we can say that about 60% of our volunteers um are in the unemployment space and they they it's just a blessing you know to have people who are giving their all to make sure that that you know this thing that is in your heart can come to fruition and then the other half you find that whenever they can of course there are other commitments and then we trying to All Play A Part we have limited resources but in collaboration good person um I take him as my role model um I've learned a lot of things from him um and I I I want to say thank you for for the laptop I won the laptop ATO Foundation we wereing websites and I CED the best website I hope M and the foundation they continue and Empower gassi gassi ghetto ghetto Learners because we are not privileged and they came to us and they offered us their program without wanting anything from us in return so I hope they continue and Empower others as well as well because like with them I have learned a lot they helped us a lot for instant installing because it was something expensive for us since n that is not funded instes it was one of the biggest issue it's a health hazard for them so them Bono never misses an opportunity to do great things that will benefit the community as we are first approaching the festive season he's currently running a land to swim program that will teach the community about water safety so now um when we got the opportunity to partner up again with other organizations and play a part in um introducing learn to swim programs and water safety awareness and education as well of course you know I'll always jump and say listen I'm game what can we do and we launched water Champions this year again where we went around um the Township Schools as well and we were targeting it for the primary school age as well I I I I am a firm believer that we need to start them whilst they are young and we'll keep growing from there so that is something that as well that for fors part of our youth development arm um when it comes to now the part of sports and recreation and promoting that of course um this is what we are doing with what we have and the campaigns will keep on growing and the programs as well gaining strength as and when we get collaborators on board and partners and sponsors on board something like that but we are not waiting for them to come first for us to do something we are digging deep in terms of what we have and then starting out something like that a big thank you to our featured guest for giving us access into their lives but sharing the work that they do it is through people like buelo that we know that every single change that we would like to see in our communities within ourselves in personal spaces professional spaces it's definitely possible so do not wait for someone to come and rescue your situation or hope that one day is one day yes one day is one day but that change definitely starts with you that's how I'd like to end our show for today I'll be back next week same time same place I can make it I believe that it's possible

UnjhNaiY7q0,Rapelego Primary School | 4 pupils still in hospital - Steve Mabona shares more,2024-10-16T08:46:39Z,2272,four of the 48 pupils hospitalized for suspected food poisoning in new eus near hamc are still being treated the children from rabelo primary school were rushed to different medical facilities this week after they allegedly consumed chocolate that was apparently sold by a grade seven people at the school the incident of course is the latest in a string of tragedies including one where six children died in N lady Ino after they allegedly consumed contaminated food bought from a local spaza shop watching the situation near ham is our reporter who joins us now live from R primary school that's the institution at the center of what took place and I suppose non the question for now is you know what parents and the housing education department are saying about this given the fact that it seems now there's a trend of these kind of food incidents or food poisoning incidents in the province uh it's a very good morning to you ayanda and the viewers at home indeed we are at Rao Primary School in estess north of Petoria where 48 Learners consumed chocolates on Monday which were allegedly sold by a grade six learner uh ay we hear that this 48 Learners were quickly rushed to uh the nearby hospitals including George mukari uh Jubilee and also ODI hospital but fortunately enough 47 Learners were later uh discharged on Monday and also on Tuesday but there was only one learner who is still in hospital we will hear about the developments uh or rather the update on how the larner is doing uh this uh food poisoning incident it's it's becoming a trend right now because if we look back we're still in October but there has already been three incidents that has happened earlier this month there were 47 1 4 Learners I'm sorry there were 74 Learners uh that were from different schools that were attending a metric camp in forville secondary school that also ate poison and not just long ago just a week ago six Learners died also of food poisoning but with me now we have the hting Department of Education spokesperson who who is going to tell us more about this situ and also give us an update on what's really happening with the L who's in hospital right now good morning Mr MAA can you please tell us what really happened on Monday when the this situation transpired yes indeed um quite sad what happened here at the school on Monday U we understand that this child who sold the chocolates actually um she took them from home uh that's the information we got from the school that um the uncle brought the chocolates uh allegedly he bought them somewhere on his way home around town Petoria um and uh brought them home and they they had them during weekend we uh we understand and then the child brought some to come and sell it the school and uh that's where we then experience a problem of the children that we had to rush to different medical facilities and fortunately there were those that were were just observed and and released on the day that is on Monday and they are back at school now uh those that were discharged yesterday uh they are not at school there's only a few that are here but most of them they're not at the school and understandably so so we expect them probably from tomorrow to come at the school and they will continue the process of of supporting the school uh what is the current situation of the learner who is still in hospital um remember we yesterday we had about four who were still at uh different facilities and later at night we then got confirmation that the three were then discharged and only one that is remaining in a private medical facility um the family did confirm that the child will be discharged today but what we need to do just make make inroads and check on whether uh it will be this morning or later in the day but there is information that the child might be discharged today and what is the department doing to support the kids that were in hospital we have sent our psycho support team to come to the school um mainly to assess if there's a psycho support that they need to provide but more so we took a decision you know between ourselves and the Department of Health to say we need to do awareness program uh school health education which encompass is US educating on food management nutrition how do you manage food how do you detect that food might have a you know challenges so that you don't consume and where to buy where not to buy because at this level you need to educate because this is a it's a primary school need to impart knowledge and make sure that children understand so we'll be contining with that program at this school and all other school in the area so so far Mr ma did you discover anything about this chocolates because we understand that there's been uh an ingoing investigations on what what is really happening now we understand that the uncle um and the family went to the police already and um samples were given to health authorities so they would have to provide necessary tests and um will update us on the work that they're doing so we will focus on uh what is in our payview as you can see that curriculum delivery continues children are in the classes uh we continue with the with the curriculum delivery uh Mr maana this incident uh the food poisoning thing is becoming much of a trend more especially in houting this is the third incident and we still in October it's only the 16th of October but we're already having the third incident what is the department doing just so this thing can decrease because it's it's becoming too much no we just need to work together with governance sgbs represent parents so in nature we need to work together and make sure that our schools are safe but in imparting knowledge um because if things happen outside uh our environment it becomes difficult uh to can even police that as a department but the only thing is to impart knowledge and make sure that you know sgbs you know who work with them they understand where we vendors outside our schools they need to know what products can be brought there and how are they are they being managed because it's inevitable that we not going to have a vendors in in in our prin we do have because they want to make money and some you know children need those products because they would have been given money at home so we just need to to manage but um the incident that occurred at forville it was just unfortunate because um it was a camp with the girls Learners only uh the Educators there and stuff they ate the same food and um initially lers that were impacted were about 40 but we understand when we you know visited the school that they 30 lers also went into the transportation that went to the hospital some you know anxious of what is happening because that's the report that we got because on arrival at hospital they didn't even you know waste much time with them because they were fine so it was just an alarm that was cost the number 73 yes what was many but those that we impacted about 40 and we are waiting for the tests on whether is it the food or is there anything that Learners would have went through because the Educators ate I mean when I visited the the camp uh you know they had dinner there all other children because they were back they were discharged all of them they were eating you know that food Educators were eating they even invited me to say you can join us and eat the food there's nothing wrong I visited the kitchen where the food is um cooked well-managed kitchen and the service provider is a parent so the parent will have the best interest of the children at heart because among others there's a children of theirs who will be eating that food so we I wait for the test uh so that the health professionals can indicate on whether was there anything wrong with the food or probably there was something that was uh troubling those children uh thank you so much Mr ma for your time that was the department spokesperson Steve maona giving us the Insight of what really happened aand like you heard he also gave us information as to what really happened at the forville secondary school whereby it was only 40 Learners that were impacted instead of 74 learners for now we will keep on tracking the story and see what happens we're going to talk to the parent and also talk to the sgb members to see what really happened and also what are they hoping to get from the Department to to to make uh means to decrease this kind of situation for

be Service delivery issues of course that Community being in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in the past watching developments for us is sabc news reporter offens stimo who joins us now live and often to see burning tires thick pumes of smoke behind you what's happening there residents of Westberry and coronationville have decided to brave this morning chil weather to take a stand for one of their basic human rights that is water According to some of the residents they are explaining that ever since covid-19 they've had erratic supply of water and now they decided that enough is enough and they're going to try and make their voices heard ja thank you so much for your time can you just tell us about the issue of water here in Westbury it's um coronationville and Westbury um sorry what's your name my name is ofense ofense thank you so much for coming out to us to visit us you know we've been going without water for years now since Co time but now this year it's been the worst this year we've been going out without water since March it is now October I think that's in excess of 8 months we will get water maybe 1:00 2:00 in the morning 4:00 the water's gone water is down our Gees burst we have to replace Gees schools schools our children will go to schools because they dismissed every day this week already yesterday there was no school because of the water situation sir can you just explain how is the situation in the household considering that you know the Twilight is not flashing you're not able to pass my brother this is first of all this is very unacceptable the way the people are living I'm actually a young I'm very I'm a youngster I'm I'm more concerned about the elderly people how young I me elderly people that's been here for years in this area people have to wake up early in the morning to I mean have to wake up early in the morning to have BS which is I mean that that's that's unhuman unacceptable that you have to go out to go buy water to keep your family happy which is also as people as pensioners here this is out of the budget so I think that uh they have to come out please and look at our needs also at how the people actually crying today uh the people came out and the numbers to support and we want our counselors to hear our voices and uh just take this way the step further please yes well thank you very much as you can hear that's the sentiment here they're saying that they are very thirsty and they are very dirty as some have not even bed properly for a couple of months just tell us when you speak to the municipality what do they say hi I'm Julie I'm at the old age village the we we for several times I've been Consulting the the counselors and the council City Council to come and see to our flights we as the elderly must get up 2:00 in the morning put on the alarm to get water in the morning just to have a bath how must we survive to go to the trucks and carry buckets up to our unacceptable our stairs my back is already in such a situation I have to stand there for all our people Westbury and coronation are being put down onto the thing government is doing nothing for our colored people we should our councelor must come to the table now she must lift her back up and come and see to us J J we don't know her face for 8 years she's been on this program 8 years and we haven't seen her face do you get water tankers how what how does the government intervene to give you water okay the water ters comes at 5:00 in the afternoon from 5:00 in the morning we must wait till 5:00 in the afternoon and then he goes to slowo park to park there they got water but we don't have water SL Park is water every day now must we walk to SL Park to go get a bucket of water to have a bus I'm very sorry government must do something come to our Aid now you left our colge people are too long too long you were saying T the T is our biggest problem because these tankers they belong to tenders so what they do is

the community and and closing the hydrant we are tired of this we've got counselors we've got leaders but we must fight our own battles no enough is enough we can't do this and we are race forers we we are next to the to slowo was getting water we are not getting water this is unfair and we are paying slow is not paying anything thank you very much well as you can hear people are quite angered by

main roads are actually closed and in fact the traffic came to a stand still for quite a while until it was actually diverted uh by The jmpd Who are actually keeping a close eye on the protest as they unfold here in the streets and we understand that you know recently rent water announced that there would be an issue of water shortage as according to a statement they released some of the municipalities uh had not complied with Arrangements that they had made to avade a situation where there is absolutely no water well as you can see here where we are at coronationville uh where the residents uh have actually blockaded the road they are saying that you know the situation is longstanding where they haven't had water for many years stemming from the time of covid-19 and you can

FmrGbrq19oI,Water Crisis | Jayant Bhagwan on SA's water usage,2024-10-16T08:28:31Z,520,let's continue to focus on the Water Crisis in South Africa the water research commission says the need for municipalities to develop Innovative programs that manage household and Industry water demand is a priority it says there is sufficient evidence that South Africans water usage is not sustainable in a water stressed environment the commission says water usage is way above the world Norms of around 170 liter cap per day with Kang alone averaging about 270 l cap per day rwater has recently issued a warning over an impending Water Crisis in Kang to discuss this matter further we're joined by executive manager for water use and waste management at the water research commission J Bagan Jay good to have you thanks very very much for joining us here on the program morning lean thank you very much so while water authorities report Kang residents use what about 237 lers of water per day um per person almost double the average of most cities this figure doesn't actually even account for why spread leaks throughout Johannesburg because we've heard how detrimental and how dire that situation is so I mean taking the number of liters individuals use add into that the amount that is lost through leaks how bad is the situation yeah it's it's it's quite bad and quite concerning uh but it's not as well abnormal I mean we're not the only uh place or s or country or city in the world facing uh a very unprecedented situation uh you know uh in in our kind of trajectory uh where we have not just a two-dimensional challenge to defeat of water scarcity but it's a cocktail of many many aspect PS around aging infrastructure poor oppression and maintenance uh poor investment in terms of uh uh uh uh you know upgrading the systems Etc uh on the face of fast urbanization Etc so it's a cocktail of issues that is kind of hitting us all at once okay yeah and yes the you know we can point fingers uh you know to the system uh around those aspects that have not been planned and dealt with but we also have you know this little or big elephant in the room around water usage Behavior yeah okay and it's it's come from a legacy it's come from an entitlement uh when water was plentiful and uh the issue of consumption uh wasn't a big factor and we have to accept water is cheap for many people you know that that that get it 24/7 so when you start seeing all of these issues that we are dealing with in terms of uh uh managing water in this complexity uh we also now need to empower our users our communities because we are part of the solution so and if collectively yeah sorry if collectively we don't work with the state to to manage this we will have crisis it's not one person's job is what you're saying we all need to work as a collective to try and and and sort the situation out but I mean South Africa is is growing in in urban centers I mean the resources which municipalities draw on to satisfy households and Industrial demand will will only become further stressed so when you say this is a collaboration what do we need to do uh we don't have too much time unfortunately less than 5 minutes left so I just want to ask as many questions as I can but perhaps you can get to that Crux of of how do we work together what do we need to do so Central to this is getting a bidirectional uh system of sharing information and data okay and uh municipalities and uh authorities are very very LAX in terms of keeping people aware of the consumption you know so uh you don't even look at your Municipal Bill to get get an understanding of how much water you've consumed people cannot relate to what is 270 L per capita so there are now Innovations and modern systems that uh bring this information uh through new techniques which we call behavioral nudges uh where we can uh influence people's salum and Norms by providing information and knowledge for example if I tell you that your neighbor used below 170 L per capita and you are using 270 your curiosity is kind of uh uh uh enlightened to say let me go and find out how he's achieving that because I should also try to achieve that yeah so so I think the power of this bir directional communication and youing using modern platforms that are available to us and data is what we need to kind of uh harness and create this Mass mobilization that people have this connection with water yeah that changes behavior and creates value yeah and you know it's just there's just so many issues associated with it and communities are getting more and more frustrated by the fact of water shortages and issues that are affecting their daily lives and we do know that every drop counts and people need to be conscious of of every single drop that they use but let's bring the large corporates into this the mining industry I mean as much as individuals may consume they also consume vast quantities of water yeah I agree but again you know you water is cheap you get a bill you budget for it you pay for it but you're not connected to the broad equation of of you know the environment we sit in where the cup is only so full okay and in Ken for specifically uh you know the cup cannot grow Beyond uh you know what it is now I mean the next uh uh quantity of water that you're going to bring uh is going to be very very far away very very expensive and possibly not practical so if we all get together collectively reduce our consumption I think we can work towards uh you know building water security for the next 50 to 100 years and maybe the next Generations would benefit and and we you know create this connection with the value of water especially in South Africa I mean I you know I think I think citizens are very much so um in in very much so aware of it I mean currently just so that we you know get get this on the record I mean we've got residents in Westbury that are currently striking right now they're out in the streets and we're getting some visuals in there in fact our reporter is on the way there to try and um ascertain exactly what's going on but Westbury residents taking to the streets for water this has become a very very major major issue and a big problem in the country so you know um let's look at Cape Town's model because it seems that Kang now is under a huge strain how did Cape Town go about reducing water consumption and actually managing water scarcity um can we use it as an example to to to move forward so a lot of the tools that we uh kind of innovated and use in Cape Town uh you know we need to pick up and start using them much broadly around the country because Cape Town demonstrated how we could connect people uh and change Behavior so the citizens of Cape Town Now understand the value of water understand you know that the changing uh climatic conditions brings uh you know kind of uh uh you know emergency situation so you now have a behavior pattern where you start planning for these aspects uh like I said in in C we're going to end up with many of these conflicts okay because suddenly people are not aware they expecting you know 24/7 water supply there's an interruption you're going into a conflict rather than saying that you know how would that information and knowledge prepare me uh you know to to to uh to to support and deal with these kind of incidents that happened and you know we we in a phase where we seen a lot of uh stoppages because of infrastructure uh being compromised due to aging due to uh vandalism due to many many factors so I think that's the new Norm that we have to start adapting to uh and also prepare ourselves to manage the risks yeah I mean you know I'm just reading experiences I mean about this this whole um uh coronation Ville and and people out and about in the in the streets you know this is one comment coming from estd who's saying people in coronationville are tired of the continuous water outages struggling with water for years and currently sitting with water outages from 6:00 a.m. to 1 p.m. for the last 2 weeks now you know and and this is this is the the story of so many people unfortunately and and as much as we need to do something about the the water and how much we consume there are a lot of issues as you've pointed out aging infrastructure the water leaks and all of these things do do you think there needs to be an amendment to the water services act I mean increase private sector Partnerships Without privatizing Water Resources but but also perhaps institutional reforms in order to address all of these challenges yeah look I I think our our legislation and our uh uh uh regulatory environment is quite establish it's just implementing that enforcing that uh and and and exec in that what that is weak okay and I think uh those aspects need to be fixed up I think uh you know the private you know getting more capacity uh from the private sector Etc uh is is also another way of trying to uh you know bring the competencies Etc to deal with the situation uh in that but also you know bringing greater investment and and enticing the private sector to and and creating the enabling environment to invest in this uh situation so that you know we can fix these problems much faster than uh you know what what we're dealing with at at the moment yeah uh because you know unlike electricity I mean we could light candles we could do Other Stuff Etc uh but when there's no water you constipated and and when you constipated everything explodes I mean you know so so this is what we're going to get to and yeah it affects sanitation it affects many things indeed it's the it's the health of the nation at dayare and and and we as a program will continue to very much so focus on this because this seems to be unfortunately our new issue we have electricity that has been a big problem but as you say this water issue it isn't something that you like to candle and take away this is a real problem and if we don't act now it it it almost feels like it's already too late but Jay close it up for me is it too late are we there's always a way that we can make this work and and we need to start acting right now yeah so you know in my article I talk about you know breaking below the 170 ler per capita yeah uh you know maybe we can start a campaign nationally around that and uh entice people you know to to change their behavior to achieve that okay uh you know and and make it kind of responsible fun uh but also you know tactical that we get to that point where uh you know we can sustain Water Supplies going into the future all right Jay thank you very very much for talking to us perhaps we can get our our morning live um X account to just put that out there your article and we can read a little bit more of how we can do this Jay baguan is the executive manager for water use and waste management at the water research commission talking about this need for water use behavioral change you and I need to change our behaviors and and fast unfortunately
aBUC2Tv4UFI,Spaza shops | Spotlight on lack of adherence to environmental health regulations,2024-10-16T08:07:58Z,5200,welcome back to nedi in Soto and this of course is the area in which an unspeakable tragedy played out where six young children lost their lives after allegedly consuming contaminated snacks that were bought from a local spaza shop so we've spoken to the police we've spoken to the authorities we did manage to get the provincial commissioner in touch with uh the father that we spoke to earlier and of course uh following up on that because one of the complaints has been that there hasn't been regular feedback to the families and of course uh the police commissioner also just explaining to the father that um the uh toxicology reports and such is the domain of the Department of Health but of course they will endeavor to try and get some answers to the families as soon as possible but we continue trying to just get to the bottom of what is going on uh you heard from the police commissioner as well uh the provincial commissioner about the arrests that were affected and we asked questions about this particular spaza shop behind me and its compliance and we are told that yes it did have a certificate of compliance and in fact everything was in order we also told that this shop was being rented from a young man who lives in the house next to it and uh he is of course taking care of this house that belonged to his grandparents and the owner of the spaza shop has been operating on these premises for about 12 years so in continuing to get uh some response and uh questions and answers that are coming through from the broader Community as well uh we are now joined by Mr yanas mangaba who is the nedi community leader just to find out from him in terms of the relationship Mr mangaba good morning uh between the operators of spaza shops in the area and the community how would you describe that relationship uh the relationship is not good man because these people have been selling spoiled uh Goods to our people it started two years ago the same year October month so we lost two kids the same as we have lost the six kids so we had several meetings with the community members here want because we wanted the respon since these things has happened so now the response was that these people must go and must be replaced with our own people because they are tired or one of these things that happen you so meaning that N is a dump area where they dump spoiled Foods yeah so we don't want to to see this anymore we are tired now after all this has happened we're going to sit down with the community all the community then we'll discuss about this thing about the way forward after the government has given us the report about those 66 kids yeah so in terms of the community sentiment as it stands right now you're saying the community is tired you no longer want um uh foreign owned businesses to operate in the area am I understanding you correctly and what does that mean because we saw the shops have been closed people have fled the area will they be allowed to come back I it is not wise for the the authority to allow them to come back the reason being again the second option is that our people net Works they don't work we used to have our own people operating SP shops in this areas so then they came after they came in they started to reduce the prices so now uh we started to suffer this conse of them of reducing the prices now our people are not buying from us anymore they buy from them so people people depend on these things I want to work so that's the most reason that they must leave okay Authority so after the authority will wait for their report of what had happened who is the perpetrator what step have they taken but now we as Community leaders we won't stand this in anymore it's for a second time because if we we don't deal with this now it will happen again because it seems this is a dumping area okay for those schools yeah so I think our relationship with these people is not good it's not good since we have this diseased six children Mr Yan mangaba n Community leader and you heard him say there they would prefer for foreign Nationals who own spasa shop not to return says the relationship between them and the local community is not a good one well I'm joined Now by Mr Amir she who's the chairperson of Africa diaspora Forum good morning and thanks for joining us a community leader Mr mangaba saying the relationship between foreign Nationals who run spaza shops in this area in n and the community are fraught uh it's not a good relationship what is your sense of it no thank you very much sister Sakina first of all may I send my condolence to the family of five and the young actually Kat oant who is now actually late also our sincere heartful condolence to the whole community of N and Soo but after that the relation need to be actually improved and there must be a means and way of improving it you can't come into a community and do business and the relationship is not actually right so it is upon actually the community and the community leader of Le of N and we respect any decision we will respect any decision that they take collectively and if they do not actually want we can't force them to be here and then the demand of the community must be respected so just in terms of the operator of this particular shop uh that is alleged to be the scene from where the children allegedly bought the contaminated snacks do you know any further details about the said person uh we have actually had to look for him we are told that the owner is actually Daniel a native of ethopia and he have been with this community for more than 13 years actually haven't married from here with a wife from actually the area who have given him a baby a daughter and actually a daughter from previous actually marriage he seems to have actually integrated with them for quite some well but his way about and now actually we cannot actually say as for actually what happened though actually we do not condone any Act of illegality but at least the owners still lies with the city of the Johannesburg you had and you have now interviewed the environmental health protection it is upon them they are underc capacitated only 33 actually officials inspectors in actually a city of Johannesburg that have got over 135 districts or actually world it's really actually hening but if they come on board and they were doing actually a constant almost everyday inspection this incident that happened few weeks ago and the incident of last year that have happened also on this same St could not have happened and this lives actually that we have lost of innocent young children could have been avoided so just in terms of and I hear you when you speak about the city having to do their work and their part but in terms of the business owners the entrepreneurs them and and and ensuring the safety of their customers who come to patronize their shops how do you respond to the community and just people in general saying that they are sold subpar stuff sometimes stuff that is expired you know um they they don't know they don't understand where it is that foreign National shop owners buy their stock from and where they get these things from what is your response to that uh sincerely speaking any item that is sold in these shops which falls under the category of the first moving consumable Goods first of all must be verifiable they must buy from a reput places and it must be actually easy for actually public scrutiny if these three are actually absent then it means that they can sell anything and they geising not only the lives of the local community but also that of themselves and it's something that at least the law enforcement that have been here the environment Health the community leaders my Elder need to actually do so that at least we make sure what we sell is to our consumers is something that is edible and we ourself can help it's unfortunate the the city of Johannesburg have got a hotline for dumping site if you dumped your West anywhere there is a hotline that the local community can call immediately and GMD official will be dispatched very unfortunate the community can see what is happening in the show but unfortunate there is no hotline that they can report immediately so there is priority given more by the city and the environmental health and the Johannesburg as a city to a dumbing site or actually a gabbage but when it comes to edible food it's unfortunate and really it's heartbreaking to see this because this is not the only incident Happening Here There was a report in sakan there was a report in quat there was a report also across in areas like M actually young and long in the western C so this issues is a national crisis and the government must deal with it but as the diaspora forum and I hear you you're absolutely right government has to deal with it but do you also not have a vested interest in ensuring that this sort of thing does not happen that it's not perpetrated by people in the diaspora here in South Africa because it tarnishes your reputation overall as well I think you had the environmental health prodaction in 2018 we translated the essential bws into vernacular so that the members will not say we were not educated we are not aware we are ignorant about this one thing that you cannot do and you know it is common sense need to apply here you can't have your detergent where you have your food that is unfortunate you can sell rat poisons or something that will actually deize or actually kill somebody so all this education aspect we assisted them we translated the essential bilos into vernacular but unfortunately the city is not coming on board to play its role so there you heard it and the diaspora Forum um through Mr Amir Shake saying they have done what they can they've translated the bylaws into the various vernacular languages for foreign they've spoken to some of these members but of course they say the government has to do their bit play their part and as we close this I'm just going to uh call msimango once again uh the father of the late seven-year-old injabulo who was one of the children who was uh one of the victims after consuming uh snacks allegedly bought from this particular shop so we've tried to get answers for you this morning uh msimango what's your response to what we did here today and of course the answers that you were able to get uh thank you very much once again uh look they will say what they want to say you know because of at times they in media but the major thing how long will it takes to get the feedback that's the question of you know I'll phrase out there how how long will it take us to get all the feedbacks you know from from uh from all the stakeholders and another thing i' would like to thank you know uh a certain political party I I don't know need even to mention it they were on board they really really really help us if it wasn't them look it was a disaster you know uh once again i' would like to thank the sapc of everything that they did hopefully we'll get answers out there thank you very much and that of course Mr tabom simango the father of the late and jabul simango one of the children one of the six children who passed on after consuming contaminated snacks we've tried to cast that net as widely as we can try to get some answers but of course it will remain a Blame Game and uh those children and their families deserve justice and we'll stay on the story until that actually happens so from n we have to leave it here for this morning for

TKSUR-sGa_8,Spaza shops | Calls for awareness about health regulations,2024-10-16T06:53:31Z,17172,"now officials from the consumer commission together with the Department of Home Affairs and the City of johannesburg's Environmental Health Inspectors started week-long inspections of spasa shops in Soto that's where we are broadcasting from and uh we obviously looking at what these inspections are doing they aim to ascertain compliance with the consumer protection act and other applicable laws and regulations and bylaws and of course you know that this is after the death of six children from alleged food poisoning after each snacks bought from a local spaza shop in nedi where Sina is Let's cross to her cuz I know that we're going to get an investigation or an update on all of that and much more that's happening Sakina let me hand it over to you and your guests well thank you lean and perhaps a good place uh to pick it up on the inspections as you rightly point out because those are the questions that the community is demanding answers to and of course we are focusing on naledi given the tragedy that unfolded six young children losing their lives we spoke to the father of a 7-year-old jabula msimango who lost his life uh giving us his sense of what has happened and I spoke to him off camera as well uh giving me a little more detail and talking about the disappointment that they feel as the families of being let down by the city of Johannesburg that made certain Promises to the families uh in terms of Psychosocial support and also financial support when it comes to the burial of their children which did not materialize Mr tabom simango told me about uh the support that was apparently going to be offered to the families and unfortunately when the city did not make good on that promise it almost led to a stampede at the funeral because so many people turned up and that support was not forthcoming and we did invite the MMC uh for uh social development and health here in the city of Johannesburg in makaula uh she unfortunately cannot be with us the city did however send us a representative uh to speak to us for this morning's broadcast and that is Mr Cory bonot who's the deputy director of environment Environmental Health in the city of Johannesburg Mr thanks so much for your time welcome to morning live good morning thank you please do be here so a lot of questions being asked just in terms of um basically how the city polies and make sure that struct such as these informal Trade Centers the spaza shops are actually policed you know what do you do because I heard um in preparation for this morning's broadcast I looked at some of the interviews that were conducted by the MMC for social development and health and she spoke about blitzes every Friday is that actually happening Yes actually it's happening since last year look last year the first round of these unfortunate events happened so since last year we have started with blitzers so up to June last year June this year our end of our financial year we have done just just over 6,000 blitzes at different places after that we we started again going back to a routine inspections and and the reason for that is that we had to focus on the rest of our work obviously um we've got nine Municipal Health functions to deal with so informal trait is only one of them so um we have also a gain started with regularly bles some areas this one for a example we were doing it once in a week with a multi disciplinary stakeholder group so you say you've started again when does that again uh relate to uh because this particular area now lady given what had happened last year with two children losing their lives uh when was the last time that inspectors actually came to this area before last week's incident so you must remember there's one environmental health practitioner olden days we used to call them Health Inspectors for an area so you've got a health inspector for this area environmental health practitioner and the last time that you've been in the affected place was in August so we a routine basis mean that if a place complies then obviously we do it less at that place if it doesn't comply then we do it more regularly so um uh eh environmental practitioner is then requested to do it on a um 34 basis or a quarter quarterly basis three times in a year but it is like that that if there's any other problems relating to this um then he will obviously do it more often I would imagine that this would have been um highlighted as a problem area given that children died here last year so we've seen again six children died this time around so when was the last time that the inspectors actually came here before this latest tragedy my report was that they have been here in August um as a routine inspection and and all the uh spaza shops around now were compliant I cannot say that because I have not been part of that inspection but the compliance um some today you're walk into a place it's 100% it's fine there's no problem tomorrow you walk in a place and something happened and and and it's not complained and then obviously we take our uh statutary action that we are supposed to take will you accept that you are understaffed and incapable of actually policing or making sure that you are able to enforce whatever laws and bylaws exist because you are underst staffed so let me explain that we've got 33 environmental health practitioners for the the entire suu area which serves um population of 1.5 1.6 1.7 million people um so yes we are under staff but I will not say we are incapable of doing our job because these guys are really working they are doing a lot of things um they focus on specific programs they do need to do sampling they need to do other complaints noise complaints they need to investigate um streams so there's so many things that they need to do um but I will not say they are incapable because we've got a good team yeah I'm not suggesting they are incapable I'm suggesting they may just be overwhelmed with the amount of work how many spasa shops are they in Soto the entire Soto area I'm not 100% sure because I was going to talk about my lady here we've got we had a meeting with the minister last night and he also asked the same question we've got about 88 in the N lady area for the entire city um of Johannesburg I'm talking we' have got just over 4,000 um inspector wise for the city we've got just over 200 environmental practitioners and then obviously they've got their managers and the the operations managers that is supposed to guide um and you know we've got about 6 million people living in in Johannesburg and if I talk about Johannesburg is from midrand up to orans farm on the one side from from the West r on the one side up to e on the other side just again how many spasa shops in Soto Soto as I I don't know because you say 88 here so I've read up and it says the estimates put it at between 10 and 15,000 spaza shops in Soo would you be inclined to agree with that um no not 100% because like I said um since last year we have developed a data base for the entire city so each region we've got seven regions have got their own database and the amount of in um spor shops then according to what I get is about 5,000 for the entire city so the figure that you are giving me for the entire s i I'm not I'm not convinced that that is the case so let's talk about the inspectors and what they do when they visit a spaza shop like this one what would be the uh steps that they have to go through and what would they have to tick off on so when they a normal inspection will basically be you get into a price you identify yourself obviously you go through the premises so you look at um hygiene is the place clean um do they have the necessary facilities to what what they are doing you look at the the structure itself you look at the walls you look at the roof um then you ask a few questions are they doing pce control what type of pce control are they doing um they also do sampling when when we have a sampling run um and we test for chemical and bacteriological samples how often is that done we've got a a program for the city of Janes BG so each region and I've explained there seven regions um we've got a program and each region is doing um samples on a regular basis like in a according to our program what is a regular basis how often do you do that so you must also understand what I'm saying um a regular basis for me I've got a program has been done once in a week in specific areas in Johannesburg so so is one of those that that is doing that but also understand that each and every sper shop is not being sampled each and every shop is not being sampled so you you take a specific shop you do your sampling there today and you submit it to the lab so chemical samples going to Petoria there we test for um colorin you taste for preservatives you those are the things that you are testing for um it takes some time because all chemical samples take time we also do the in bacteriological samples if they are preparing food the SP shop is not supposed to to prepare food they are um supposed to sell prepacked Foods um and those type of groceries so but you we also take some of those samples viologic samples is taken at places where they prepare food basically so you take the hot food you submit it to the lab in Johannesburg about 2 or 3 days later you get the results what about snacks and uh stuff that children buy and consume so the snacks that is the ones we doing chemical samples on um the law prescribes what samples we are supposed to take and we do that um on our roster program okay so if it's done on your roster program Mr Pono that means you are able to give me information um I don't necessarily require what was done last week but up until that time you would be able to give me that information okay I cannot give results of all the samples that we have taken obviously and also don't know out of it out of my head but I can provide that to you at the later stage but I must say that most of the samples that we take complies to the FCD act food cosmetics and disinfectant act but some of them do not comply and then we we obviously take action against it so what are the repercussions of that if it's not compliant do you close the shop what do you do and we must also understand that it's not always the shop as such remember these things are manufactured somewhere um so you would rather go back to the manufacturer to say your um food stuff doesn't comply you give them a time to cor Rectify and you go and do a resample to see that it's done in spa shops however and and informal trade you get these big bags which they buy and they repack it which should actually not happen um those ones is a bit more difficult because you get into the shop you ask the uh people you know where did you buy it why are you repacking it and sometimes the answer is just you know we buying it at mro so or I'm saying M but but when that happens what what what are the repercussions what should happen look one one go back to the factory manufacturer and you say to them this is what is wrong fix your product if they don't fix it there's legislation you can actually prosecute people for that have you prosecuted anybody we have not prosecuted um recently for those type of things because what I always say to people when I see results coming from the lab and doesn't comply please go back let's get it right rather and get the product compliant that's going out on the market just a quick one before I move on the city promised psychosocial and financial support to the families uh why did that not materialize okay for me that is not the question I can answer because I'm here for the environmental half part of this but um I suppose if they have made a promise I will discuss it with the MC MMC when I go back into the office um it might still become for it I hope so well I hope so but thank you so much Mr Pon not of course there's a lot that still needs to be answered to and as you say you can Avail those uh test results to us so I would like to take you up on that offer so that we can have a look in terms of just the tests that are conducted have been conducted and what the results showed but thank you so much and that was um Mr Corey B Ando deputy director of Environmental Health in the city of Johannesburg let me step over and I'm joined Now by Lieutenant General Tommy Tomi who is the provincial commissioner for police here in king um thank you so much for your time sir and thanks for joining us a lot of community safety we see you know the hting crime wardens we also see many police members here uh this is not usual the residents around here tell me they never see these people around here good morning uh to you and uh greetings to viers at home um uh yes of course uh your remarks uh might be uh something which one can indicate uh but uh we normally uh have these integrated operations as I always say um when we have to work more especially in the instances like this one we have to make sure that um we put together the whole government approach and uh that process is the process which was approved by cabinet in 2022 and of course we know for the fact this area n lady that um recently we had uh children who have been affected it was uh five those who passed on and um on Saturday during the burial and then we received a message from the hospital that one has passed on we are of course uh last year had also children those who were affected it was five of them of which three ped all we're investigating uh three case dockets of inquest one can uh just indicate that um we are of course uh following the process in terms of forensic uh uh pathologist reports of which uh last year the three inquest docket we have since received one postm which confirms that the cause of the death is uh carate which is um baits uh used to kill uh insects for the other two cases we are still uh awaiting uh these U uh forensic reports and uh of course uh is the two issues the postm report is the toxicology report which we are still waiting for so I must just indicate that the minister of Health yesterday called an urgent meeting in ensuring that uh the whole government approach has to be followed systematically of which the South African Police Service was there uh the department of um health of course and also environmental Department of Agriculture forestry uh fisheries and Forestry was uh also there so that we can U uh drum and put it together I must just indicate that um even last year we had some operational activities uh within uh this area but you know as you were speaking to Mr President or the deputy director that uh some of the aspects is the aspects which we have to deal with u uh the Department of Environmental Health but uh we can indicate or confirm of late that Friday we had a operation within this area where we arrested 12 people for illegal immigrants notices were issued by environmental health and the 14th we also we were also on the ground of which arrested three six notices were issued yesterday uh nine notices were issued by uh environmental health so we'll keep on uh dealing with this issue we also link this issue with u the provincial joints intelligence structure which I chair of which uh government departments are within that space uh commissioner Beni the scene behind us this particular spaza shop we understand that the person operating the shop has been doing so for 12 years years we understand he is an Ethiopian National who's been renting the space what more do you know about him and do you know whether he's actually compliant with the laws of the country in terms of the setup of the shop and of course his own uh papers and permits to be in the country well in terms of uh the papers one uh could confirm that we could not uh find anything you know wrong though he was operating as I indicated that you have to take not that U uh the aspects of issuing the notice it's um the work we do with our colleagues from Department of Environmental uh health of which they systematically uh followed the law as you interviewed him and he indicated that instead in terms of the statutory law they issue those notices and uh they follow through the notices and uh ultimately where the action has to be taken it has to be taken so but just to bottom line this particular spasa shop the owner of this shop is here in the country legally and this particular shop has been operating legally is that what you're saying uh well the issue of uh the spa shop is operating illegally so is uh something which Department of Environmental Health can uh confirm that but I can confirm that U uh when we come here we came with the Department of Environmental Health if they issued the notice because you'll have to understand how uh this process the process flow in terms of following that you issue a notice to say you are not complying and then you have to follow those notices and there are specific dates which you have to issue those notices and of which Department of Environmental Health they have uh they have done so so uh that process flow is followed for all uh the shops or all the spaza shops uh of which uh the department do uh make a follow up and we are working together with them in terms of the whole government approach well that is the Provincial Police Commissioner giving us uh his sense in terms of what's being done in the multisectoral approach uh in reaction to what happened here in N but of course we continue this conversation and we will of course be joined by community members other stakeholders as we continue to ask the questions and also on behalf of the families try to find out why promises that have been made have not been met"

poisoning after allegedly eating food items bought from their local spaza shop with investigations and inspections continuing on what could have caused the debts this tragic incident has yet again brought to light concerns regarding non-compliance with regulations by some informal business Traders including spaza shop owners this morning we take a closer look at what has happened to spaza shops which are the back bone for many South African communities Let's cross to Sakina she is in nedi nedi what nedi Sakina what have you got for us this morning and a very good morning to you well good morning Leanne and uh thank you for that introduction because I think it certainly captures the reason for us being here this morning and as you said we are in N which is of course where six young children lost their lives after allegedly consuming contaminated um food items snacks for that were allegedly bought from a Tac shop so uh just to give you a sense of where we are and uh this is the street on which the TAC shop the alleged Tac shop from where the children bought these snacks allegedly is located and we are standing right in front of it but perhaps just to start off with a little bit of history as far as T shops are concerned in southa Africa so this is as we refer to them as spaza shops you know something that's informal something that's hidden and something that uh started with communities who were during their apartate era um basically removed from the retail uh Outlets that existed mainly in white areas and then of course people were Innovative they made sure that they brought some of those facilities and um access to buying certain products closer to their communities and hence the start of the spaza shops that were hidden but because they were hidden of course they were informal and they were not registered and that is something that we will touch on again later because by and large now that we have now come into a new era a new dispensation of democracy many of these uh instances in many instances these shops still remain unlicensed and we'll talk to the Imp ations of that but of course we understand that there may be between 10,000 and 15,000 spaza shops in Soto alone and across South Africa between 100 and 150,000 spaza shops and initially this was obviously operated as family businesses where people would convert their garages where they would uh convert a room maybe in their home to sell stuff to the community so very Community orientated But as time went on especially in the early 2000s we saw an influx and of course a takeover by Foreign Nationals in many of these shops and in the main these would be somalis Ethiopians pakistanis and bangladeshis who would run uh these uh T shops or spaza shops and of course what a subsequently happened is that they were able to pull their resources together we are told and and as such be able to actually competitively uh price their products that they would sell to the community but very intricate and we'll talk more about that as the morning progresses but right now behind me is of course the tuac shop where it is alleged that the children who passed away bought the snacks that were contaminated from but I am joined here by Mr tabom simango and Mr tabom simango is the father of the late jabul Sango who was 7 years old one of the children who unfortunately lost his lives mronga I must say first off sincere condolences on your loss um unfortunately as a parent I know your pain of losing a child so how are you coping how's the family coping look uh I'd like to greet everyone the family won't be able to cope you know losing a child that never got sick it's it's it's it's it's it's something else and the family is still you know devastated you know of of of everything and uh going to miss him miss him you know his shoes who's going to wear them the cup that he was using who's going to use it look I'm going to miss him you know in in in in in almost everywhere everywhere that you can think as a parent yeah and of course um we know that the investigations are ongoing but I want to know from your your perspective as a parent how did this news break to you you know how did you become aware of the unfolding tragedy as it played out on that day look uh the investigation as as as as as far as I know it's it's still ongoing and we're still waiting uh for the for the actual you know uh news from from from from the police you know what exactly you know it's it's it's it's it's it's been transpired basically we are still waiting so has there been any indication from the authorities as to how long it will take before you know conclusively what was the cause of death have you had any postmortem results or anything else that has been shared with you look we are we are we are still waiting you know the postmortem uh the results it's it's still pending you know how long will will it takes for the results you know to to to reach to to us as a family we really don't know but we are still waiting and of course um it is said the allegation is that the children consumed snacks that were contaminated from your perspective as a parent who was at the center of this because your child was involved was one of the children unfortunately who consumed and uh subsequently passed on do you know exactly what happened um how this particular T shop came to be implicated look uh I wouldn't have you know answers per se you know uh because you know as a parent you want to make sure that your child doesn't you know uh get something of which you know that it's going to be it's not going to be you know in use towards him you know by him as a speculations like buying whatever that that was been bought you know look to to start with the mother didn't want to give him you know even a scent to go and buy whatever because of you know the speculations that foreign Nationals they are buying something of which they're not in in in good condition you know so and unfortunately you know the worst has come to pass and and and we've seen that some of the spaza shops around the area have subsequently been closed down your thoughts on that because right across from here there's another spaza shop that is operational um we told this one is run by one of the locals here in N but your thoughts on the T shops and these paa shops and just their operation in general you know honestly closing of paa shops it's not a solution it's not a solution per se look everyone can buy uh Goods in one in one in in one place but we the sauce where the sauce these thing are being manufactured that's where everything everything you know it must start because closing of pzzle shops it does it's not a solution it's not only n lady that has you know spor shops as a whole they have spor shops meaning uh the the investigation it's not it mustn't only be done only in in in a it must been done the entire country so that kids out there must be safe mango I'm going to park this conversation there with you for now of course we will have more stakeholders coming through and hopefully try to weigh through this conversation and talk to what it is that you expect as a victim um to come out of all of this but thank you so much uh for sharing with us thanks for your bravery for speaking to us and once more condolences to you and your family thank you thank you very much right I'm just going to move over to my right and I'm joined here by uh Pisa kulle who's the deputy president of the Soto business Forum Miss Kul thanks for your time as well so given the tragedy that has unfolded here let me get your sentiments on that first and foremost oh okay thank you so much uh first of all as the businesses and so to we are just saying enough is enough we cannot uh be always uh grieving or passing out the rest in peace especially to our young ones on something that uh there is a law in our country that really governs how you run the business especially uh the business that has food inside um compliancy uh it has been the talk of everyone everyone is saying uh none of these sper shops have compliancy and now the question who is responsible to make sure that compliancy is there and the responsibility is everyone including us as the community as well um it looks like we like entertaining the issue of of fake Goods that are seen or found in these foreign national uh T shops and we post them on Tik Tok and on Facebook and there is after that it's just a joke and nothing else it's been 10 years more than 10 years we've been fighting the issue that these people they are selling things that have expired just only that I believe that it's supposed to be a crime because you cannot sell food that is expired to the community and nothing has ever we have never had any kind of any arrest on all this uh tragedies that are happening last year we lost children in the same space here and when the the results they came the P they said that um uh it was not on from the biscuits and now we are saying there's alleged that they ate snakes that had h been poisoned and now the answers they are saying that on the bodies of the kids they have found a red poison so now the question is that who will take the blame because somebody here has done a crime and that crime has caused the lives of our six little children of which now it's really not safe not only for kids but for everyone in the community so we have tried our best we have fought so much in terms of let us sit down with all the organizations as they are Bangladesh H H Somalians they have a a full structure of Executives that come let us sit down let us talk how where are you buying your goods why is that your goods are different from the others why is that there are so many rumors because we can't say because we don't have facts why there are so rumors that you are selling things that have expired you are selling things that are faked and then what are these things doing to our community because it's not only about children I can understand for children that their immune system might be weak but what is happening to us what is going to happen in 5 years to come on this food that is being uh consumed from these T shops so it has been such a a very bad experience and with our own government the only time they will stand up is when there is death so the question then is you say you've been fighting this fight for more than 10 years how have you been fighting it because it seems very reactionary you you you just mentioned the incident of children who died last year and things just after a while went back to normal here we are again six children have now lost their lives so when you say you've been fighting how have you been fighting and what have been the outcome of that our fight was that we were looking for the source where is the source of the of the goods that is being supplied in the township and we were then told that they buy in bulk where we all buy there and they said that they've got a buying power and then we then asked our own government it was still a premier makura then he then agreed that in soet he will bring a warehouse where all the spers especially South African owned they can make sure that they get the right Goods that they can supply to the community and because of the unstability of our government the time he left and there was another Premier coming in that project had now just faded away because until we fix the issue that why is that all the people that are supplying H Food even drinks they are out of so none of them is inside of so we don't have a warehouse in so to where we can say this is the this is where we find our food and this is where all the regulations in terms of health inspection it is properly done because at the end of the day yes you are make you are into business but at the end of the day you must also take care of the people that you are selling to you cannot sell to people that they must die then who's going to be your customer well many questions and of course we hoping to get answers um some of the questions that Miss Kul speaks about we will have government authorities who will come through to answer some of those questions we will will have representatives of some of the uh foreign owned spaza Shops coming through as well to talk about their practices the question that Miss Kul asked where do they buy their bulk supplies from because apparently everybody buys from the same place but maybe not so all of those questions still remain to be answered"

BnI_UWyRpPs,Access to funding I Young entrepreneurs face barriers - Sabelo Mbuku weighs in,2024-10-15T22:13:23Z,535,the second quarter labor force survey from stat sa puts Northwest at the top when it comes to unemployment several young people in murang say they started their own businesses to avoid unemployment but they say funding remains a huge stumbling block the business that I'm running is about snake packs since Val I saw that there is a a crisis whereby children are dying due to fake snakes that are produced at uh illegal by our foreign Nationals so yes I need a funding for this business I'm struggling to find a place to sell this food of mine I also uh I struggle also on the events whereby they sometimes call me at some popular events and I cannot go there because I don't have infrastructure to go and buy and sell there I don't have proper equipment to go and sell there my challenge more more the jewel side Jewel equipment is very expensive so I would like to please beg for funding so that I can be able to buy my tools for my studio my backyard Studio the traditional leadership in the area says he doesn't wish to see its people being drug addict engaging in Social ills and relying on social grants if you see the statistics they will tell you that this is a sector that ensures that more shops are created and we want to see young people exit exiting in their households and their families exiting this system of social grants so that they can be independent they can be able to improve their quality of life they can be able to contribute to revenue collection by SARS and we can then see more investment by government into infrastructure development thereby creating an opportunity for investors to come in and ensure that more jobs and more opportunities are created then you know engage these young people around these sectors the opportunities that come for them from jobs internships mentorships entrepreneurial um development as well as you know training opportunities so Empower youth is really speaking to the marginalized areas Township areas that have no attention that are inundated with young people that don't have access to opportunity and what we do is we bring this platform to them exactly where they are to make sure that industry then engages them um around the respective indust economies that make up um you know the economy of the of the province potential funders say opportunities are there but prospective business owners must get proper training if you've got a business idea it doesn't matter how unsure you think about it come for our training we will work with you with that idea because a week after you get trained we we call you back for what we call pitching and where you use whatever we had taught you in order to be able to Showcase your business and sell your business now those pitching skills they are not just for the nyda they are for any other potential investor who you are going to meet in order for you to be able within a 3 minute space that you are given when someone you've captured their attention within that 3 minutes you need to be able to sell your business so a lot of um challenges that um and entrepreneurs especially the youth is that they don't bring in the work you know um it's important to show funders that You' put in the work you know your business through and through I want to talk especially about the market the market um be practical about it go out and speak to people find out if they would actually buy your product according to States sa the 2024 second quarter labor force survey shows that 8.4 million people of the working age of between 15 to 64 years are unemployed while 3.2 million others are discouraged or have stopped looking for workc news let's speak to transport education training Authority spokesperson sabelo muku who joins us and weighs in on this conversation sael very good evening to you welcome to to the show we listened to the cries of young people entrepreneurs speaking about their many challenges when it comes to scaling in in their businesses they spoke one gentleman spoke about uh uh access to Market being one of them infrastructure equipment and really funding being at the center of it all what is your um feedback on this yeah thank you so much um I think what is critical PO with looking at all of these opportunities that are presented to young people um is that state of Readiness for individuals will become key because of the number of young people that will be looking to unlock each opportunity so if you are not ready at the specific time that the opportunities present handed to you then you get to Forfeit the opportunity and then you will be um that one who says well there's no funding or opportunities do not exist so as TAA which is one of the 21 cers in the country we we are mandated then to facilitate skills development and training um especially in the transport sector however we look at the vehicles like the Empower youth um as programs that are geared toward assisting young people to unlock opportunities now with that we are able to then say um while we are you know looking at the unemployment rate how do you as a young person Empower yourself skill yourself and get ready then to enter into the space of business and as the CER what we have done um in the past few months is to train young people um to be motorbike drivers that is for them to get motorbike licenses and then with that um then there is a program called new Venture creation which then equips them with business skills where they will be certificated to actually run a business then what we add on top of that is then access to Market looking at the e-commerce space where we can then um connect these young people to the the businesses that are operating within the Ecommerce space so that they can start then operating but what is critical PO is that you can do all that you can but if the state of Readiness whether of the mind or just access to information that prepares young people for this opportunity is not there then whatever that we do will still remain in vain as you make mention of the some of those really crucial points I mean you speak about um access to markets and to run a business but what opportunities lie in the sector uh basically what what we are doing is to look at opportunities that are tangible um like I was mentioning just now is that when you look at the e-commerce Market is quite growing where young people are able then to um you know do the deliveries whether of goods from the e-commerce entities or companies so with that um you take a young person who's unemployed you train them um you know and then they obtain a license they are trained in business then they are able to actually start their own businesses and be able to function so what is critical for us is that as young people then get equipped with all of these skills then the owners is on them again to then look for other opportunities to diversify their business model so that they are able to extend their streams of income you um industry engagement is seen as something highly crucial in fact a tool when it comes to understanding the various sectors that uh entrepreneurs may be trying to venture into and of course being ready and not missing the opportunity what have you found to be some of the um ways in which young people can be ready but may perhaps just need a little bit of guidance that uh could put them essentially in line to to access the opportunity um I think the the fact that um young people have most of them yeah have this sense of ENT entitlement um that things should come to them and I think for many it then delays their progress and those who then go after opport opportunities then they tend to access them quicker so what we have seen um over the past few months when we're supporting the Empower youth programs is that you would find that young people would come um at an opportunity where they have to pit for instance their business model and realize that they they are not ready all the business is not registered the business still exists in their heads it has not yet uh started to operate it's not it's not um structured such that anybody could have an interest in funding it now imagine when you have funders in the room that are waiting for you then to pit the business but you are not ready so those are the things that we have picked up and we believe that when we support Empower youth it then gives them opportunity because there are mentorship programs that they would then uh be enrolled in so that they are supported to register their businesses they are supported in how to run their businesses how to even Define their markets or the target audience that they want to serve so all of those things because not everybody would get an opportunity to access a business but if you can get the knowhow how to keep your business sustainable and how to access opportunities if we invest in that then more young people will be able to access opportunities in the future yeah abely absolutely thank you so much for speaking to us this evening uh wrapping up that conversation with transport education training Authority spokesperson sabelo moku

headed by infrastructure South Africa an entity of the Department of Public Works and infrastructure president s Raposa earlier this year announced 12 infrastructure initiatives with 179 billion Rand in Project preparation funding in the first year allocated by national treasury to infrastructure South Africa to support catalytic projects the minister says the bids will build on this the bid window we are announcing today is open to submissions from National and provincial government departments state-owned entities municipalities and private sector players with public sector support it will allow us to turbocharge infrastructure investment by ensuring that projects are not only well prepared but also attract the necessary funding to get off the ground the focus is on large scale projects those that are valued at 1 billion Rand and above infrastructure South Africa is 3 years in and has encouraged biders to support proposals with a window expected to close on the 6th of December selected projects will benefit from comprehensive project preparation assistance including funding financial structuring support with the process and guidelines outlined on the entity's website projects that are going to be considered for onboarding by infrastructure South Africa are projects that will inject private sector financing and and private sector support so ppps like you've said you know by their nature of course because they are called public private Partnerships they do um inject private sector participation Blended Finance candidate projects these are projects that in the main require some level of fiscal allocation to drisk this projects but the rest of the uh funding uh requirements for those projects get to be leveraged and crowded um in from private sector uh uh players the country has seen underinvestment in infrastructure ructure with efforts like operation Vin set up to open up opportunities they still concerns about the prevalence of the construction Mafia phenomena which has disrupted projects if we are going to create that certainty and sustainability in infrastructure projects and financing we need to be able to give the private sector guarantees that their investment is safe that their projects will be delivered on time and on budget there are of course a number of very difficult conversations and issues that we need to deal with particularly around uh what some might call the seter side rule the 30% uh that has been hijacked and captured by the construction Mafia and there's no uh small or medium uh Enterprise development or work being done and so they are really really losing out so we need to address that and on the 19th of November we'll be holding a National Construction Summit in eweni where we're all going to come around the table we're going to have mecs from around The Province we have the National Police Commissioner National Police Minister other role players in the construction industry and we are going to come up with a common plan a common agreement and then most importantly a program of action on how to implement that so that we are able to protect investment the infrastructure bid window process is set to form part of the policy and Regulatory changes in a bid to rapidly tend South Africa into construction site for economic growth and large scale job creation the officials are hopeful that bid window one will help turbocharge infrastructure investment in South Africa with the emphasis being on the 6th of December deadline the minister is also hopeful that the construction Summit next month will address concerns of the mafas with a successful biders expected to be announced at next year's sustainable infrastructure development Symposium Sac news in senton right let's expand the conversation Chris Campbell who's the CEO of consult engineer South Africa cesa joins us now a very good evening to you thank you so much for your time Chris we heard the minister speaking about how this move represents an important moment and an evolution in the work of infrastructure South Africa what does it mean for your membership base which I know is made up of companies offering an entire range of Consulting Engineering Services Services yeah um and good evening a PO and good evening to your viewers certainly this is very welcome news um and and um there's a lot of excitement in the industry um I have to admit that this is not the first time that um this process as uh has had some pronouncements um in its infancy when infrastructure South Africa was at first established that was always the uh premise um upon which it had been uh established and I'm happy to say that even back then we as an industry Consulting engineer South Africa had um been offering advice to the then head um of uh the well through the head and and through the the other people coordinating the various streams in that program it is made up various streams in in this instance of course um I think it it's critical that we get to a point where we uh as the minister has indicated stop talking and start doing um you know so I think that's that's um really what we see as has a a Need for Speed you you speak about um how you had over the past issued and given some advice do you see that any of your advice had been has been implemented or or considered with this decision and a deadline being set look let me just say that the deadline aspect is new it has always been a concern where um there have been many calls for private sect investment and the unfortunate reality is that and and I I I I guess with the new hope that we have in our government of national Unity that will get traction this time around um there is a greater appetite to get the show on the road uh previously one sort of found that we we we got got stuck on policy issues and and thankfully operation vula was then established to to unblock some of the policy issues that might have have been uh you know holding up this process right now uh too I I think there's a lot more uh positivity Vester confidence and you are likely to get more traction but I think it is crucial as you rightfully says it's not it must not be seen to be some kind of a wish list I think many of our public sey institutions have tended to um if I can use the analogy of do some kind of cigarette box analysis and then they've got their um uh idps that they develop but the substance to inform that was hardly you know hardly of any substance and then you put in applications for Grant to National treasury you get the money and nothing happens so in this case and I'm I'm almost sure that the infrastructure process will still require that those entities bidding don't just submit some kind of wish list there has to be some kind of substance business case why do you need the money what's going to capitalize and and and how how is that going to have a a broader knock on effect because in most in most instances the idea here is to be able to get to a point a where you can put in place bulk Services water uh uh waste water uh electricity Supply roads that make it feasible then for some developer to make a Mega investment in the in a large uh mixed use development scheme which includes housing and and and the rest in fact as you asked those questions we we heard that the focus will be uh around projects that will contribute significantly to the GDP uh in terms of growth job creation supporting South Africa's Global competitiveness localization and all sorts and that the that they transfer fiscal risk away from the public sector to to from the public sector of course and of course that in itself speaks to some of the questions and the criteria that has been set out and um how you you're saying that you you want it to be implemented in a way that will will resonate with with with moving forward and we also did hear that private sector projects do not qualify for the support I mean how how is that rationed so I think the premise on which primate uh private sector projects should um qualify is obviously there has to be a substantiated business case that makes sense uh there should be enough um front end engineering and and then a lot of the project preparation that they would have done to to substantiate why the additional support is required uh uh that is required is then made available it's not a case of just uh uh like playing the lotto and you hope you get lucky because first of all I mean these funds are are you know they government availing them they are from investors and and you can't just you know throw money at at an issue or problem and hope that it's going to change um a whole lot yeah and and I think it's important that we also understand that the the the the purpose and and we going to let's look at two types of infrastructure we talking here about how can you develop economic infrastructure which can catalyze economic growth uh roadways roads rail if we you know get the rail running if we can get our uh fiber roll out many of those are are crucial so that we can boost tourism we can boost uh um trade you all of the above and in parallel with that then the investment that that then gets derived from that makes it adds to our GDP and will make our social infrastructure more affordable and and perhaps very lastly uh as I cut you short I do apologize for that the issue of the construction Mafia is one that came up and we know the challenges around it and the uncertainty it creates in government's ability to develop or even de deliver projects on time what are your thoughts around that well I think truth be told it's high time we nip this in the bud because you know unless we do that it is going to be a stumbling block and and I I I believe that communities benefit from these projects should be brought on board be become part of the solution and and and you know collaboratively with law enforcement let's look at how can you root out people who have actually no interest in the benefits to the communities or economic growth of this country and unfortunately there's uh and and and I believe Minister um punu is doing a lot uh to try and address this issue in support of the aspirations expressed by uh Minister mcferson and and what is required yeah is government to work in concert with each other not in silos uh and and Because unless we can can do that we we may have an aspiration on the one end and then we have a stumbling block on the other end yeah that's uh you know creating a blockage for Progress very well thank you so much for weighing in on the discussion Chris Campbell CEO of Consulting Engineers South Africa cesa joining us they're getting some reaction on what has been presented when it comes to important moves in the

kTlzVE0mOoM,R20 million in Two-Pot municipal claims - Mathawe Matsapola weighs in,2024-10-15T20:42:08Z,619,"now aani retirement fund administrators has processed twoot withdrawal claims for the municipal employees pension fund since the 16th of September after a thorough reconciliation and updating of August contributions for each member the fund has paid out 20 million Rand in the two part claims within two weeks aani retirement fund administrators marketing manager matwe ma mapula joins us for a conversation expanding on that a very good evening to you thank you so much for your time we we've heard instances of uh government workers having to wait for for up to two months to receive their their payments how have you managed to ensure that you are able to have paid out so many people well I'm I'm assuming it's it's it's many based on on the figure uh good evening PA and thank you so much for the opportunity uh th thus far we've actually now uh updated and have paid over 58 million Rand by today so the 20 million was within uh the two weeks from the 16th until the 27th of September but by now we are sitting on 58 million Rand anding this because daily uh claims are being processed and daily as well we we are continuing to receive uh claims uh from uh from the members it's actually High volumes but we working around the clock to ensure that uh we make payments daily so that we can cover each and every person or every member who was slimed uh for for the two ports with that 58 million Rand are you able to then quantify how many members have been paid out you've paid over 2,000 uh members with the 58 uh million uh rent and we still have uh as I'm saying that daily we keep receiving more and more claims though they so the number of claims keeps growing but we've paid over 2,000 uh members now we looking at 200 uh 2 uh 50 members that have been paid thus far your ability to process and pay withdrawals how how what what Encounters in terms of challenges have you been met with more so as we learn of the validity process being highly crucial before a payment is made yes so we actually go through quite a process as well just to ensure that uh mat is the correct person claiming that particular amount because we talking about people's hardend cash here so we don't want to make a mistake of paying M instead of mat therefore we do all all the verifications that needs to be done to ensure that this is the correct person and from there we also ensure that this person qualifies for the amount that they have applied for and there is also the process of actually uh submitting uh to SS so that uh they can take their potion prior to a member getting paid so before a member get uh paid out there is the whole background that must be done and if there are perhaps let's say a member owes SS and we get a directive that this member owes exactly the amount that they want to to to withraw we do inform the member that kindly note that uh you this much is going to be paid over to S uh we do communicate all those uh type of information so that the member is also informed on exactly what is uh happening what were some of the other disappointments that members may have been met with members who may be watching and saying I'm definitely not part of the 2,000 who has uh received this money uh as I'm saying we've got uh High volumes of claims that we receive uh daily and what's happening is that when H mat has received and has not received as yet uh obviously out of excitement I will share my good news that I've received uh my claim so what we are encountering is members uh calling in to find out how far their application process is and if they're ever going to be paid and and but we managing that daily to ensure that members know exactly where their application is when they call in and even sending out communication uh with the processes if we currently processing your claim and SMS you will receive an SMS that your your claim uh it's currently being processed it should take uh days and you will get paid so members are anxious to say I've applied why have I not received my money as yet but due to the background processes that have we've got to go through prior to making payments uh members are answered that why am I not paid as yet which is why we are appealing to members for the patients to say you will receive your money you will be paid no member will not be paid for as long as they've got the funds uh in the in their savings Port we will definitely be paying all the members that have claimed mat of course we cannot Overlook that these are funds initially designed for retirement what sort of considerations should people be making before they are contacting you or or perhaps looking to to make these withdrawals you know as much as uh government emphasized that that the savings Port serves so that members can uh tap into it in case of emergencies and there is no other way they can get the fund we also are doing the same thing uh as uh the administrator of the Municipal Employees Pension funds to say don't tap into your savings sport if you don't have a real emergency but again we also appreciate the fact that my emergency is not necessarily the next person's emergency but we emphasizing that please please don't just go into the savings sport because you want to throw h a lavish birthday party because that's not an emergency the retirement or the pension fund money is so that when you retire you can retire comfortably and still be able to sort of uh take care or or or live the same lifestyle you were living when you were working so therefore for you to make that decision to tap into your savings account make sure that it's a real emergency and you don't have any other way out but the way out is to tap into your retirement money but if you have a way out why tap into the money that is going to assist you very well thank you so much for for speaking to us this evening as we wrap up that conversation aani retirement fund administration's marketing manager mat matapa joining us for that discussion expanding on the number of claims that have been processed 2,000 uh claims of course uh in terms of membership but 58 million Rand paid out to date"

JVOxmS1UuXs,President Ramaphosa refers two Bills to ConCourt - Faatima Laher weighs in,2024-10-15T20:31:57Z,3885,"president sir Raposa has referred the copyright Amendment Bill and performance protection Amendment Bill to the Constitutional court for a constitutionality ruling the president requested Parliament to reconsider these bills section 27 representing blind essay filed an urgent application against Raposa for failing to S the cop sign the copyright Amendment bill which was challenged for infringing on the rights of Blind and Visually Impaired persons two years ago now those courts ruled in favor of blind essay and ordered Parliament to amend the act by September 21st section 27 candidate attorney Fatima leer joins us for more a very good evening to you Fatima thank you for your time after parliament's reconsideration of the Bulls the president is still hobing some concerns and has now requested a decision from the Constitutional Court you've filed an urgent application what does it contain good evening all to you and your listeners uh thank you so much for having me um so what our applic deals with is that we filed a mandatory order to the Constitutional Court uh which was twofold um we are section 27 representing blind saay and we have requested the president to sign the copyright Amendment bill um further and alternatively we've requested that um if the president uh does not sign the bill we request that the Constitutional Court uh then in the clause 13d which was a clause that they decided upon in our previous constitutional Court application and what this this Clause does is it amends the legislation to the extent that it discriminates against people who are blind or visually impaired and further brings in this um Clause um with the exception of the rest of the copyright Amendment act coming into play m M so let's talk a little bit about uh the importance and the urgency when it comes to these bills being um signed and implemented and what that opportunity presents yes so now that we what we have currently is that the president has now referred the B to the Constitutional court so that leaves our first um decarat order um um as something that we can no longer pursue and something that fall away in our application um so his decision today um doesn't really affect our case but has implications on our case hence we will still be going further with our alternate relief which is to request that the Constitutional Court amend this legislation and bring into effect this Clause um so that it so that the rights of those that are visually impaired and print disabled are no longer violated why this copyright Amendment act uh Bill coming into play so important is because without it South Africa cannot ratify the Marakesh treaty and the maresh treaty will allow for South Africa to access platforms like Bookshare and ABC which is the excessive book Consortium and these platforms have something like 900,000 uh audio and Braille books in accessible formats such as audio and Braille uh which will then allow for people who are visually disabled and print is able to then access hence our will p uh pursue to ensure that this piece of legislation is enacted what has the president in your view failed to do in this in this matter so in our respect we believe that this delay of the of the president's failure to enact this legislation has further discriminated against the rights of people who are blind and visually impaired but also if the president were to send it back to the Constitutional Court as he decided upon today he could have done this at an earlier Point um but he has left this for past the deadline of 21st September which was the Constitutional Court deadline for him to sign the bill and have it enacted into law so we're then going to continue pursuing our case just because what this does is it affects the daily person who is blind or visually impaired it affects the ability to study it affects the ability to read for leisure it accept it affects the ability to go about their daily life and um this is a rights violation very well thank you so much for for speaking to us this evening or perhaps Before Before We Say Goodbye um where does this matter now leave this this this case um we hoping for the presidency to file papers at the Constitutional Court we have not seen any papers being filed as yet but we are just playing it by ear ours is to pursue with our urgent um like I said earlier the fact that we cannot compel the president to sign earlier on that part of our application Falls away but we will pursue what the court to bring in this piece of legislation um on its own yes what section 172 of the Constitution thank you so much for for speaking to us this evening section 27 candidate attorney Fatima Lea there speaking about President drama paa and the copyright Amendment bill as well as performers uh protection Amendment bill that uh is around the concort matter"

sFbm3FUzMZo,GNU I Tensions arise between SACP & ANC leadership - Prof Bheki Mngomezulu weighs in,2024-10-15T20:25:43Z,17822,now tensions have Arisen between the sacp andc leadership with the a sacp accusing the gnu of betraying the national Democratic Revolution it comes after the South African Communist Party declined an invitation from its Alliance partner to celebrate the first 100 days in the government of national Unity Professor begi Gomez Zulu who's director of center for the advancement of non-racialism and democracy at Nelson Mandela University joins us for a discussion professor very good evening to you thank you so much for your time I mean that decline the sacp not uh um meeting up to that invitation to attend UMC president sir Raposa who spoke yesterday I mean that the 10 parties which constitute the gnu might differ when it comes to their key principles and intentions but he's pleaded with supporters to judge the formation on its work rather than the parties involved what what do we make of the two situations the sap on the one end and what Raa has said on the other uh good evening simp and good evening to your viewers there is something very concerning here let us be honest from the start H if you suffer from an ailment and the doctor makes a wrong diagnosis chances are you'll never recover simply because you'll be given tablet for headache when you're suffering from a stomach ache there is no logic there the point here is is that as things stand at the moment there is nothing called government of national unity in South Africa at the moment what we have is a multi-party coalition which was assembled by the ANC by virtue of the fact that it got 40% of the national vote thereby being the highest ranking party amongst all political parties that contested the election but to call it a government of national Unity is a wrong start it's a wrong diagnosis and for all the cures that were trying to bring forth will not work that is the first point the second point then is what and thep are complaining about they are saying that the discussion that happened prior to the formation of this multiparty Coalition were not done in fness in the sense that initially the understanding was that was going to be grand Coalition between the NC and the da then later on there was a change of mind to then include other political parties which is why then you have this multi-party Coalition which was then wrongly labeled so the secp therefore is saying that as a member of the tri Alliance which comprises the ancp and Kat and maybe can add Sano as well they are feeling that they have not been given enough time to be part of the deliberations those decisions were basically forced on them as Alliance partners and then after after this multiparty Coalition had been constituted they've been basically the silent Partners so to speak and the da more especially Helen Z has been at the loudest in this coalition government called genu which is definitely not as I've already pointed out so that is where the problems are and we are most likely to see a number of these contradicting views coming forth simply because the diagnosis is wrong and therefore the Cure will also be wrong you're saying that calling at the gnu is uh the wrong diagnosis does this mean that you are of the view that the government of national Unity uh will not see the end of its term what are your thoughts around that they may try to keep it but they won't be keeping a genu they'll be keeping a multi-party coalition H I've had engagement with some of the ministers and Deputy ministers and I've been at pains trying to explain to them what a GNU is some of them in fact are innocently calling it a GNU just to comply not because they believe it is a gen so even if they were to keep it like Minister McKenzie for example is one of the most excited ministers about this and on many occasions he even said that South Africans would give what he calls genu a chance so that even in the next 5 years they will be allowed to govern this country so they may try to keep it whether they will succeed or not as neither here or there but looking at the relations and the statements between thec and the da are I'm doubtful if it will last for the next 5 years because there are points of Divergence and there is no intention to try and converge at some point so that is a cause for concern the only reason why it is still sustained up to this point is because one thec cannot kick out everyone because it didn't get 50% second the da does no longer form a Shad of cabinet because it is now part of the multi-party Coalition and these are the bigger parties that are there the two picker parties the MK party and the eff are not part of this Coalition which would have meant that it would be a government of national Unity because by definition a government of national unity means that you bring together major political parties in an event that there was no outright winner so in this case thec the da MK party and then the eff uh which got 9% the ifp got 3% others got 0.0 something per but they are part of what is called genuine then can cannot be genu yeah so so as we evaluate all of that uh we we're learning that uh parties in the Progressive caucus such as the MK party and eff are dismissing the gnu government claiming it's hobbled by ncda disputes and of course the debates around policy taking Center Stage over the last few months and the parties are saying This is distracting the Coalition distracting the Coalition from its work in government we've just listened a short while ago to de leader John Stan hay and speaking about his party's views on the nhi saying that in its current form it will bankrupt the country and of course concerns with Clauses four and five in the Bella Bill how should that be interpreted it's a cause for concern po not just for thep nor for the ANC or any other political party for that matter but for every South African because remember the decision that are taken by our politicians are not only binding to politicians but they are binding to all of us so in this case if they take decisions that don't make sense from a practical point of view then it means that the end users you and I will be on the receiving end and therefore there will be challenges so what the secp is Raising are issues of significance in the sense that they are arguing that most of the discussions seem to have happened between thec and the da and an attempt has been made to satisfy the da the president in fact the clip that you played is on record saying that they to suspend certain part of The Bella act closes four and five to be exact simply because the da was not happy not because all other members of this coalition government were not happy but because the da was not happy so the question then is is this a grand Coalition because a grand Coalition basically means that you have two political parties that have D Divergent views on certain issues policy issues that come together because there was no outright Winer and then they constitute government had the AMC and the da come together that would have been a grand Coalition and in this case because other parties were brought in then it became a multiparty coalition then the question is who are you satisfying are you satisfying the da or are you satisfying the Coalition members or are you satisfying the tri part Alliance that is the balancing act that the president needs to basically take care of otherwise then this this a multiparty Coalition H is not going to be sustained simply because it's built on a Shaky Ground you cannot build a mansion if the foundation is not stable when you put the roof it's bound to collapse very well thank you so much for weighing in on the discussion Professor beg Gulu who's director of the center for the advancement of non-racialism and democracy at the Nelson Mandela University expanding there

8eJAJ2-HcYQ,Dep. Minister Bernice Swarts on recycling of e-waste and unused electronics,2024-10-15T18:48:14Z,515,"welcome back thank you very much for staying with us the Department of Forestry fisheries and environment is tackling E-Waste among others enforcing legislative and Regulatory measures to contribute to pollution reduction resource conservation and effective energy consumption the department is encouraging the public to recycle their E-Waste and take their unused Electronics to their nearest e-w collection points to discuss this further we're joined by Benise swatz Deputy minister of Forestry fisheries and environment good evening Deputy Minister thank you very much for joining us on the program so yesterday was International ew day but before we get to the importance of the day and your call to communities let's start with a very basic just for the benefit of those who might not be aware what exactly are we talking about when we talk about ew when we talk about ew we are talking about communities and um everybody that has electronic equipment and lighting which we call Will and uh the producers and um electronic equipment and public participation in the responsible management thereof because um we all know that people buy a lot of electrical equipment but don't know that once it's not in use they it needs to be discussed as ewaste then to your call to communities to join the ew hunt by retrieving as you say Recycling and Reviving just talk us through this call what exactly are people asked to do here and what we are trying to do as the Department of Forestry fisheries and the environment through this um ew and um its importance and um why is the the international ew the important it is a global waste stream of concern due to its rapid and massive growth presenting Waste Management H challenges particularly for developing countries like South Africa and the African continent as a whole this is caused by technologically progress higher consumption limited repair options shorter produce life cycles societies growing electrification design shortcoming and in educate E-Waste management now as the department of DFE for us to be part of the global e-w monitor 2024 uh the world's generation of electric waste is rising five times faster than documented ewaste recycling and the un's for Global E-Waste monitor reveals today worldwide the annual generation of E-Waste is Rising by 2.6 million tons annually now for us to teach H the households in South Africa that we must stop holding um unused um Electronics if the IR is not working the microwave is not working the hair dry is not working anymore and even kids toys that we should not keep it in the cupboards and just throw it in the garage but that we are trying to put up a e-w um centers where you can drop of your your your unused electronic Goods now we are even trying to set it up in the deepest Ro areas because even there we know that we sometimes read in the media and in newspapers especially that in the rural areas kids would be playing in a deep freezer and lock themselves in there and that causes um that of kids playing in an unused refrigerator so that is the type of education that we must bring out to the communities of South Africa to know that we must recycle um our ewaste and it's very important to do that instead of keeping it and like I've said that in some of instances it causes that amongst kids because kids don't know that the refrigerator will close and they won't be able to open it and they will suffocate in it but for us we are saying that we need to reach the standards of the global world where each home is uh giving 11 tons of waste per household which they know that they need to drop off and recycle because if we can really go on a campaign and say people must bring out their old toys and everything you know that we'll get loads loads and trucks because people don't know that we are supposed to recyc these unused Goods so for us as a department we are really going to go on that big drive we do have currently um retailers like your pick and pce that have got a drop off centers but that is also not also really publicized but we know that people will ask us why should I take my unused goods and use my own transport and go and drop off my unused ir and toaster or anything else in a microwave so we are also trying to look at incentives we know that last year there was a drive and they were actually giving vouchers of 500 R for people to bring out their e-w and the response was very good and my argument is as well that people won't just take stuff and bring them because obviously people will tell us that it's my fuel why should I take it so I think that we just need to drive the education thereof and give the importance on why we should recycle and also but Deputy Minister pardon me for interjecting just in the interest of time we know that even waste Pickers or waste collectors have themselves played a huge role in this recycling Drive yes they are part of the whole recycling drive and waste Pickers you must know that as the department in everything we do whether we put in an incinerator like we did in Ken we make sure that the incinerator is going to separate the waste that they are going to be looking for now we also Al want to educate the waste Piers because we know that currently some people dump their E-Waste at The Dumping site where you must actually dump your other waste not the electronics and you find that the W waste Pickers are also going to take that broken iron and whatever electronic so it is also part of our program that we must also educate the waste Pickers that um when it comes to the electronics how do we recycle them and where do we take them mhm now beyond your call you're now acting against electrical and electronic equipment producers who fail to comply just take us through your enforcement action our enforcement action as the department is that we are really going to put this in enforcement because um the consumers producers Civil Society ew collectors the recyclers we are we are going to increase the awareness but when it comes to the producers themselves we have put in place legislative measures that Ensure that the right to an environment that is not harmful to health and the wellbeing is upheld the promulgation of the waste management Act and the other regulations including the extended producer responsibility which is the epr regulations which is the operationalization and the polluter pay principle assisting the management of e-w the department has also prohibited the Disposable of this waste stream to landfills to ensure that its valuable materials are recycled and recovered and also to reduce its impact on the environment because 68,000 tons of ewe has been recycled to the epr schemes the SK this theme is focusing on raising awareness to communities to declutter their homes and bring e-w to the e-w collectors and recyclers in their locations so in terms of the legislative measures we are going to make sure that producers abide by the Legislative measure that we have put in place as the department because we are going to go as far as charging producers if they do not comply because we must all take um the seriousness of people's Health into account including the producers so producers can to sell their goods and not take the responsibility of what happens when the goods are no longer in use MH no that's quite important to hold people accountable Deputy Minister thank you very much for joining us on the program that's Benise SWAT Deputy Minister for forestry fisheries and environment"

UG0d_WCDago,Food poisoning I City of Ekurhuleni warns about handling of organophosphate aka halephirimi,2024-10-15T17:54:28Z,3571,the city of uren is warning about the handling of organophosphate a toxical chemical found in red poison popularly known as halip in recent times there have been concerns about suspected cases of food poisoning among children the city is now working hard to ensure that communities understand the dangers of possible cross-contamination let's speak to director of Environmental Health in uren Dr Cher Jerry Paka who joins us live now Dr Chaka in fact pardon me thank you so much for talking to us this evening let's just start with um you know looking at some of the media reports that are suggesting that um officials when they did the testing have confirmed traces of Organo for fate where uh were actually found in the bodies of children who died in uren a year ago is this the case that's exactly the case ma'am and that's and and and when you then look at what happened here would you say is it in direct relation to what they ate or could they have come across it somewhere else uh the contamination might have happened on the food that they ate H and uh it might be an accidental contamination we not sure about that yet but uh certainly as it relates to food poisoning you know the story that is going around that food poisonings paa shops Etc uh unfortunately that's not the case in terms of all our investigations in the city around the death that happened we found out that it's Organo phosphate in one instance in for lures the family prepared and consumed sandwiches and uh the were there were two children that died of that after consuming that and over above the sandwiches they also consumed the chips which are Simba chips and we tested both and uh the positive uh traces of uh Organo phosphate was found in the home prepared sandwich and uh as relates to the chips that were bought elsewhere uh the those were found to be negative in terms of any trace of food poisoning so uh the problem that we picking up is mainly from orano phosphate uh the alic cup commonly known as alicap and in all the instances like in takani there was also an incident where we had to test uh biscuits uh and they also were found to be negative but tasing this matter further we found out that there were food fruit and vegetables that were stored by a neighbor who's selling this and why he's storing this he's also using this alicap and the contamination should have happened due to that and that's why we had this case of of of alicap Dr pardon me pardon me for coming in there two questions arise from what you're saying so I'm going to start with the first one of the family that was preparing the Cent have you engaged with them uh to present these results and what have they said we have engaged with them but because this happened in a home it's a police case that uh we actually had to leave it to the police to do s investigations and we are waiting the outcome of the police investigation okay and then what is this Aldi cup what is it it's an Organo phosphate sold in the street H you know packaged by individuals and it's mainly used uh to kill rodents and rats in the family I mean people use it for that particular purpose but it's mainly an agricultural pesticide that that is actually not safe for human consumption so the challenge that we have is communities continue uh getting this and this is an illegal product by the way it's not supposed to be in the street and therefore the Department of Agriculture is also coming in to assist us in terms of uh removing this uh from the streets so if it's not supposed to be in the streets why is it in the streets to begin with ma'am it's just like any legal product that we find in the street people would be selling them illegally H and they wouldn't even show that they are selling the product and uh because uh there is that you know Fame about it being very effective in killing rats and unfortunately uh in some of the cases it's now even you know used as a a product that that is um used to kill human beings it's so unfortunate about this but uh yeah we trying as much as possible to involve the Department of Agriculture to assist in terms of removing the product from the streets and also ensuring that we educate communities around the dangers of this Organo for Speed is uh the department moving with speed to address this ER unfortunately there's not much capacity in the Department of Agriculture but us as a city we are trying our best to ensure that uh with the limited resources that we have we educate our communities about the dangers of this dise and this is also mainly driven from our provincial office which is actually the comp their competence to actually educate communities on alicap so you speak you speak about this and just a short while ago we were in conversation with Steve maona who speaks for the Kang education department and he was saying that as a department they quite concerned about what is taking place in zakani because there are children for example who are taking their own lives using this poisonous susp substance as well so are you in fact experiencing this as well and what are you doing with it ma'am we can only suspect we not sure whether this is done deliberately but when you analyze some of the cases that we coming across uh you might you know conclude that yeah people are taking their life and they are taking other people's lives using this particular product but that cannot be confirmed by us it's not our competence uh yeah the best that we're doing is just to provide education and you know I think many people are viewing this interview they'll take it home as well to ensure that H the communities must take it upon themselves to ensure that we totally remove this product from our street especially because you're talking about communities and I'm listening to what you're saying there's a possibility of cross-contamination as well um that is now I believe taking place given the fact that some of the food may be stored with some of these poisonous substances not being very far let's speak to someone who is doing just that who is possibly running a small business and putting everything in the same room because this may be dangerous exactly this is the situation especially the takani cave this is a fruit the person sells fruit and vegetables and because he's also confronted with infestation of rodents uh he's using that uh unknowingly that he's contaminating food and therefore he's exposing his customers to you know you know serious conditions that might result in death so basically we are also ing that there is education actually what should happen is the total removal of this product from our streets that's the solution yeah and Dr chuga one would definitely agree with you and we will follow up with the Department of Agriculture to see what exactly are they doing to assist you in that regard because as you say it is illegal it is poisonous and of course some people may be storing it uh hoping that it's going to be effective in order for them not to lose their stock because they're running a business but it's posing as a serious danger but thank you so much for your time appreciate it and as you say I do hope those who are watching are taking heed and actually understand how dangerous this is that was the director of Environmental Health in uren Dr Jerry Chaka
SZxHNoinoms,Two Pot system I SARS says R21.4 billion paid-out in savings benefit withdrawals,2024-10-15T17:50:25Z,4781,all right to this story now the South African Revenue Service has revealed that as of the 11th of October it has received more than 1.2 million applications for Tex directives for withdrawals from retirement fund members saving components now SAR says a gross amount of 21.4 billion has been paid out in savings benefit withdrawals joining us to discuss this further is sar's commissioner Edward kveta good evening commissioner thank you very much for joining us on the program commissioner if we weren't certain that South Africans desperately needed the additional funds the 1.2 million applications have confirmed that they were in need of those funds just talk us through this process and how T tax officials have been managing thus far uh thank you was a a real as well retirement funds so just so that uh for the listeners um when an individual decides to make a withdrawal he or she would apply to their funds their funds would then apply to s for a directive um the directive that is issued by S determines what is the tax that must be withheld um from the individual as it is quite commonly known and has been communicated that the amount that will be paid out will be subject to tax um so so this is when we say that so far over 1.35 million directive applications have been requested uh this is via the individuals uh or from the individuals via the funds um and of that what we have also done on our part we've asked um individuals to make sure to allow for the process to not be held up we've asked them to make sure that all their Affairs are in order they have no outstanding issues with SARS because if there is debt owing to s s will also withhold the debt now we understand that of course 1.2 million have applied 1.1 were approved now of those applications that have been declined what have you found to be the common issues with the applications the main so first of all um the when an application is reached the funds the funds would also do their own check and the main reason for sar's uh withholding a a a a directive would be generally related to an ID number validation failure um and 40% of the directives that have been declined relates to um an inconsistency or an issue with ID number that cannot be matched uh 23% of of those validations sorry of those that have been declined relates to failures of an invalid tax number so mainly those two issues and then also about one in every uh uh five of the directive that we've declined relates to uh more than one um directive that weed for so when there's a duplicate directive then clearly SARS will only um respond to one now we also understand that you've issued a warning for those who are apparently understating their taxable income just talk to us about this conduct that you've now noted so when so we've noticed two things firstly either individuals um cleare that they have no income currently which means that uh they do this so that they trigger a lower uh tax that is withheld now clearly SARS will pick that up and this is in fact in law stly speaking declaring an income which is lower or incorrect is in fact a false EV of tax and an individual is subject to yeah to penalties and so we are saying to individuals make make sure that you don't uh declare an income that is incorrect make sure that you don't mistake things eventually when the fining season for the subsequent year is done then any uh mismatch or anything that um did not was not correctly will be eventually reconciled an individual will either then sit with a huge penalty or with a huge tax B uh which will get them into further trouble and then commissioner what of those who seek to cancel their tax withdrawal once they see that the amount to be darted by SARS is quite high is this even permissible well they would then have to um liaz with their Pension funds because remember s um does not pay out the money um SARS really gives a directive to the pension fund that they must withhold certain amounts as an agent of SARS before they pay out the balance so when an individual eventually receives the final amount that is paid out and they then choose uh to cancel it that would be a matter between them and the relevant fund and all the funds will obviously have various ways of engaging with um with the with the individual either online or they would obviously have help lines and other ways of engaging this would not be a matter between the individual and S and then commissioner just in closing the country is mning of course the passing of the former Finance Minister D bweni and of course as Finance Minister he would have worked closely with SARS can you share encounters with Mr boeni that stand out for you I think what is remarkable about Kon buen uh firstly he was a colorful uh individual very unconventional but beyond this and often you know this is uh what stands out but behind this colorful and fiercely independent uh individual is uh someone who had committed his life as an active AC IST and a fighter for democracy and whether it was as a young minister of Labor who spearheaded uh a remarkable transformation of our labor legislation coming from our very divided past uh to restore Equity into the workplace already then which was the first time I met him as a young he was a young minister of Labor I was a young power plant manager for esum um and he came and he shared the thinking behind the new legislation uh in in his case he used the labor law to further Advance his fight for justice and for democracy imping improving the material conditions of people and so later on uh when he moved into the governor's mansion and The Reserve Bank clearly he again saw this as an opportunity to contribute towards our democracy I think it's it's important that we pause for a moment and reflect that during that 10 years under the leadership of President Becki the Minister of Finance then Manel and tabi and and TI buen we experienced the most stable decade uh economically in our history in our 30 year history and it was under the Sterling leadership of a clear and independent Reserve Bank uh that led monetary policy and a fiscal policy that sought to dig ourselves out of a technical and fiscal insolvency practically um and a revenue collection Authority that was improving uh that South Africa reached that really the a high point and and one looks back and wishes that we can get back there uh so that our fiscal balance our fiscal Integrity can in fact be a sound basis for the important demands on fiscal resources for our government commissioner thank you very much for your time this evening that's Edward kvet sar's commissioner there speaking to us
PVm-PVEvD_4,Food Poisoning | 48 Hammanskraal learners rushed to hospitals : Steve Mabona shares more,2024-10-15T17:44:24Z,9452,48 Learners from rapo primary school in New estas in hamans were rushed to different medical facilities yesterday following a suspected case of food poisoning we try again to get the details as to what exactly happened here we speak to hting Department spokesperson um Steve mabona and of course he speaks for the education department Steve let's try again what do we know happened here well according to information at our disposal is that one grade seven learner sold some chocolates to their fellow lers and which then resulted into them being rushed into different medical facilities they were admitted there yesterday up until very um last night and some of them were then discharged this morning throughout the day after being attended to medically do we know what symptoms they were presenting after eating this chocolate look we understand that it was more about stomach cramps some feeling nauseous and um that's why then our officials had to call the emergency services ambulances came and we then they were very to different you know medical facilities where to reroot some of them take them to George marari academic Hospital because we needed more space in terms of the care and all that so that's how they were managed but we are comforted that um actually all of them besides one now as we speak because earlier we had four that were remaining on hospital but now we can confirm that it's only one learner that is in still in a private hospital but all these others were discharged is that learner according to your understanding still in hospital because of the seriousness of their condition well I would I wouldn't be in a position to have more information on that but we were told that the lner is stable so we put the L in our prayers and hopefully that the L will also be released or discharged rather in the m cter and are tests now being conducted on this particular particular chocolate to determine if it is indeed the cause of what happened yes we there's confirmation that the chocolates were you know taken by the health officials as it were you know that they will conduct necessary tests and they should be in a position to then share with um all relevant authorities including parents on the results you know on the the the the chocolates as it way but uh yes we can confirm that one learner was responsible for this and sold allegedly this chocolates to fellow lers and what in terms of the processes unfold now as far as that learner is concerned and um even the teachers as well what happens now look we have dispatched our psycho support team to go to the School especially tomorrow now that most of them has been discharged in the event they come to school then they need to be supported but you know that parents will be worry you want probably to monitor their children and which is understandable and we should be in a position then to reach out to them and check the support that they need and they they they should be assisted we work very closely with the Department of Health you know just to make sure that we we support the you know the children and I know that the outbreak team will be on the ground just to educate in the school on what is it that you need to consume what is it that you need to look out for if a product the sell by date is you know it's gone is expired what is it that you need to look out for so those are the you know interventions that will be you know making sure that we unleash at the school and Steve I wonder how much of a concern is it for the Department that we are now um in recent times again hearing of cases of alleged poisoning as far as children are concerned and then we are hearing again um from the city of uren for example that children last year who died may have come into contact in one way or another with a gun of force fate and that is of course known in the townships as alip and now of course maybe that may not be contained in what they had to eat but they did come across it somehow cuz it was found um in tracers when they were conducting the test how concerned is the department around possib the possibility of cross-contamination in various forms that we are seeing now no quite concerning but the issue of we are quite aware of many cases of alleged suicides or Learners wanting to take their lives which some of them would have left notes on why they are doing that in Sak we is a problem area for us when coming to such cases and yes indeed I mean halip has been one of the detriment product that has been utilized by some of the Learners so we just want to question that's why we work very closely with sadak to say let's conduct necessary you know education let's make sure that Learners when they are distressed who do they talk to so that they can then be assisted professionally yeah and as you say if it is a problem area it certainly signals that there's something deeper going on there um and Steve thank you so much for talking to us this evening and we will be in convers with the city of e as well to see what are they doing um to ensure that they also deal with some of the concerns that you are raising tonight that's the spokesperson of theing Education Department Steve maon
463COOsoQOI,DA in Gauteng accuses Lesufi of enabling a corruption cover-up: Dr Tim Maake weighs in,2024-10-15T17:31:20Z,10689,now the da in Ken has accused premier banyaza lufi of enabling a corruption cover up the party claims the premier is withholding over 50 forensic reports in a bid to hide corruption the part is also raising questions around whether or not an investigation has been instituted regarding the allegations of corruption at theen Department of Education let's now discuss this with local government specialist Dr Tim M who's joining us live now Dr M good afternoon to you and thank you so much for your time your view what's going on here good afternoon uh to you and the viewers I think uh in my view we we need to brace ourselves for a continued antagonistic relationship between the Democratic Alliance and the African National Congress in the Kon Province let's remind the viewers that what we are observing uh today as as as the Press briefing of The Da regarding the release of the forensic investigation reports it's a continuation of the deadlock that took place between the da and thec in the establishment of a government of provincial Unity we know what happened thereafter we know what happened in the city of JC where in the the the the African National Congress together with other small parties uh were able to you know constitute a coalition government exclusive of the democratic Alliance and just recently the the the the action say thec and other parties were able to unseat the Democratic Alliance within the city of Tu now all of those things talks to the fact that in the in the in the province of hting as opposed to the National political space the relationship between the Democratic Alliance and the African National Congress is non-existent and and that is the reason why we see the da going to the public raising several issues which will look very legitimate they will look very sound but in the main there are underlying factors and the underlying factors is the disagreements which they had post the national and provincial government elections that's exactly what we are seeing it it sounds like um while you say there are questions that must be asked about the allegations they're making um the there also might be politics at play if I'm getting you correctly is that what you're saying that that's that's true precisely because you would you would note the fact that if there are any reports that are withheld by any person there a legal recourse that the da could have activated and the first one is just to formally request the the the access to the reports that the premier might be holding at his disposal and that's where they can use the promotion of access to information act to compel the premier to share with them whatever reports but equally important the Democratic Alliance is part of the government in the hon Province even though they are not part of the Coalition Arrangements but they sit within the legislature and that's another platform where they could be able to request the legislature to call the premier to account on the reasons why he not able to release those reports pardon me pardon me they do say though that the speaker in the um howang provincial legislature did not deem their questions urgent that that's the point that I was going to go to to say failure for the legislature to give them a hearing they also have got a legal recourse to approach the court for the court to force the premier to release the report so that the public can get to know what is actually happening this is precisely because calling for a media briefing will still not result give the intended result which is having access to the reports if the fundamental issue here is to say let's be transparent obviously the courts are available to give anyone a legal recourse where they believe that somebody's un is withholding information without a good cause so hence the issue of the continued relationships between thec Inon province and the da would continue to be at play and that is something that we need to be observing from time to time that does not mean the the the point of wanting the reports to to be uh released is not legitimate the point is legitimate but the question is the timing and the platform wherein these reports needs to be processed that's an issue that needs to be watched with a cautious eye so they saying that they will be referring um these allegations to the Public Service Commission is that the right platform in your view well referring the the the allegations to the Public Service Commission one needs to appreciate the fact that the Mandate and the role of the Public Service Commission is quite very clear the the Public Service Commission is there to deal with the conduct of public servant and in this case the issue it's about a public representative who does not want to release a document which is of public interest and and the appropriate platforms as I've already mentioned could have been the legislature in the if the legislature fails then the courts will be there to make sure that those who are in the executives are held accountable by the legislature and if the legislature is failing to hold the executive to account then the court will compel the legislature to perform its oversight responsibilities but taking the matter to the Public Service Commission it would have worked if they are going there to say director General so and so it's not cooperating with us and would want you as the Public Service Commission to look at his conduct against the provisions of section 195 which requires the public service to be professional the public service to be uh transparent and to be uh able to make sure that information that is required by the public is made available so that would have been an appropriate and relevant platform but at this level surely I think a different approach could have been the one that would have been considered if the interest is to make sure that the reports are made public it's going to be an interesting one because they're also claiming that there are certain officials and that they accused of soliciting bribes and all of that but now we've just seen in a statement that the Ken Premier tomorrow will be briefing the media um and they he will of course talk about the recent allegations as well um that have been leveled against him what are you expecting well it's it's not surprising one was definitely awaiting a moment where in the Premier is also going to go public and convene a press briefing for him to be able to respond to the allegations that the leader of the democratic Alliance has has labeled against him and these are the this is a trend that we have been observing uh over a period of time that once the Da goes uh to brief the media we know for a fact that the the premier or the chairperson of the NC in the hton province would also go public and make sure that he he tries to respond and clarify the the issues that will be at hand it is for that reason that we say going to call a press briefing to deal with something of critical importance such as the release of documents may not be the correct platform to ventilate otherwise the appropriate platform would have been to approach the court let's be mindful of the fact that if there are allegations of individuals that might be involved in wrongdoing obviously the the pieces of legislations in the country calls upon those of us who might have access to such information to report those to the police otherwise we will be considered as also as enabling those corrupt activities to continue unabated so it's a matter of having to be careful when we deal with matters of law making sure

CY3E7Fcb0Pw,JSC interviews I Chris Oxtoby on the selection criteria and shortlisting process,2024-10-15T17:24:42Z,530,all right let's take you back to one of our top stories and that is of course the JSC interviews that are currently underway that is day six of course we're wrapping the day with Chris Oobi freedom and law research consultant Chris good afternoon to you thank you so much for your time and of course we were talking last week about some of the candidates and what we were um you know watching unfold before our eyes including that one candidate who was there um vying for a multiple number of you know positions but at the same time hoping to catch one and thus issues of criteria and I'm Keen to hear your thoughts um a little later on when it comes to the issue of criteria and whether or not you think it's being dealt with but what are your impressions this week and how things have gone well I mean it's been a a dramatic week I think the uh interviews uh yesterday for the Western cap judge president position were always going to be um a dramatic moment because obviously this is uh taking the place uh that was vacated when uh the former judge president clope was impeached and we saw an unusually um contested position where we had seven candidates being interviewed it's very unusual for that many candidates to be putting themselves um into the ring at the same time um and of course uh we we saw quite a lot of dirty laundry about the uh the Western Cape Court being being aired so I think that was a a dramatic uh a dramatic day uh today somewhat less dramatic with um entry level positions for that Court uh being being interviewed um I think overall and perhaps to touch slightly on your criteria point I think there are some encouraging signs from how the JSC has been going about its work um there is certainly a a rigor that many of the Commissioners are bringing to interrogating candidates uh judgments candidates understanding of the law um and that's something that has has often not been the case uh from the JSC in the past so I think that's an encouraging development um I think there are also promising signs in how chief justice Meyer has been chairing the JSC she has been praised in the past for how she's chaed it when she's uh filled in as deputy chief justice um but I think you can see she's been very proactive to try and get on top of uh issues of timekeeping quite early she's been been quite quick to to cut Commissioners off when she feels that they've been straying from uh from relevant questions um or when the that we had too many too many bites of the Cherry um and that's important because staying to time has been something the JSC has struggled with a lot um so I think those are those are promising signs but of course uh the some of the challenges that the the Judiciary does face um are are clear to see thinking particularly of some of the challenges in the Western Cape court and speaking about the Western Cape Court I'm going to get to the challenges and just a moment but I'm Keen to hear your thoughts on how the interview um with judge Patricia Goliath in fact folded because we saw quite a lengthy one um and also a number of questions that really raised some serious serious eyebrows about what exactly is going on in that Court look I think it's been well known for a long time that there has been some serious uh tensions and difficulties uh between the judges within the court there have been several uh complaints lodged by uh judges against other judges which is which is unusual but we've seen that happen in the Western Cape Court um I think the uh the the whole leadership issue with the former judge president CL having been uh under that cloud for so long which then led to his uh removal from Office that's clearly had an impact on the functioning of the court and on the uh the relationship between judges so I do to an extent feel a little sorry for for judge Goliath to have uh picked up that uh that that poison chalice in a way um because I think it was it was always going to be a difficult task to uh to take over in an acting capacity while the uh whole situation with former judge CL uh resoled itself but that having been said I think it was also clear from a lot of what came out in yesterday's interview that there were also problems in terms of how she herself was uh was running the court so you know at the end of the day I think we could we can just hope that uh the uh the new judge president being being appointed is going to make a difference I think it was quite significant the JSC appointed somebody who although they had sat on the court in the past judge Mendler Pana she has been on the Supreme Court of Appeal most recently so although she's got a connection to the Western cap court she's also um coming into it slightly more fresh than some of the other candidates um and one would have expected um for example judge Goliath to know where to fix especially given the history um that we've seen in that Court over time and one possibly could say because you've also raised even concerns with the former judge president yourself surely you should know where to fix and in the almost two years that you were in the position this should have been your priority areas yeah I think that's a it's it's a fair point I mean it's I I I can appreciate that it may be difficult for someone who's in a position like that on a on an acting basis uh perhaps that uh that that that may hinder them in in some way to address these challenges um but I think it's it's no coincidence that uh two of the most difficult interviews uh yesterday were both hers and the acting Deputy judge president uh judge Dei and the JSC was was uh very clear I mean it was saying it in in terms to uh to both of these judges that they had concerns about how the court had been functioning under their leadership um so as I say although I do have have a certain um sympathy with uh somebody who picks up uh a leadership position in such a difficult environment on an acting or temporary basis um clearly the JSC felt that uh both of those candidates could have done more to address some of these issues and in some cases there seems to be an undercurrent that um that that this leadership was in fact perpetuating some difficulties some of the issues around lack of communication with judges and those kind of questions um so I think it it on balance wasn't surprising that we saw the JSC looking to make something of a fresh start in the the appointment that it's recommended and as you say let's see if indeed it becomes a fresh start particularly um as we've seen in the past how troubled um relations have been and strained in that particular quot but thank you so much Chris appreciate your time this afternoon that's Chris Oobi their freedom under law research consultant
V9PVu9jYaa8,Tito Mboweni | Friends and colleagues pay homage to Mboweni's family in his Killarney house,2024-10-15T16:30:49Z,3590,now there's been a city stream of friends and colleagues to the house of the late Reserve Bank Governor T in Johannesburg to pay their last respects Let's cross live now to Sam maso who is at the Home Sam good afternoon to you and thank you so much for your time with saw just a short while ago Matthew Spa the former treasurer of thec what has he said indeed bong the former treasury general of thec Matthew paa was here to pay homage to the Tito M family on the passing of the former minister of finance of the country the former Governor of The Reserve Bank the eth and the former minister of Labor basically saying that when he was the treasurer general of the ANC they would joke with Tito boeni in saying that T boen is the treasurer of the nation and Matthews paa is the treasurer of the African National Congress saying that they have drank and ate from the same plate they have struggled together and they he was particularly shocked and pbed with the sudden departure of TI when he did not anticipate that he would depart the land of the living at such a young age of 65 years of age and also sharing some of the moments they shared together within the national executive committee of the African National Congress some of the moments they shed together in the trenches within the structures of thec and how tieni spoke his mind no matter what What it Took within the structures of thec going back to those particular debates where matth posa was no longer a member of the NC but the likes of tieni took it upon themselves to take up that battle against the then former president of the African National Congress who was the president of the country as well that would be former president Jacob Zuma where they were saying he must step down as the President of the Republic of South Africa of course there has been a steady stream of those who are coming to offer the you know condolences but also support to the family let's speak about other figures who came to be in support of the family at this difficult time the ANC Secretary General LED an ANC NC delegation to the family home of he was accompanied by the national organizer of thec Manana he was also alongside the Secretary General of the ANC women's league TK the provincial secretary there was M the spokesperson of the African National Congress and also who is the Deputy chairperson of thec in the province of and who is the regional Secretary of the ANC here in the greater Johannesburg region AIG lalula spoke about the lives and times they shared with tieni how tieni would call him to get an update on the political developments within thec the battles between the ANC and the provincial executive committee of Kang and also just to get an update on the formulation of the government of a national unity and Sam we do understand that funeral details have now been made available are you able to share them with us the funeral details point in time have not yet been made available I've not seen them as yet officially we have spoken to the family we do know that the burial service will take place in zanin over the weekend it will take place at a particular Stadium within the area of zanin and comes from it has not yet been officially communicated last I checked by government I have not yet seen anything coming from the presidency I'm just going to go back to my phone once again and check if there any updates uh from the presidency if it will indeed be a category 2 uh funeral that is being designated by President Raposa like we saw with the former Minister of Finance that would be proven Gordon I have not seen any communication on my phone as yet but we do know that uh the family thec they are anticipating that the union buildings the Petoria will make some sort of announcement later this evening and of course some you know quite a number of people remember him and his contribution as you say when it comes to not mincing his words whether it is about the issues of the day whether it is about politics and of course even his views on the government of national Unity as well and shortly after the elections um what he felt was being done to the NC by former president Jacob Zuma through the controverses of party indeed Bo was very vocal on political issues he was not those particular people who were dogged on approach and particularly sticking to party line he does not he would not stick to party line particularly when things were going wrong and the wheels were falling off particularly when you look at the era of former president Jacob Zuma I remember onec NEC meeting it was himself and Derek hanom who took the battle to former president Jacob Zuma to seek for him to be removed as the President of the Republic of South Africa remember on that particular weekend I think it was the wedding of onec NC member in the form ofina in the Western Cape in Stalin B when that particular motion of or that particular debate on the resignation of former president Jacob Zuma was tabled in the national executive committee meeting NC members had to fly overnight from the Western Cape to come to St George's hotel where the ANC NC meetings used to take place after that particular debate was brought into the NC by the likes of Tien and D within that national executive committee you go to how he was very vocal after the elections in asking former president Jacob Zuma on Twitter whether it is personal or political for him to do what he did to thec with the formation of the MK party and ultimately dipping thec under 50% he was very vocal on how the e was badly hammered at the election saying that they must not be erased from the political scene within the country they will bounce back hence you've seen Jules malama embracing they have had their own political differences particularly over the fiscal monetary policy of the country and other econ and other economic issues but of late you remember speaking on the issue of the State Bank speaking on the issue of the nationalization on the beneficiation of South Africa's minerals and also speaking on other economic issues that should be undertaken by Treasury and the sou African Reserve Bank and also speaking against the national ation of The Reserve Bank all right Sam thank you so much for that comprehensive update there that was by my colleague Sam maso just outside the home of the former Reserve Bank governor and of course the late d

greetings to all the all of South Africa as well look it's it's it's a difficult one for a farmer I must say um these adversary weathers have become a normal um if it's not floods it's drought if it's not drought it's Frost if it's not Frost it's fires it's it's it's become so difficult because as a farmer you need to harvest your crop and again put aside for planting again in the new season we thank the department for the launching of the multipling season but it is allocated for only a few because government cannot afford to sub subsidize all Farmers I must say uh the past season has been tough the drought has actually affected us we did not make money we lost money in the past season and it's making it hard even for the banks to finance us to get back to the fields again lucky are those that are actually getting C funding and I mean some of the stories that we've been hearing by some of our journalists that are covering this uh you know hearing of how owners say their cattle die as they get stuck in the mud while they search for water in those dried up dams I mean uh what assistance if any are you then getting from government I think it is a catastrophe um government's help only comes too late um if if we can look at what is happening right now um in the areas of zululand jini around there you as you drive past you see Kettle carcasses on the on the on the on the ground um it's not only about them getting stuck in the mud it's about them not even having something to feed on or to graze on um as we speak in the sugar sector for instance there's been a significant drop in yields some are counting 15% others 20% which is like their profit if if you're not going to cut 15% of your crop it means you've lost your profit for the year um it's it's catastrophic what help we need is beyond what government can do in a quick and and and very Swift way so so we we we we as Farmers we've always been resilient I think we've we've developed a thick skin we've known that it's it's about taking a risk and farming is not a child's play and it's not a get-rich quick scheme I must warn um everyone out there that it's not a get rich quick scheme if people are so used to tenders that they quickly get their money it's not about tendering here it's about yeah we're giving your heart and soul into it it's it's a livelihood that if this year I lost you come again the following year hoping that you'll come back and make some money and I mean just listening to Premier nuli saying and calling on traditional leaders in fact in the province to play a meaningful role in ensuring that subsistence farmers are assisted in order to curb hunger and and poverty I mean how far will their intervention as traditional leaders assist do you think well um especially for small scale Farmers those the farmers are farming on communal land that is land administer by um traditional leaders we are appealing on all traditional leaders to support the substance farmer in terms of firstly 10 year security ensuring that even if it's a goo or a a widow or an old man they mustn't you know feel insecure about land but also you know when farming into vegetables your neighbor has got livestock there's got to be some some level of of of protection for for the for the for for the for the for the vegie farmer generally you find that livestock raise over people's uh you know people's produce and there's no consequence thereafter but isas and and and you know leaders have got a role to play in the peacekeeping and ensuring that people protect are protected in their lands and also availing the land I mean the youth as as it where is crying out it's crying foul I mean you got so many graduates out there with no land to farm and there is land in the communal space and and that land sometimes is more fertile than even those on the farms but all it but what it needs is a lot of infrastructure devel velopment I mean you would Appeal on government to actually clear the bushes and put some fences and allow the youth to start farming and that's where you're going to create jobs there are not jobs as it way so so we heard also that the department of Kulu natal um Department of Agriculture in in that Province will be assisting particularly cattle owners in the in this draft um in in in the draft hit areas we know of course we saying for Regions uh I'm concerned about your earlier comment saying you know uh as much as you appreciate the help from government it's not going to go a long way so the question then becomes what are the longstanding you know uh imple implementations that need to happen here uh particularly pertaining to that outcome of the summit that was held in the province recently I mean from a long-term perspective what then needs to happen because we we are going to see these weather patterns continue uh going forward you know in the event of climate change Etc oh God I wish I had an answer um you know climate change as you rightly say it's an act of God it's beyond anyone's control and even our own government cannot really um be swift enough to react promptly on on issues of climate change remember no one knows particular it happens that the catastrophe is coming and perhaps sometimes even too late that we hear that the Cyclone is coming and people haven't even done anything to protect themselves so so I think it's it's a question of accepting that we are in a phase where we are facing adverse weathers Farmers need to start now farming in a climate friendly way try and and be ready for these kinds of of disasters and prepare themselves in time I think we we got to assist our government as much as we can because government will not have all the resources we need but I must say we appreciate what government does but you know SCM processes would take too long sometimes for assistance to get to the farmer in time in time of me so it's a question of of knowing your space as a farmer knowing where your health is and knowing that it may not come in time and be always prepared to actually you know close the gap I'm happy that in the sugar industry we've sort of advanced quite quickly we've bought our our small scale Farmers some yellow plant yellow equipment to ensure that if there are floods and the roads are washed away they can quickly put their own plant into action and and repair their road so that they can extract their their produce which has been difficult in the past years waiting for provincial transport to come come through for them and more so it's access roads which are not generally being looked after so at least there is some action there in the sugar industry I must appla the sugar industry for being proactive on that I think other sectors also need to do that start helping government bring in what you can in terms of infrastructure development and also you know yellow plant yellow equipment to assist the road infrastructure in the rural space so I think what we need to do is is it's gear up as industry gear up as as as a sector because we we we cannot de 100% government absolutely Dr Malala thank you so much for your time uh that's all the time we have unfortunately Dr cabonga madala is a chairman of the South African Farmers Development Association looking at those drought stricken regions in quaz Nal

fnyJGNBOeAM,South African Auto Week 2024 celebrates 100 years,2024-10-15T14:36:12Z,827,"Africa's automobile industry continues to evolve as it celebrates 100 Years of its existence this year industry leaders are gathered in Cape Town this week seeking ways to drive localization increasing export and creating jobs the automotive industry conference is taking place at a time when the sector is facing significant headwinds it continues to face low demand for vehicles owing to a depressed Market as well as the transition to electric vehicles sabc news reporter diosito is in Cape Town for us and she joins us now thank you so much diabo for joining us we spoke to you earlier uh who do you have as a guest this time n yes we spoke earlier and I did tease out to you that TransUnion just issued a statement uh where they published their latest vehicle pricing index for the second quarter of this year which among other indications shows that electric vehicle adoption is growing and driven by younger consumers as well as Financial Innovation I did manage to catch up with the CEO of TransUnion uh Mr Lee Nike who's going to tell us a little bit about this index and what other interesting findings there have been thank you so much Mr Nike for making time to speak to us here on the sabc uh a be fitting time for you to be issuing this uh vehicle price index and it's findings particularly about the adoption of Eves among young consumers what is attracting them so much to electric vehicles is it you know the growing Trend or is it maybe the modernization of the automobile industry well the reality is that the entire Market has changed globally in places like China One of every four vehicles is in fact an electric vehicle now let's be real in South Africa we're still starting we have seen an increase in quarter to on the sale of electric vehicles but it still makes up less than 1% of vehicle sold why is it interesting to our youngsters they are more conscious about the Earth and about sustainability and they're looking to put their money behind purchases that are good for the planet and are good for their future they also believe that by supporting EVS they have more control of their finances and there's a genuine belief that by going off EV Vehicles they'll spend less money in future than on Ice Vehicles yeah there's still some drop a significant quite in fact 6% decline um in new vehicle sales and then another 6.1 drop drop in uh total vehicle Finance from the previous quarter is this indicative generally of the state of the consumer finances um in general well absolutely the consumers are highly stressed right now you must remember that we've just had a 25 basis point decrease which in real terms on an average consumer that has a million Rand home loan and a 350,000 r c it's only made a difference of 314 r a month so it's early days and the consumers are highly stressed you must remember it's been a long time since we've had an interest rate cut in fact as far back as May 2020 three and with a higher cost of food and fuel it's cost them a lot more but the good news is that we've had an interest rate cut and just recently we're a 220 decrease in the cost of petrol so we starting to see an easing but what the data reveals to us it's too early in the cycle and consumers have deprioritized purchases and focused rather on their living expenses because every day it's hard to manage a household budget in a tough economy yeah is this why also seen that those who have used vehicles uh keep them for much longer and those that do have the choice to buy a vehicle they would rather go for every used vehicle absolutely we found this trend post pandemic where consumers priorities have changed as opposed to buying a new vehicle they realize it's tougher to run their budgets but equally so they've realized that maybe they don't need two cars in their household and they're downgrading from having two cars to one car and they're choosing a larger crossover an older SUV what we found in our data is you have greater utility in a used car so people are being much more conscious knowing that their rans need to go a lot further and by focusing on a used vehicle greater utility their rans will go a lot longer yeah what interesting Trends are you seeing in terms of financing of vehicles any innovative solutions coming up on stream that one should be aware of especially at a time where um consumers are strong well there's two big trends right now the biggest trend is a concept we call micromobility we're going to see more and more people using bicycles or even ebikes to move around in a market where we can't afford vehicles e-mobility or micr Mobility will start to become a trend the second more prevalent trend is something we call Mobility as a service people that can't access vehicle financing they may actually rent to buy or leas to buy or they may just buy a car for a period of time the real Trend we're seeing right now specifically in the younger Generations those born after 1981 they are telling us very very clearly they have a very very different view on cars whereas we may have a specific context or connection with a vehicle brand all the youngsters want to do is to move around to access job opportunities and to move around for business or lifestyle so cars are becoming de prioritized in their context and their view is how do I use car to live my life or to work versus chasing a brand like they have tradition all right M Len thank you I know you have to run thank you so much for speaking to us here on the sabc we really appreciate your input I've been speaking to the CEO of TransUnion Mr lak and he's been telling us about their vehicle pricing uh index that they've released this morning and that gives us very interesting Trends we are at the South African Auto Week here in Cape Town where uh from tomorrow we'll see a much more busier stalls behind me today it's really more of a media day where they're introducing us to the speakers that are going to be there so far we spoke spoken to nams and of course just now TransUnion we'll be speaking to other players such as financiers and Banks to find out about some of the Innovative approaches that they have um in terms of financing vehicles um and also consumption patterns and also credit worthiness of consumers uh to what extent that is also impacting on people going out to look for cars"

Secretary General of thec over to you samele shall we get started colleagues good afternoon members of the media um on the occasion of uh the African National Congress led by the Secretary General com fig balula and the leadership of thec in Ken Province and the sheny of the ANC coming to pay respects at the home of our late comeni the SG is going to make remarks and we will take questions um after that and preferably questions that are limited to why we are here thank you very much over to USG uh well thank you very much ladies and gentlemen of the media uh we are here to pass our condolences to the moeni family uh were well received by the family U the children of com ditto and family members and we are with Alto Moen here uh who the cousin of comrade ditto but he will not take any questions uh we wanted to come to them uh to say to them we share with them the grief and we extend our condolences on behalf of the African National Congress um we will the family will be going to Limpopo as you all know that the funeral uh will be on Saturday and it has been declared I think a state funeral I don't know which category uh but the president in zanin in limo we are discussing with the family our plans as thec uh to have a memorial service uh to celebrate the life of comrade Tito and uh that we intend to do it uh maybe after the the funeral so that we get the right speakers and uh also proper planning uh for the memorial service I'm also with the provincial Secretary of uh our Province here in hting and also members of thec Branch comrade Tito was a member of thec Branch here in Kilani uh so when you come here you'll get lost because you you looking for an estate uh so he was a bachelor he used to stay here alone and he love it so much and he will drive many hours to Limpopo the Juke of Maka CL and they do that cooking that you all enjoyed uh on Twitter and everywhere else uh but uh he was a good uh person to be around and like I said when I was speaking to haidi That comr Tito was very generous uh he was no longer a member of the national executive committee of the NC by his choice he decid no I'm giving you young chaps uh to uh to take over but uh he was not missing in action he will call me I called him uh the brother leader so his call uh will come in and uh gnu will discuss he will also share his ideas he will ask and question what's happening about this and that in the organization and give his advice so we have lost really we are poorer without him as a as a movement as a people of South afria afria um as a whole I mean uh we are saying to the family draw Sol from the knowledge that you are not alone uh we have all lost uh with the passing of comrade ditto thank you very much thank you very much with that I'm going to invite members of the media who wishes to fire our away can I look um news 24 just a small question we've seen tributes pouring in from across political parties please speak to us about what kind of leader he was think considering that I mean the eff has even chipped in it's a there's a lot of remarks being made about the type of Vader he was could you please speak to us about that thank you uh we are also with the deputy chairperson of comrade nantu uh also our MEC of Health uh sorry for confusing her to be a branch a branch uh there is a regional leader as well here as so I must mention all of them the people with titles and of course we have members of the family here uh comrade ditto was a an intellectual no doubt about did he was an economist um uh he was an allround political uh intellectual uh revolutionary intellectual uh erudite um loyal servant of the African National Congress that wasen to us uh he could interact with anyone with any topic with not difficulties uh that is what uh he was to everyone uh you may think that something is very difficult uh but comrade ditto was very easy for him to unpack and engage and he was not afraid of opponents strategic opponents uh he would not confuse a strategic opponent to an enemy he understood this that is why you will reach out to the eff you know when the efff dropped in this election he said no they are not they must not be erased in the political map they will actually come back so he was a versatile political animal but at the same time in a true ANC style he was not uh afraid of strategic opponents he understood them message because he believed in the theory of the Revolution that it is superior he was an ideologue of the African National Congress H tieni will be remembered as an architect generation H led by tabi Trev Manuel and them who laid the foundation for macroeconomic stability in this country and I remember him vividly when he was asked the question when he became the governor he said that the economic fundamentals are intact the economy is is in safe hands so let's move on and that was it this uh comrades uh when we came in we're faced with a bigger challenge uh we told the people of South Africa that we will Implement what is called RTP reconstruction and development program but uh we didn't know what is be behind the counter when we got into Power behind the counter like President Bei will also explain that when they arrived there it was only a phone and a desk and they had to navigate and when we got into Power the boas had bankrupted this economy and there was no money to fund the RDP so there was no Financial Capital to fund the Reconstruction and development program uh because we said to people who were like Father Christmas what do you want we want houses what do you want we want this and all of these things for free but here we come into power we don't don't have money to fund the RDP so they implemented H gear just like the confusion today that we thought some of us who lacked in tools of analysis that gear was a strategic goal and then they taught us that no gear is not a strategic goal it's a tactic it will be abandoned at any given point in time it is something that will help us overcome these obstacles that we are faced with we are the only economy in between Brazil and uh Cuba and not Cuba Zimbabwe that survived structural adjustment programs of the IMF and the World Bank but faced with a bigger challenge of a debt trap and the debt that was left by the apartate regime to us so tto was part of that group of leaders of thec um I say group because belonging in the same meeting does not mean you are the same generation so I hear people when I speak they think we are the same gen we are not we might be in the same leadership but we're not the same gener
CVdwGakdej4,Strengthening NPA's prosecutorial independence: Dr Jean Redpath weighs in,2024-10-15T14:10:43Z,273,National director of public prosecutions Advocate shamila batoy says she wants to use this last 18 months as ndpp to solidify the foundation she's built speaking at a seminar in Cape Town she said that the country depends on having an independent NPA the seminar was about future proofing the NPA and guarding its independence let's now bring in Dr Jean redpath from the dla Omar Institute thank you so much for your time and good afternoon to you Dr redo so the NPA has I mean under uh come under heavy criticism over the last few years particularly given the hope that shamila bto's appointment you know had just talk to us as you reflect of course um on her tenure she is saying that she wants to spend essentially the last uh few months uh as ndpp you know just solidifying the foundation that she has built yes I think she was very candid today um in the seminar and what she was basically referring to is at the end of the of the last term of the previous Parliament you will recall that there was a bill passed to amend the NPA legislation um in order to bring the investigating directorate in and that at the time the Civil Society presentations as well as the from the NPA itself really tried to push for more operational and financial Independence for the NPA um and unfortunately that did not go through at the time but there was an undertaking by the then Minister Ronald lolo that it would be dealt with early in 2025 and so I think the hope is that the operational and financial Independence will enjoy some attention from Parliament um as we go forward um so just talking about that then you know the financial aspect of the NPA of course not withstanding the independence given the history and where we come from in as far as this institution is concerned I mean How likely is that to happen given the fact that um a lot of the cases important cases particularly those that emanated from the zondo commission uh had seemingly failed so far and um you know a lot was pointed onto the fact that this is um an institution that is not while capacitated yes so the the ability of the NPA to do its job is intricately linked um to the financial and operational Independence currently we have a situation where the legislation requires the ndpp to get the permission of the minister and the director general of Justice to bring in outside skills that's in section 38 of the act the salary iies are determined on a scale that is totally unrealistic um she has no direct control over the budget herself that has to go through the director general of justice and you can imagine that in the beginning when she first came into office she was trying to um correct the wrongs of the previous uh State capture period and it is now that it's become clear um that there are these weaknesses in the leg legislation the Constitution requires the legislation to ensure that the uh NPA can operate without fear favor or Prejudice and it's it's become increasingly impared that the legislation does not do that and what she really would like to see before she leaves office is that certain changes are made to ensure that when we talk about you know um and and when we analyze just the independence component she does speak about future proofing the NPA I mean one of the examples she cited quite recently in fact when she was appearing before Parliament is that you know um cautioning the abuse of the private prosecutions to further certain agendas are quite poly talking about the Pala Pala matter for instance I want to know from you two sides in fact if that decision then by the the the NPA of course locally in in in um limo to not further you know Institute Jo charges in Pala Pala and just some of the questions that it has raised in as far as accountability um you know on the part of the NPA so the NPA policy on pursuing uh prosecutions is quite clear um there must be a primer F case in other words all the elements of the alleged crime must be there and there must be reasonable prospects of success and there you have to look at the evidence available uh and the ndpp has looked at the evidence available in this instance and has said that there are no reasonable prospects of success I would imagine that that's her reason when it comes to private prosecutions private prosecutions are actually quite Limited in the legislations from the criminal procedure act very old legislation dating from the 1970s and it's only in very limited circumstances that private prosecutions can be brought and it they can only be brought by someone with the direct interest in the matter so that would be for example the victim of an assault where the NPA decided not to prosecute them such a victim could bring uh a private prosecution so I'm not sure if she was directly referring to to Pao Pao because I I don't know if there would be um a person who would be able to say they have a direct interest in the matter in that case um and yeah so I think that private prosecution tions are an important part of our Criminal Justice System um and they they should remain uh that we have had instances where serious crimes have not been prosecuted by the NPA that have then been taken up privately um so I think it's an important Safeguard in in our system um but there is a danger that it could be used politically and I think that's probably what she was uh referring to yeah I want to just loop back on you know that element of uh then you know uh future proofing you know the the the um the NPA I mean what are the practical Solutions do you think that can help then build this um strong and independent NPA uh whilst at the same time effectively just restoring faith in the public and of course you know combating crime if possible yeah so there's some very clear measures that can be taken um the director General Justice is currently the accounting officer for the NPA that should change the accounting officer should be the ndpp herself or himself whoever we don't know who will be ndpp in 18 months time so we need we need that then we need the appointments process at the moment um the current ndpp was appointed through quite a good process instituted by the president the current president but that was voluntarily the president can appoint without following such a process and so we would hope to see in the legislation uh Provisions saying that uh that the sort of process that was followed um for her appointment would be followed for all future appointments then we have the provisions which require ministerial approval for certain things like getting in extra skills for certain matters we would hope that those would be removed and that the ndpp would have power firstly to make her own budget um and to to spend that budget then we have very interesting Provisions which um determine the salaries and and one of the big disasters during the state capture area was errors made in the occupational specific dispensation which was supposed to adjust prosecutor salaries to put them on the same level as in the private sector and this there were many mistakes made there and so the whole salary dispensation um needs to be looked at and then we need to have prosecution Le investigations like we had during the the Scorpions the the investigating directorate is a is a first step in that direction um but we need a lot more um steps in that direction and then when it comes to the directors of public prosecutions in in the divisions so we have one more division than provinces uh two divisions in King those are the people who take the day-to-day decisions on on Prosecuting or not Prosecuting extremely powerful currently they serve for until they're 65 so if someone has been appointed in their 40s they'll serve for a very long time and if they happen to have been the wrong decision it's not so easy um to get rid of them so like the ndpp has a a 10year term I would like to see that the that the dpps also have a more limited 10 years so that we can bring in new Talent um and and each you know and and follow a rigorous process of appointment and ensure that their tenure is completely secure um during that time when when they are DPP and of course it will be very tough and interesting at the same time 18 months then uh for shamila batoi as she tries to then solidify um all of those foundations and uh and plans in fact that she has built but thank you so much Dr Dr redpath for your analysis um and coming on to the program Dr Jean redpath from the dla Omar Institute
ATpz-_3KeHw,Two-Pot Withdrawals | Employers exposed for leaving with no pension funds: Maya Fisher-French,2024-10-15T14:09:49Z,1737,"the twoot system has exposed thousands of employers who have left workers with no Pension funds and other benefits because they have not contributed uh to the pension fund now some companies have been found to not have contributed to the pension fund as far back as 20 years ago these companies were exposed when people were allowed to access a portion of their Pension funds but found there was nothing in the pot well let's uh take this discussion further now on the twoot system and bring in personal finance columnist Maya Fisher French Maya thank you so much for your time and good afternoon to you so while many South Africans have benefited from this twoot system uh withdrawals there have been a number of red flags since its implementation uh last month you know as as more people continue to withdraw perhaps let's start with your insights and Reflections on this process um and and what it has signaled for you Maya I I think it has actually been a very interesting exercise Human Experience um on many levels uh one of them actually as you mentioned is I think a lot of people are now realizing that their details may not have been up to date with the pension fund uh their contact details weren't correct because a lot of obviously admin had to take place for people in order to make those withdrawals and those are good things that's really good that you know your your pension fund knows where to find you and you they've got your correct uh details I think on one level that's been quite a positive development and then again for these many people that um Sunny discovered their their pensions had not been paid and you know action can be taken now rather than they get to retirement um can you imagine getting to retirement and discovering that there was no pension waiting for you but I think um I was having a look at some of the numbers uh that we received from SARS um about the number of tax directives that have been applied for and it's about just over 1.2 million people not million people tax directives and that's very important 1.2 million tax directives but of course some people may be drawing more from more than one pension fund they may have a Company pension fund and a retirement imunity for example but that represents sort of less than 20% of of retirement fund members so so those are sort of numbers we looking at at the moment um that sort of 21 billion Rand um has been will be paid out based on those numbers but obviously we're expecting more withdrawals to come uh you know as as time passes how concerning is it that um especially you know in the first few days that many of those who withdrew from their funds were closer to retirement are we talking about 40 plus 50 plus um years here just a little uh a few years left in fact to retirement well we actually saw that most of the people who withdrew were it it it did range depending on um you know on on ages and but also income levels so we certainly saw lower income earners drawing on the money more than high income earners which makes sense those people are going to be under Financial pressure um but of course that is concerning that you're getting close to retirement you probably don't have enough money for retirement and yet you're accessing These funds and we certainly saw a high level of distress um in you know in in terms of of accessing the money I I've been writing a lot about the government employee pension fund which has not really started to pay out yet and many members are very very set about it um and the overwhelming message I was getting from Members was they need the money to pay debt they have you know bills to pay and they need the funds for that and I think that to me is very concerning it really revealed the state of households in South Africa in terms of their levels of indebtedness let's talk about those that did withdraw I mean given that there there is concern that those who chose to withdraw larger amounts Now find themselves on a higher tax bracket we know of course that that amount was was kept I mean how then do they balance pay more uh on tax while also trying to save enough for retirement yeah I think a lot of people were very shocked to discover that they were going to have to pay tax on this withdrawal um and I think a lot of people banked on the money and had kind of made plans with the money before they realized um they were going to get substantially less after tax was paid so that was certainly appeared to come as quite a shock to many people um and I think one of of the concerns of course is that when you make a withdrawal like that it's added to your taxable income so for some people they may actually find that it pushes them into another tax bracket um and and that may come as a bit of a nasty shock when they do their tax return in February because you know by then the you know it will be better understood I think part of the when when SARS does the calculation one is not sure if they've got it 100% correct um obviously it'll be balanced out in in the next tax returns as to whether there's any additional taxes to pay and that may also come as as another surprise and then of course there were many people who owed sar's money um and sar's used this opportunity to uh to get those back taxes from them um ma of course uh you know I want to go back to your earlier comment around those um employers who were found wanting I mean some haven't paid contributions or made contributions to their employees dating back 20 years you seemed rather optimistic that you know they have enough time to recover before you know uh retirement I mean how how confident are you then I mean for those that are watching and are concerned that you know when they inquired they actually have zero balance when they thought that the employer was actually contributing uh what do you have to say to them in terms of uh if they have you know 10 to 15 years before retirement well I'm not I'm not necessarily optimistic they're going to take all their money back I just think it's better to know now yeah um then discover at retirement this is this has also galvanized hopefully um the authorities to actually do something about it and what's very important actually is in 2023 so last year the FCA issued a report on this and they found more than 3,000 employers who who were four months or more behind on on payments um so you know we almost catching up on this information now people I think only really understanding the the consequences of that um and I I think what was also interesting for me in those statistics was many municipalities as we now know were involved in that these are actual government you know departments that were which is basically fraud when you take money from someone's salary and you don't invest it it's fraud um and I think what's very concerning is that the bulk of them were also secur in the security for um industry which is also very very worrying um but this is a criminal offense and you know this can go to court and directors can actually be held personally liable and in fact some municipalities in some provinces have also been taken to court um thank you so much Maya for your time really do appreciate it personal finance columnist Maya Fisher French"
NCcNiUOKYEM,"Tito Mboweni | Friends, comrades visit Mboweni home: Samkele Maseko",2024-10-15T14:08:26Z,19602,"let's take you to this now people are starting to arrive at the home of the late Reserve Bank Governor as well as Finance labor minister diten in Kilani in Johannesburg sabc news senior reporter Sam maso is there for us Sam good afternoon to you of course we've seen an overwhelming response and reaction to the death of Tito boeni with many South Africans including of course local and abroad people just remembering the and what he symbolized for this country just talk to us about what you're seeing at the moment indeed unti moners are coming to the residence of T here in Johannesburg I'm just going to move out of sh with M the spokesperson of the ANC as the arrival of the Secretary General of the ANC figa he has just arrived now uh to pay his condolences and a visit uh to the family home he will will be leading the ANC delegation with the provincial secretary the ANC head of organizing that would be Manana and also Tik the provincial secretary and sasaba M who is the regional Secretary of the ANC that would be the ANC leadership they are going in now we will just speak to M once she has ushered in the Secretary General of the African National Congress they are here to pay their respects for their departed ANC member former national executive committee member of the African National Congress Tito Titus moeni who was the youngest ever minister of Labor within the country he was appointed within that particular position at the age of 35 and the age of 39 he became the governor of The Reserve Bank of South Africa he always said that he was the eighth governor of the South African Reserve Bank it also comes at a time where he has Departed the land of the living where they were debating serious economic issues within the structures of thec such as the nationalization of the sou African Reserve Bank which is a point that he spoke very much against in saying that there's no need to change and to nationalize the African Reserve Bank as it is already owned by the government of South Africa in the sense that the government has more directors in The Reserve Bank and The Reserve Bank is the one that implements South Africa's fiscal policies and I mean Sam as we reflect of course on just some of the things that have been said about dieni I mean one comes to mind and that is the words by the current um you know Governor L kany saying that tieni had a beautiful policy mind and one of course remembers how he has always stood up for the independence of you know the the likes of The Reserve Bank as well as assar Etc just talk to me about just some of the reflections that have stood out for you over this past couple of days some of the reflections that have stood out come fromc ordinary members some PEC members particularly in the province of I'm reminded of a comment that was made by where he spoke about how his generation were not deployed or sent into government positions on the basis of their popularity within the structures of the AG see not based on patronage but based on the capabilities and the skills and the strengths that they had in saying that former president Nelson Mandela the founding president of our democracy sawo his caliber and capabilities when he was first deployed as the minister of Labor within the country you go to the comments that have been made by the former General Secretary of the Congress of the African trade unions that would be Mima on the history and the legacy of Tien and what he has assisted the lab Force within the country with with some of the policies they came up with when he was the minister of Labor within the country you go to the time when he was called upon to become the Minister of Finance when President s maposa took over the Reigns of power and how he had to balance some of the economic policies and Social Security Programs that the ANC had come up with particularly coming at a time where the government was faced with financial constraints where the economy was not GR growing and sou Africa's economy was very stagnant at the time you look at a time where he also went to play a role particularly you remember when he had left public office he was frequenting Kigali a a lot in Rwanda you look at the comments that come from the president of Rwanda president Paul kagam and well and and it just tells you of the stature of the man called Tito Titus Moen and also in his later years the LI the times he spent in his own village in Z in liopo where he grew up going to the school where he studied in Primary School engaging with ordinary residents of his particular community in tanin whether it be the rate payers Association whether it be the structures of the African National Congress or just representing the downtrodden and the POA you look at how political formations across the board have spoken so eloquently about one who comes to mind is Julius s malma the leader of the economic freedom fight saying that tieni was a representative of the people tieni respected their views whether they differ or not anden also was a person who embraced African leadership and I mean just as you reflect on just how a range of people that you've spoke to and of course our colleagues have spoken to everybody agrees in terms of the significant impact that he has made I also you know recall that the unions in fact also had high praises for him because you will recall of course that under his leadership the Labor Relations Act of 1995 as well as the basic conditions of Employment Act of 1997 were implemented in fact these are just some of the benefits that workers today are still you know uh flourishing under uh if one can put it that way but what are we expecting as we wrap up our conversation samele uh to happen this morning um this afternoon particularly as those as you've said ANC members are coming in uh from the family perspective in terms of Arrangements what can you tell us what we do know is particularly alluding to some of those Labor Relations acts that were signed and brought into law under the tenure of T it was those comments that came from the likes of Zin mavi who is a former General Secretary of KATU and also it would be Bazi mamila who was a general secretary of KATU as well who worked extensively with tieni when he was the minister of Labor particularly within the country what is happening now is that leaders of the African National Congress are coming to D's residents here in Johannesburg to pay homage to speak to the brother I saw Tito's brother going in to this particular residence of Tito M earlier on they will get an update from the family they will be providing an update to the family on the anc's program on the memorials of Tito going forth from now but I am going to bring in M the spokesperson of the African National Congress condolences to you as the African National Congress on the passing of your former n member former Minister former governor of The Reserve Bank just the processes uh going forth from now with the visit of the ANC delegation to the family uh to the residents of tieni here in Johannesburg yes um the leadership of thec led by the Secretary General together with the leadership of our Hing Province are here to condole with the family and to assure the family of the continued ANC support during this difficult time in any case this is an extended family thec being that to um our late comrade dieni just some of the programs that will unfold going forth from now until he is laid to his final resting place I would assume that would be as we've seen the communication this Saturday in n where he HS from yes this Saturday in z n in Mah where he also came from and where he resided for most of his time and um we look forward to joining and being joined by many other South Africans and not just ASC supporters andc members in um eulogizing the great son of um South Africa and the first black governor of The Reserve Bank who inspired many young people people who are growing up today and can look up to something that it is possible for a black child and for a black young woman and for a black young man to make it to um citadels of financial power such as um and monetary power such as a Reserve Bank so he stands as that mirror against which future Generations would look at themselves they of course me back to the logistics uh there will be an ongoing ER prayers there's a it has been done thec leadership are partaking in this our national National shapy are active in supporting the family led by Reverend C the chaplain General and they are also here as part of thec Delegation what are some of the funnest memories you can share about the Juke of makaba Cl as he was so affectionately known well I you know on a personal level there are so many um anecdotes I could share it's a Pity that I'm speaking in my capacity as a spokesperson of thec but I must say he's he's always been a big brother H I've had the privilege of really knowing him um you know intimately in terms of um a person who was a whole person in a sense that he had many other interests other than political interests he was really in touch with his soul and that manifested in him sitting down in Social conversations sharing stuff that had nothing to do with politics about life in general about things that get him warmed up and happy as a person so we we really have lost someone that was relatable someone that was affable someone that will discuss a lot with you even if you didn't share the same political values was always eager to reach out to as many South Africans as possible and I think he's known for that those that worked with him at treasury would tell you about what a Visionary he was and also How firm and decisive he was and I think the the leadership decisiveness that he displayed in his leadership roles is something and a sight to behold there are many other values that I could refer to where D boeni was concerned within thec of course as you know one of the early doans of uh um developing an economic governance architecture in our country contributed a lot in the ready to govern that um seminal document of the NC that was put out projecting a vision for a future democratic government including the economic policy was really right at the center and the thick of it alongside Trevor Manuel and many other comrades that started this journey that we have inherited thank you very much M I would want to raise a point but I'm not going to raise it now they called it the think tanks and the children of the man who stays just two streets away from this residence of T that would be former president isn't it quite simp it isn't quite interesting and a source of wonder in a in a sense that this is a represents a lot of Simplicity and I would hope the members of the media would also comment about the simple life he lived here in Kilani of course our own former president also is a resident of kiladi in Johannesburg indeed T did live a very simple life not lavish life at all I remember when he was the Minister of Finance he would never travel with the blue light Convoy as many have accustomed South African politicians to be he drove his own vehicle had no protectors with him even defied the president of the Republic of South Africa in many occasions when he said that Minister of Finance you cannot travel without protect but seemingly said no I will travel alone he also particularly when you look at the ministerial handbook When government scaled down on luxurious vehicles and put a cap on the amount that the ministers Mayors and members of the executive must spend on their executive Vehicles he kept it at about 700,000 to 800,000 Rand and cutting away with those expensive German machines that we would see on the roads such as those x5s and scaling down to the XTR within that particular range"
Yq7G8NRo6TA,Two-Pot Withdrawals | Dodgy employers exposed: Tshepo Mongoai,2024-10-15T13:14:32Z,2569,Let's uh take you to this now the twoot system has exposed thousands of employers who have left workers with no Pension funds and other benefits because they have not contributed to their pension fund now some companies have been found to not have contributed to the pension fund as far back as 20 years ago now these companies were exposed when people were allowed to access a portion of their Pension funds but found there was nothing in the pot let's take this discussion further now on the twoot system we have in studio our economics editor Teo M thank you so mucho for your time this afternoon so firstly let's take a step back I mean I remember about a month ago just days after the implementation of the twoot system we understood that retirement fund members have so far applied I think about 4.1 billion Rand at the time so where are we at at the moment how much has essentially been withdrawn well uh um the figures that has been released uh and it's been made available we we hear it's about 21 billion Rand um it will probably go higher um SARS had indicated that they probably will generate uh in the region of about 5 billion rent and of course um I think annually on average they um taxes that are paid from pension withdrawal average 12 billion rent so it's not quite quite significant um in the grand scheme of things in terms of how much SAS must actually raise in in Revenue because um they need much much much more and of course it adds to the Kitty uh and and in yesterday of course we expecting in fact today we were expecting that the financial sector conduct Authority was going to table a kind of a preliminary report an update on the two-port system it was very very important for us to get a sense of uh the issues and and I'm sure there are quite a lot of uh challenges that this has Unearthed uh not to say that um regulators and and those in power were not aware of this of this problem um it's just that there has not been decisiveness in dealing with this yes the the the objectives and the plans of of the two-port system uh make sense in terms of protecting uh people but you also have um this issue of nonpayment of of pension fund and and I want to go to those you know hurdles that this system has has um um uncovered but but I also want to then go back to the positives because those that have withdrawn it was for a very good reason in the fact that South Africans were really feeling the pinch but just the the fact that some companies had not been contributing to the retirement uh system for many employees uh some dating back as 20 years uh we know of course that several municipalities have been taken to court um in the northern Cape um just talk to us about what are those challenges that you know this process has uncovered well the reality is U you have uh companies uh including to a large extent municipalities that often experience cash flow challenges um as an employer you are supposed to make a contribution as as as you would know and and because of that they've not been able to do that now you have trustees and principal officers yeah who sits at the helm of this uh pension fund or administrators who are looking at this and who have a fiduciary responsibility uh to protect the the workers they are not working for these companies they are supposed to be independent and they must ensure that those uh pension uh schemes are sustainable and are managed properly and the employers pay their dues but they they've not been doing that uh and and there and you also get a bit of resistance from some trustees who are arguing that look if I have uh 20 companies uh how do I ensure that and fight them and and you know I don't have capacity to do that uh but the the pension fund adjudicator is saying you see these matters are becoming complex and it's more and more the fsca is saying we're going to name and shame them yeah uh but you you you get a sense that there is no decisiveness even politically of dealing with this particular issue and say we need to arrest this because the same issue we are trying to address through the two-port system where we preserve this pension fund there's actually nothing to preserve so these people will remain dependent on the state and I mean it just um boggles the mind in as far as um why then open this up if there was some sense of hint you know that this could be the problem what then happens to those that are desperately in need of you know these funds because if you recall before you know the the twoot system was it was because of how the state of the economy in this country is and because of high levels of you know food prices and just Cost of Living was at an astronomical level also when you factor in um the issues of unemployment so what now for for those that desperately needed this money it's going to be a challenge and I think um there was uh the the the way the tort came about the pension fund did not preempt this uh that there will be this uh withdrawal at at a bigger scale and and how some of uh this fund have been managing it is that they if someone is in areas and the employer has not paying uh they will prioritize that and ensure that they start engaging with the employer to say remember this person in 3 years is going on on on on retirement so please find money and make sure this person is up to date and then the employer will settle the areas so that when the person retire they're able to get their dues but they will also be defaulting on a number of members so now when you have almost everyone claiming at the same time it start to expose those deficiencies in the system uh and and I suppose because it did the the trustees were aware but it was managed uh they did not uh have the will to to deal with it as they should have now have unions also um you know lambasting this process in as far as just what is paid out ultimately to the members you have Union saying s is taking a cut um administrators are also wanting now to impose their fees what then um are essentially the problems that the unions are having and do you think they will then be met you know halfway given the fact that this two-pot system is something that is here to stay I think um the argument of of the Union it's actually falling flat I mean they they were part of these deliberations for quite some times and I think at times you almost get a sense that they are speaking to the gallery and just to seem to be doing something about it uh but there's also another question uh unions are supposed to be vocal on these particular issues I I mean one wonders if they really you know being vocal in in in raising these particular issues taking to the street and and and confronting those uh I mean the FCA has been naming some of these employers but what did the unions do uh about it uh have they really really been active in ensuring that they deal with it at every level that they can H and and I doubt if if if they have been doing that and and one wonders uh why aren't they doing that uh is it simply because when people retire perhaps they don't contribute their dues I mean they they take to the streets in ensuring that the base their base in terms of contribution subscription grows when the demand that jobs must be created all right but there are a lot of people are there vulnerable yeah uh tppa thank you so much for that of course we'll continue then to focus on this particular story that was our economics editor for

RjEHbTzNxZE,Lukhona Mnguni weighs in political developments in the country,2024-10-15T13:09:28Z,3648,all right to speak more on this and other political stories let's now welcome political analyst luk Muni luk thank you so much for your time and of course good afternoon to you perhaps before we speak about the accusations leveled against Baza Sufi and they are a lot I want to get your sense then on the anc's reflections of the government of national Unity yesterday I mean we heard from president s rapasa essentially saying that people should judge the gnu based on its work and not necessarily on political parties there was of course that big question with the sacp snubbing seemingly the 100 days reflection of the gnu just your observations well onati a very good afternoon and a good afternoon to your viewers I suppose yesterday was an interesting event as you say president ramapa made mention that he's not celebrating the gnu uh but he's actually H you know uh reflecting on the 100 days of this government National Unity which is inclusive of 10 political parties and I think that for thec it's also important for them to have a political program outside of the government of national Unity natural fact I've been reflecting with some uh you know friends and academics to say that it's important for politicians and political parties to avoid what we term dilution so being diluted by participating in the government of national Unity as the president I think uh you know emphasized that the successes of the gnu H will be the successes of the gnu and not necessarily just of one political party over the other but he made mention and was actually quite robust to say that the political program of thec has embodied in its Manifesto is now the political program of the government of national Unity I think there was a bit of an overstretch um in so far as that is a lot of wishful thinking in my belief because we do know that there are actually some schisms uh that exist between the two major political parties to this you know Grand Coalition or thec and the da there are a number of issues where they disagree he made mention of two which is the Bella Act and the nhi ACT but there are other fundamental societal outlooks where these parties differ for example around questions of labor laws we know that for the da often laments the labor laws of this country as causing you know a disincentive for investors into the economy and therefore economic growth thec definitely does not agree with that particularly no doubt at the time of the passing of the first minister of Labor Tien so I I think un it was an interesting event H but probably more politics rather than substance yeah let's now get into the Crux of the matter of course the da taking its fight now into provincial level in hting I mean the premier of hen and also ANC chair pyaza Lui facing credibility attacks it would seem from the da Freedom front plus and afre forum and they now also calling on President Raposa to act you know as these tensions are also spoing over on tox platform I mean what do you then make of these developments especially sincec Secretary General fil balula and Lui have also been at loggerheads over the gnu specifically and I mean we've just heard now from soim simang saying that 58 forensic reports are yet to be essentially you know um uh well while Paz Lui is yet to then just release these reports but what do you then make of these um political squabbles are they political squabbles or is uh you know paza lui's credibility on the line here well I think in the first instance the da in howang is quite flat-footed and is trying to find political relevance and reimagine itself and re-image itself as you know the official opposition in the province of Ken remember they've been waiting on the sidelines unwilling to upset the apple cart as it were because they were probably hopeful they would at some point eventually be part of the government of uh the Coalition in King and it seems that you know that ship has sailed particularly if you see uh and listen to the remarks made by the deputy president of thec yesterday in the buildup of that reflection of of the G of of the 100 days of gnu unti when Paul mashati made mention that you know if the da doesn't cooperate in Kang then pazza and the ANC must go ahead and they wish that the problems of Kang do not become the problems of the government nationally because nationally they are working quite all right so I do find that the da in Ken probably feels somewhat isolated left behind by events and therefore needs to catch up because as you are saying some of the reports that they are talking about if you listen to the timelines 2016 to date are timelines that would have occurred under the leadership of you know before even B Al sui but one may want to ask a different question H during the negotiations what was the da posture to thec about these reports in making sure that as they come into the Kang provincial government they would not be tainted by being part of an establishment that sits on this kind of reports that they make mention to you know be hiding corruption and involving Bazi in corruption we do know particularly during covid-19 when the now Premier was the then M of Education there were a number of shenanigans and issues that did come up that needed and you know ought to have been thoroughly investigated and it would be important to go back to that era and see how far things have come but you also talk about how much of a headache is this for thec I think for thec there seems to be a developing consensus that um you know whatever is happening in Ken will not affect the national government and the leadership of President Raposa and it may well be that what is happening in Kang is actually becoming what I call the first sign post of the road map towards 2027 December Conference of thec where some grouping of people will coal as around the posture of the AMC in hen to buy themselves Insurance h know from the narratives of the gnu and working with the da or resisting working with the da and banazi is emerging along with solima piler of the sap probably as the poles of Attraction for these anti- gnu forces and sentiments what is important about bazza as detailed by balula in one of his press briefings yesterday is that bazza is actually you know a a leader um of of thec and so it's a bit different for him so is too disagreeable to a point that he might be breaking the code of conduct of thec it may well invite the Wrath of the leadership of thec for him to be disciplined so I suppose internally there's going to be some indications of the political direction towards the inheritance of the political leadership of thec because come 2027 December we know that thec will have a new president and just on that last point I mean I'm glad you mentioned of course the road map to that elective conference uh yesterday also the deputy president you know Paul masad of thec of course seemed to sidestep questions about you know the succession in thec calling the debate about who will succeed you know s rapos premature at the stage I mean when you consider as you rightfully said that 2027 is actually not that far off I mean these shenanigans that we are seeing um as as some have called it how will they then play out in 2027 and will they be the deal breaker in as far as where thec chooses to go now uh with the gnu well look unti I think for any sensible politician in thec they would know exactly how vulnerable the party is I mean it has just lost an election for the first time since 1994 and um the you know the government of national Unity quote unquote is gaining enough traction uh within so society and in some spaces and they are really doing well in terms of their PR of selling this as the best uh formula that could have happened post the 29 May elections it would then be very premature to Overlay that success or or that traction that they are gaining in government with squabbles uh within thec in actual fact it probably would be best for thec to postpone any of these ractions playing out in the public domain as much as possible which is why I've even you know in some instances H posited that it may well even be you know ill advised for thec to go to a national general Council next year which some people are hoping that they will use as some did in 205 as a precursor to the National Conference to fight internal squabbles and of course uh becoming more inward looking rather than looking at the broader picture and I think that an ANC that can manage its internal affairs has appear to be coherent and managing succession much more soberly than it has done in the past is what will probably make some of its supporters regain confidence in the ANC but an ANC that you know eats itself alive in the public domain with people pulling in different directions because they are solving for their own self-interest rather than the broader good of the organization I think that will be ANC In Perpetual Decline and I mean I just want to sneak this one last question in luk in as far as other parties that are not necessarily within the gnu looking at you know how they're reacting to what we are seeing today I mean we heard uh action sa saying that all it needs is accountability because as it stands the gnu can't provide that because as you rightfully also put it they are all about self-service and not necessarily looking after the interests of the country but what are their strategies at the moment as they are looking look at these developments I I think that a number of political parties that are outside the GN you save for those with a larger voice like party and to an extent the economic freedom fighters but the remainder of the parties actions say acdp and ATM uat and so on and I think they've got a mammoth battle for survival in their own hands because what the gnu does unti in my view and I've been consistent at this is that it creates what I term politics of visibility and invisibility so if you're not in the gnu you are actually becoming invisible particularly in the discourse of national politics because H you now have 10 political parties that are playing prominent roles either as ministers Deputy ministers and chairpersons of significant portfolio committees in Parliament whereas your party has nothing and I think it's for this reason that a party like actiona realized that whilst it might play this self-righteous you know know a role at a national level it does inting where its core base of support remains uh need to play its hand even much more and that's why they've got a speaker in the city of Johannesburg and now an executive mayor in the city of Tuan so you might want to ask yourself then unti um how much of that opposition to the gnu really is material or is Optics in an instance where actions say needed to be voted into office by thec both in the city of Johannesburg and in the city of Tuan Lor thank you so much for your time a pleasure to have you on the show luk Muni is a political analyst of course just weighing in on what we are seeing on the political front
uJme1F7S79c,KZN provincial govt launches planting season,2024-10-15T13:04:52Z,612,guul natal provincial government has today launched the planting season campaign this is aimed at addressing

you so much for your time perhaps let's start at the beginning the importance of today's program thank you I I think the importance of today's program is that after the research councils H report we we prioritize the district that were um identified then and then we have program different programs that are going to be used in those different um um District uh but all those program will be looking at how do we then assist the people to have the stable food to have because there was also issue of poverty issue of unemployment hunger and obesity but we then said let's go toing and then here the people they are saying they like they are seeing God coming to them today they've never been visited this portion inos said we we we we we we are blessed today because we are here but we are saying why why then do we chose this place we chose it because it it it is having two WS is a a a a rural area the research is saying in the inyama trust area they have vast land that is un used then we're answering to that because while we're campaigning we're saying trust us and then we're saying you trusted us and we're here and also what what is happening here is that everyone is accommodated because in the government of national Unity we're now looking at the problem first regardless of a party affiliation and that is why people are so excited so happy that we are here and we are going going to be ER assisting 50 uh communities 50 and then we have 31 female 19 male and then when you look at that ratio we have accommodated disabled youth especially women and I'm excited M let's perhaps talk about those problems that you you've highlighted the issue of drought in the province of quazo natal is quite a serious one a number of districts have report this as a concerning Factor when it comes to the issue of obviously planting or farming what are you doing in those specific areas that are experiencing drought in was in in the areas where they are experiencing drought sometimes we build B we put Boles sometimes we build some dams sometimes because the when you go to the don't do it according to your thinking you go to the PE people and then you have because agriculture is science anyway we have our our scientist that they will look at the area and then they will tell you this area the soil if you do you plant this this crop is going to thrive during this month and that is what we're doing and that's what we're following and also I've said we are not just doing for the sake of doing it we will be coming back here to to look at the the progress report and and we are having H MEC for for EA for economic and we're also having our own Wing that is responsible for IM marketing then then then then these people are going to be looked after well from the Department of course the uh report which was released by the human Sciences research council did indicate uh that a number of communities have now chosen to basically abandon this way of love of life which is farming you know uh in a number of Rural uh communities what are as the department are you doing to ensure that you close that Gap to ensure that you encourage people and you make all the resources available to them in order for them to to embark on that um I'm proud to tell you that in each and every District people are now up and they are honoring my call because I've made a clar on call to say let us make the K it and to be green let's all go out the unfortunate part will be the resources but the resources that I have will be used solely for assisting our people and I'm proud to say that because each and every corner go up the mountain you go to the Tav you will hear them saying ah agriculture is say let's go out and work before we let you go M MEC uh on a day like this sometimes government would come come and launch this uh particular program but the monitoring of the program itself how are you going to ensure that as you bring these resources they are utilized for the purposes which you you you you want them to be even we we we are having some systems in place I will be physically visiting some of the projects we will be doing an announced visit because we are sick and tired of coming here promising people when you leave and then you'll hear people saying but when you left everything disappear we are going to make sure that we are here and we are I've said we'll be making I will be having a portion when we're doing strategic plan to say I having a directorate that is will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation of whatever activity we are doing so that I'm sure and it's not going to be under the office of the the h will be responsible for that directory so that I don't want the program to tallish my name and my image and my organization image thank you so much for your time thank you there is the MC responsible for agriculture here in the province of guazu natal basically saying that the department will embark on a process of ensuring that when such programs are launched in the Pro in the province there is strong monitoring of what would have been expected to be done in those particular programs

FSC6bzWuFfY,Tito Mboweni | Bankuna High School principal Mynnah Mohlaba remembers Mboweni,2024-10-15T12:05:10Z,6037,I can tell you that indeed the news of the passing on of the former Finance Minister tieni has sh has sent the shock waves to the community of nanga where he comes from and we visited the family yesterday and today we continue to reflect on his you know because understand that he did you know Primary School um at a a village called BAU and then he went on to do his high school um you know studies at a school called banun high school here inanga currently we are actually at this very same school where he did uh his you know um high school studies and I'm now joined here by the school principal the current principal of this school Min maaba who is currently the principal here and we want to reflect on some of you know um the legacy of and let's talk about we understand that he was one of the Learners in this very same school and I understand it was back then around 1970s what can we what can you tell us abouten as a Learner in this this very same school thank you and thank you to the viewers as a principal the current principal of banun high it also shocked us as a banun family we woke up on the TW on the 12th of that was Sunday uh about the passing of the giant Tien I quickly came in the morning at the school and checked on the archives about him as a learner at banun and I found that he was a learner here at banun he was the learner of the Class of 1978 and then as I go further checking on the archives I find that he was the brightest larner as I checked on all the schedules that they did during his term at bouna and he was also a science student where he obtained a lot of marks which made him in all the the gra that he was at banun being a number one learner so we are saddened about his passing but he was one of the giant which made banun to have the name the mighty banun and then we we understand that he also played a role in in the politics of this um country and you know him as an activist maybe just take us through what you remember about him back in the 1970s during the era of apar thank you again as an activist I was still young because I'm younger by some years six or seven years than him but we heard that he was an activist one of the people who fought with the apartate regime who are where we are now because of one of his his him and his M who made it possible while we were still while I was still talking about this while we were still young at a primary school we just had him and others they were called terrorist by the former regime and we didn't know about it until we we heard that they are not terrorists but they were just fixing what was wrong about our country and we understand that this man was also you know a a Visionary a community leader um and he played a very significant role particularly uh at The Reserve Bank and when he was the minister of Labor during the president Mandela's era what what what what do you remember about him and what are some of the Legacy that we really going to remember him about the Legacy that we remember Tito about there are many student or many people who are learned now because they emulated this men they knew that education will really bring the the the country back will take it back from the the apartate H um I can say that ER the village where he's coming from there are so many people who now are at the high ranks of the Department of Education at all the Departments and also our leaders in the country I can say Tito Moen was one of the greatest leader that will never forget H in one instance I was joyful talking with h some of my my colleagues or the student whom were together at the University I told them that I was bragging that we have one in the Tonga Community who is signing the the the no the bank notes and if he get tired he will just relax and don't sign and will go to the bank and don't get money that was one of the things which made many of us to be proud of him and then what are the Learners here saying you know you know being studying at the very same school where the giant like you know um start understand that he also started here so what are the Learners saying and what message is this you know bringing to the to the young people who wants to be you know uh most important people in future thank you uh the Learners are so

passing but indeed he's living quite you know a rich Legacy to the people of Banga high school and the surrounding uh villages
hyXz2zscq7w,SARS target VAT system overhaul by 2028 - Shannon Friedman shares thoughts,2024-10-15T12:00:28Z,785,the South African Revenue Service has opened up discussions around the modernization of the country's value added tax system and it set 2028 as a Target year for companies to have their systems in place to be able to comply with the pending changes modernizing the V8 return system will involve a move to e invoicing which is said to have already begun in countries like Brazil Chile and India as well as economic blocks like the European Union well to discuss these matters further I'm joined by Freedman she's the CEO of vat modernization South Africa thank you very much Shannon for joining us so why is it so important for South Africa to be working on the overhauling of the vat return system when it comes to be modernization basically there's it's in response to a a problem that's faed not just actually by SARS or South Africa and on the Zone but really the world and other countries where um there's bad framework in place really that problem what it's in response to is the significant amount of back leakage the system is exposed to despite the fact that that makes us the second highest contributor of revenue for um Revenue Services and we're not talking Small Change here either we're talking billions of Rand being lost each year due to the fact that that time and time again goes under reported either due to inaccuracies or data quality issues you know that all add up along the way or also fraud as well yeah and the reason for all of this is because by nature of the death return framework you reporting V on a periodic basis at a very highly summarized level now what that means is there's a lot of space for things to be hidden or for things to go unreported because they're hiding in those Aggregates Now by moving to something like that modernization and the invoicing what you're essentially doing is rather than reporting that on the summarized basis you require companies to be transmitting their underlying transaction data so their invoices their credit notes Etc and by having start having access to the actual underlying data what that means is the whole supply chain becomes a lot more visible from everyone's perspective and you're actually seeing what these transactions are made out of making it much more easier for SS system to detect things like irregularities certain inputs don't have a matching output associated with it and stuff like that yeah Shannon let me come in there and Link in what you've just said you know so part of the process of achieving this modernized vat return system is for companies to do what's called Ein invoicing what does that involve and tell us about how then that they would share that with SARS okay perfect so it probably is good to start off by just distinguishing what an e invoice is and how it differs from how most businesses in South Africa are currently doing their invoices so essentially what an e invoice is it's a digital invoice in a machine readable or database format so that differs from um normal PDF or visual based invoices which while I exchang the electronically it requires a pair of eyes to capture or interpret that data now by switching over to something like e invoicing businesses are all transacting or communicating with each other in data format and that underlying data can then get transmitted to SARS and because it's in the database format SARS assistants are able to automatically process that verify that they might want to cross check a certain input against an output you have all those data fields available and what the beauty is about something like the vat system is that for every input or every output there's a corresponding or Contra transaction which puts a nice check in place to make sure everything either balances or that the transactions or balance are in place so is this a win-win for both the taxpayer and for SARS it most certainly is okay so obviously there's the obvious benefit of SARS being able to increase its back revenues close its back collection Gap uh from a compliance perspective there's also a very great benefit to businesses themselves just from the fact that compliant businesses are going to have a much more aut at way of doing their V returns or submitting their data to S as well as having um less issues when it comes to the vat assessment process such as less delays when it comes to um getting back refunds or not being as uh being having to face unnecessary audits another benefit that businesses will face when adopting e invoicing is not only actually from the compliance perspective but actually from an operations or business perspective as well when you move away from visual uh document formats to more database formats it opens up a lot of opportunities in the form of automation greater process visibility and that has a lot of um effects down the line as well through enhanced CRM procedures where basically people because businesses are transacting with data those documents are getting uh captured automatically instead of manually it also leads to Greater cash flow systems just due to the fact that documents are being managed better and managed more efficiently allows businesses to pay their creditors as well as it for them to receive from their debtors more on time and more quickly
Z3sIX8LJAaY,Markets Update | 15 October 2024,2024-10-15T11:57:12Z,270,"onto markets news now Asian stocks were mixed with Japan Australia and Taiwan making gains on the day but Hong Kong and China saw substantial declines as investors nervously await more detail in terms of stimulus for the Chinese economy the Nik share average Rose by 0.77% the hangang index declined by 3.67% while the Shanghai Composite Index fell by 2 and a half% us markets continued on their winning streak yesterday with all three major gauges ending the session in positive territory this was driven by high expectations around the third quarter earning season Tech firms performed particularly well on the day with the likes of Apple up over 1% and Nvidia up 2.4% meanwhile the US dollar continued to strengthen as Market players anticipate that the FED may not cut rates as aggressively as previously thought the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up nearly half a percent the S&P 500 gained 0.77% while the NASDAQ Composite Rose by 0.87% the Rand is trading at 1761 against the US dollar 2304 Visa the British pound and 1920 against the Euro the JSC uh is trading weaker today with the AA index falling 1% to 85,681 per ounce while the price of Brent crude oil is trading at $73 76 cents a barrel well to unpack the markets for us I'm joined by Martin Smith he's a portfolio manager at anchor capital thank you very much Martin for joining us so what's driving the market and why is there feeling that the FED won't be as aggressive in cutting rates as previously thought so I think what you've seen from Global markets is or specifically out of the US is it just continues to grind higher from here and I think it's on the back of a of a better economic backdrop and I think the market likes that but I think there's also still a little bit of cautiousness around got an upcoming election youve obviously got macro data coming out kind of every week around inflation and interest rates and growth and then you've obviously also got the geopolitics that's also still kind of up in the air so the market is grinding higher but still a little bit cautious and in so far as what the the FED are going to do it seemed like there was maybe a chance for 50 basis points Cuts about a week and a half ago but then we saw the jobs numbers that have kind of pushed that down to 25 basis points being the number that's probably going to come through um if any there's about a 90% chance or the Market's pricing about a 90% chance of a 25 basis points cut now November and the 50 basis points cut is no longer there yeah so what's your take on the local currency how that's performing we know that the US dollar is a bit stronger so that would have an effect on Emerging Market currencies like the Rand and also our local stock market you're 100% right there it's the the stronger dollar that's that's driving the kind of exchange rate at the moment and on the back of what I just mentioned now with the FED more likely they're not doing 25 basis points as opposed to half a percent it shows up in a stronger dollar which obviously kind of impacts our our Rand dollar exchange rates even though things are looking a lot better and more positive from African risk appetite perspective um in so far as our local markets um we've obviously done very well in the last few months but we've seen a little bit of an unwind of the Chinese trade that we've seen in the last couple of weeks start to play out bit of profit taking So that obviously affects things like our resource stocks and N bass and process and so we've seen a little bit of weakness in those shares and that's obviously filtering through into the kind of overall JSC index so the IMF has warned that total public Deb Deb is set to exceed $100 trillion us this year for the first time seeing Global debt uh reaching 93% of global GDP ultimately hitting 100% by 2030 I mean these are crazy numbers and it seems they're being driven largely by the United States and China but from a Market's perspective what are the possible implications of this you're 100% right it's it's the Chinese um story and the US story and the US has is higher than it kind of historically has been and I think um if we look at these numbers it's it's much higher than than average um and it's increasing but I think if you look at what the Market's seeing um it's that for now it seems sustainable it obviously can't continue at this rate because there will be longterm implications but it is quite a long long long way away for now it seems sustainable but again it needs to be curved kind of in the years that continue from here so for now the Market's not overly concerned but definitely something to to kind of keep IR on the horizon yeah so looking at a company stock uh apart from the market fundamentals which have currently been poor How concerned are you about sib Stillwater being compelled to pay damages of 21 billion Rand for rening on a Brazilian nickel and copper mine deal how badly will this affect them this was a decision of course that was taken at a London High Court earlier so I mean if you look at where pgms are at the moment um Sab is kind of burning through through cash at these levels so obviously not great for them at this kind of current point on the cycle um if they do have to that obviously it's going to put them in a bit of a tricky position but we'll obviously need to assess that when when it kind of comes through and the numbers come through but again yeah need to need to keep an eye on it but um again at these PGM prices it's it is definitely a bit bit of a concern for them all right we're going to leave it there Martin thank you so much for your your time and insights as always Martin Smith he's a portfolio manager at anchor Capital the organization of the petroleum exporting countries also known as OPEC says it's lowered its predictions for Global oil demand growth for this year and next year this is the third month in a row that OPEC has made these downward adjustments in its October oil market report it estimated that Global oil demand will grow by 1.93 million barrels per day in 2024 this is a decrease from the 2.3 million barrels per day growth predicted last month even with the third consecutive downgrade OPEC has stated that this year's Global oil demand growth is still well above the historical average seen before the pandemic the organization has reduced its estimate for Global oil demand growth in 2025 to 1.64 million barrels per day from down from a previous estimate OPEC lowered its forecast for Global oil demand growth in 2024 in 2025 in its monthly reports for August and September until August OPEC had kept its predictions of 2.25 million barrels per day for this year and 1.85 million barrels per day for next year which were first made in July last year last month eight OPEC plus countries extended their voluntary oil production Cuts until November and will begin to gradually reduce these cuts from December for"
pBtTCqL3Uhs,Marking International Cyber Awareness month with Gareth Cremen,2024-10-15T11:39:57Z,270,"October marks International cyber awareness month and for good reason too the mimar 2023 state of email security report showed that South Africa ranked sixth on the list of countries most affected by cyber crime while interpol's African cyber threat assessment report of 2022 revealed that a total of 230 million cyber threats were detected in South Africa with 95% of those taking place through email well to tell us how how we can better mitigate against cyber criminals and more I'm joined by Gareth kreman he's a cyber security legal specialist thank you very much for joining us Gareth so being a high-tech African country that South Africa is is um it seems as though the country does get quite hard hit with these cyber attacks uh typically what are you know devices or systems being hacked for what information are these criminal elements trying to get hold of good afternoon so let's start quickly by talking about the top five uh sectors in the top five cyber risks firstly um directly there so the first instance you have is ransomware and typically that's a form of malware that attempts to encrypt or scramble data typically of companies and organizations and then the criminals or cyber criminals would then use the encryption of the data as a means in that to extort money from the company in order to release it or unscramble the data so it's usually is an extortion method in the case of ransomware typically over there it comes down to staff awareness staff training human era will always slip in and and you know education is not a once off tick boox exercise it's continuous training of employees inside of organizations of what to look out for in particular unsolicited emails links in unsolicited emails and emails that look legitimate um there is various malware protection that parties can install so you can install and maintain very good antivirus or malware protection software inside of organizations um software updates are very much important to keep your applications up to dat and then you must look at data backups data backups are an integral part assuming you are the subject of ransomware and we've seen it in South Africa with a number of multinationals that are present here where their systems have been shut down and organizations cannot trade for weeks on end what is the ripple effect of that to your company at what point in time do you become financially distressed because of inability to trade uh and and to carry the cost of employees Etc and on going operating costs inside the company whereas if you have ongoing backups inside the company how often do companies check their backup data and frequently go back and see if I'm held to the subject of ransomware I can plug in my hard drive back up and I'm up and running within a few minutes that run somewhere they can keep you're not interested about it at all so that's the first one the second one we look at in terms of a cyber risk is what is known as fishing and fishing is where parties attempt to gain sensitive information while posing as a trustworthy contact for example you will receive an SMS seemingly from your bank um and typically what will happen then it will be followed up by a phone call with someone reporting to be your banker and they'll say to you that your account is being hacked whichever the case may be um and there's unscrupulous transactions and there's an OTP sent to your phone please can you hand it over and they already have some information from you and typically those are targeted attempts and before you know it you've given away your banking information they've logged into your bank account and they've teamed the account it's a common occurrence other attempts at fishing that we've seen in South Africa is where parties try to replicate or to mimic being a CEO or a CFO of a company and WhatsApp messages start coming through saying please can you transfer 50,000 Rand I urgently need it and they hold themselves out to being someone else but obviously there no people within the organization um and who to Target so an important aspect is companies must put protection and measures in place to protect the identity and the information of the CEO CFO or other relevant stakeholders inside the business employee training is important in terms of protocols for procedures to be followed if payments are to be made if emails are unexpected or unsolicited or appear to be suspicious reported to your RT team again make use of you know your malware software anti- maware software um and put your spam filters on inside of the organizations the third cyber risk we've always looked at and it's always been the one that was the Forefront of man and that is typically hacking we've always thought of hacking as being a very sophisticated matter where someone sits behind a computer and they constantly try break into your firewalls obtain uh all of your dialing or your loging credentials and details and it is still a common occurrence and typically the the criminals today are quite sophisticated in that they still utilize mechanisms of fishing you know spoofing links Etc that employees click on um and it's an important one because the question you need to ask is what is the value of the data that they collect and what is it worth we've seen internationally social media companies they built on social on on personal data and personal data is hugely valuable in the right hands um and to many people as well as to cyber criminals so from a hacking perspective you need to look at the primary methods in order to protect yourself what are the firewalls that you have in place for your networks what is the data access security that you currently have in place what are the procedures for removing access of an employee when they leave your organization and when we talk about a hacking perspective we've seen instances and take for example your local coffee shop you can go to your local coffee shop and you'll see a business person sitting there and having coffee at some point in time they'll get up they'll leave their cell phone on the table and their laptop and quickly go to the water closet or whichever the case may be and their laptop is unattended all they dialing into Wi-Fi that's not their own local Wi-Fi through their own dongle they're utilizing public Wi-Fi these are all means in that which create further threats in terms of possible data leaks Al together yeah I wanted to just come in there of course you're listing all the various ways that we can be um invaded so to speak but what I wanted to ask you is what can people do what can individuals and businesses do to guard against that you've talked a lot about ensuring that your systems are in place that suggest to me you know having skilled people but if you're talking about smmes or medium Enterprises sometimes the cost Factor may be an issue so what can you basically do to ensure that you can guard against it so if we take it a step back you identify the risks from a sber risk perspective and if you say these are the risks that we're exposed to your safeguarding mechanism becomes easier because you're going to say from a potential hacking perspective I know I need to get network firewalls in place these need not be very costly processes and that internally procedures should be written even for small medium Enterprises over there and ongoing education and team training for your employees in terms of what to look out for human error is a common occurrence it happens frequently an important aspect even for small medium Enterprises is to employ the services of a penetration tester there's a number of good penetration testers it's not a very expensive exercise but employ them at some point in time to identify and to see if they can penetrate the firewalls on your system it's really worth gold at the end of the day versus potential downtop um over there in terms of even information in terms of how you keep it data backups are important how frequently do you backup your data and your servers and that even if you're a small small medium Enterprise there are a number of solutions available publicly and there are good software systems for companies that are also relatively inexpensive and it is a worthwhile one for corporations and that to safeguard themselves identify the risks and to put the relevant means and mechanisms in place yeah so garyth when it comes to Insurance what are you insuring for are you insuring for the impact of the infiltration because obviously once somebody or you once somebody has hacked you and taken your information that's gone I mean you can't do you can't get that back and it can then be used for you know misdeeds so what exactly would you be insuring for look you you would have to take out cyber insurance it's a necessity I think in today's day and age and given the risks that South Africa faces in terms of the Global Spectrum um and ever increasing you know sber attacks in South Africa I would tell you to take out sber insurance to cover you for all aspects of sber risks generally um and it take out the relevant policies with the appropriate insurer now absent all of this where does it leave you into terms of vulnerability and exposure because if you don't have cyber Insurance where are you left to and where are your means to recover what has been lost or what has gone out into the into the domain generally there's operating losses that you are going to suffer during that period in time so insurance is becoming a necessity and a lot of consumers and corporates smmes it's something they should be looking at and it should be the Forefront of Mind especially when trading in in the marketplace e"
4sTCnnWsTdU,South African Auto Week 2024 celebrates Automotive Heritage,2024-10-15T11:38:16Z,387,"South Africa's automobile industry continues to evolve as it celebrates 100 Years of its existence there is a gathering in Cape Town right now of Industry players and my colleague diabo Sito is there we lost her earlier very good afternoon diabo sorry we lost you earlier but uh do proceed with your interview thank you so much N I am still in conversation with Mr bil Tom who's the president of namsa and he had just been talking to us about what we can expect this week conference Anders yeah what what I was saying is is automotive and we take this where we spend time talking about industry issues this year what's important about it we celebrating 100 years of existence and we'll be reflecting on the 100 years I think as you've said before around us we surrounded with vehicles that have been producing the country some are as old as 60 we've got the first vehicle that was imported into South Africa over 100 years ago in in one of the manufacturer stand in fact it's a Mercedes-Benz car and we also expect to be interacting with government as well because what's important for us is that policy s if you look at the growth of this industry in the last 30 years it grew because of the government policy because we put policies in place and in the process we exported just under 6 million cars with a revenue of 1.7 trillion R and what we want to do is to also continue we don't want this industry now to collapse but we want to grow the industry and um there's new challenges there's new transition I mean we transitioning into new energy Vehicles what is it that we need to do as a country what is it that the consumers want so there's a lot of discussions we having and also I mean we're going to be focusing on our key Focus areas key Focus areas and ensure that you know we we take the industry forward yeah at a time obviously at this time sentiment is improving we see interest rates are declining the Rand is doing slow so much better the petrol prices is doing better but things have not always been like this for the majority of the time things were quite depressed what kind of Trends did you notice in terms of consumer behavior and their buying patterns of vehicles during that time and do you expect a significant change as things change on the economic front so what what we predicted this year was a year of two halves we predicted the first half to be a very taxing first half because of what we went through last year I mean the ports delays the high interest rates and um the the electricity issues we had and it lived up to that the second half we see a slight Improvement and um we see things improving towards the end of the year because we had the first interest rate reduction what we seeing in the marketplace is that people are keeping keeping their cars longer because they can't afford to change them or when they buy they buying down where they look for a cheaper vehicle so there's been a movement uh uh from the consumer side to ensure that when they buy a car they buy a cheaper car or they keep the car they have a lot longer and probably by first quarter of next year I foresee a much better picture because it takes about 3 to 6 months leg after you've reduced the interest rates but also you need two or three r reductions for you to see a bigger movement yeah we seen changes in the EU with regards to the uptake and the adaptation of electric vehicles um I know that in South Africa we're also looking at EVS but more of a h hybrid model as um other parts of the globe you know change their Direction what direction do you foresee South Africa taking I think in South Africa what we're seeing is firstly the uptake of new energy Vehicles is growing at double digits but it's only contributing about and a half% of the total sales but what we seeing in South Africa is the contribution of hybrid vehicles so 85% of EV sales are hybrid we see people buying more hybrids and then later on transition to to EVS but also if you look at the infrastructure I think it's going to take some time to be where we want it to be but what has been interesting is as a buildup to the event we had people that traveled from Johannesburg to Cape Town via using EVS I mean they drove 2,200 km and over a 4-day period and um I think we will later on hear their experience but based on what I've heard from them it was a good experience some good learnings and we see people transitioning I me we live in a global village and people see some of the products around the world a partnership between government and um the private sector uh predicts that if things continue to go well we may see an economic growth of around 3% perom how would this translate into the industry that's already evolved over so many years and what would this 3% economic growth do for the industry I think for for us I think it will grow the market because um we haven't passed the pre pandemic numbers so if we could grow the economy to 3.3% I foresee a demand of our products and I can foresee growth in the industry and once you grow you even are able to localize because this is a scale business so if we can get volume growth we will be able to even localize more and create more jobs as an industry yeah more than 200 days without load shedding um for the industry this must be quite significant as it as it should be um what's your reading of this and also the national the government of national Unity what kind of prospects does it pro uh bring to to your prospects and also your um your outlook in the future I think they I mean I call it the two quarters of no load shedding is good news for us but not only for us but also our suppliers because some of our suppliers are fairly small they cannot afford generators so this has been very good I think where we are now looking at it's it's around the ports I think if we sort up the delays and I think there's a lot of good work that's been done we will be in a good space I think for me the government of national Unity has been I think the the best thing to have happened to us as an indust to the country as well because it brings diversity it's 10 different political parties it's about 70% of the electorate and each Ministry is bringing something different and we're excited about the interactions we've had um with the ministers I mean in the next 48 hours we'll be meeting the minister of ddic and we want to um build that relationship because he's got 5 years to be with us and as an industry we've built this industry to be where it is now we want to take it forward and I think that it's it's a big opport for us to work with them and hopefully also refine on that white paper that still needs um uh to be looked at but before uh we continue on these serious stuff I want to to to to pick your brain about this Nostalgia that the cars behind us they bring to you and what that 1400 represents for you and I think this is an is it a it's a Nissan yes um and what they what they remind you the the rale between bringing the golden oldies to be exhibited here as well what we doing here is to celebrate our 100 years of existence I mean if you look at the 1400 we never even called it the it came days of became but it was known as that's what [Laughter] we from Grandfather to father to grandson and then next to the Bel is the Kumi I mean how many families traveled in those so I think what you have here it's a Heritage of this industry 100 year old industry and um it just shows where we're coming from in the same showroom you've got old vehicles but also energy vles I mean if you look at the BMW stand you'll see a hybrid there and it shows where the is coming from and where it's headed to Mr bom thank you so much I've been speaking to Mr bom he's the president of namsa and he's been giving his views of what's going to be dominating the speaking notes when they meet with government when they meet among themselves and also um looking at the trends and buying patterns of ourselves as consumers and what we've been looking at and um yeah we're going to be speaking to more uh role players also looking at the role of original equipment manufacturers and the challenges that they face in exporting uh some of their ways and how um that can be turned around we're going to be here until Thursday I believe until Thursday and we'll be bringing you blowby blow coverage of what's Happening Here at the Sao week"
ublYG7nMtD4,Project preparation bid window unveiled - Minister Dean Macpherson shares more,2024-10-15T11:37:12Z,10241,Public Works and infrastructure Minister Dean mcferson has unveiled a project preparation bid window inviting applications for project preparation funding the project preparation supports support is a first of its kind set to expand the ability of construction projects to be implemented here in South Africa the project preparation financing will be in energy water and sanitation and transport among other areas in rapidly turning South Africa into a construction site sabc news economics repor K is at that briefing for us and he's standing by thank you very much for joining us K tell us more a very good afternoon to you n and to our viewers at home you know very well that President s ramaa has been talking about turning South Africa into a construction site it's been about 100 days of the government of national unity and the minister at the helm here looking at Public Works and infrastructure is Minister Dean mcferson we see him today just teaming up with infrastructure South Africa to give us a sense of the developments within his Department this is where then they announced this big window around infrastructure project support and this is where then we'll see them inviting most of those role players from the public and the private sector to come through and bid here where infrastructure projects are concerned the minister is here with us has been patient and we're going to invite him into the conversation now to give us a sense of this launch here today you're describing it as a first of its kind it seems that the ball is really rolling where this turning South Africa into an infrastructure site is concerned and we see you saying that there are various of those areas Energy Water uh and sanitation that you'd like to see most of this beers come through to bid and work with the Department in turning this into a reality welcome to the sabc thank you it's great to be here with you it's obviously a a very exciting day um as we do something that's never been done before which is uh create a bid window for uh various spheres of government entities uh uh in government uh and also private sector players that want to work with government uh to come to uh infrastructure South Africa to work with us to prepare to package and put together credible bankable infrastructure projects that can attract also private sector funding so this never been done before so it's a real leap of faith that we taking um but I think that the actions that we are taking today in this bid window is really going to turbocharge and accelerate the infrastructure program uh for this country which we so desperately want to see and which we believe can be a big contributor to not just only growth but job creation as well you're targeting about a 1.5% in terms of economic growth coming through from infrastructure but we know very well that you stepped into this position when there were a mammoth of challenges one of them being the issue of the construction Mafia that will see them hampering some of these development m in terms of the roll out of these projects maybe give us a sense of how this is going to work and if this is going to really be addressed the issue of the construction Mafia so that we don't see some of these bits then not even getting to their fruition because of the challenges on the ground well of course the state has a role to play and we must secure and protect our uh investment uh in construction side so that's the first thing that we all agree on um we are also very clear that working together with Cal governments and local governments and the saps we can come with a common approach of how to uh eradicate The Scourge in our country once and for all because if we are going to create that certainty and sustainability in infrastructure projects and financing we need to be able to give the private sector guarantees that their investment is safe that their projects will be delivered on time and on budget there are of course a number of very difficult conversations and issues that we need to deal with particularly around uh what some might call the Set Side rule the 30% uh that has been hijacked and captured by the construction Mafia and there's no uh small or medium uh Enterprise development or work being done and so they are really really losing out so we need to address that and on the 19th of November we'll be holding a National Construction Summit in eweni where we're all going to come around the table we're going to have mec's from from around the province we have the National Police Commissioner National Police Minister other uh role players in the construction industry and we are going to come up with a common plan a common agreement and then most importantly a program of action on how to implement that so that we are able to protect investment and secure construction sites let's go back to the beating process and maybe give us a breakdown of how this is going to work we know that you're targeting the 6th of December as the cutof date you've already made it clear that no late submissions would be AOW here just give us a sense of what your expectations would be between now and the 6th of December so we are making available 179 million Rand in Project preparation Finance so we will carry that cost um and then the various spheres of government entities of government and private and part uh public sector people that want to work together will be able to conceptualize their projects particularly in places like water and sanitation particularly in energy uh and trans sport they will then come to us they'll put those plans and ideas together we will assess the viability um of those plans we'll have an adjudication committee uh with some very clever people in that space that will assess it and then if we deem their project sufficient enough the value being more than a billion Rand that's also another criteria we will then select that to then be used uh towards the 179 million Rand which will then start putting the technical work into that project so that we make it feasible number one but number two bankable because we have to attract private sector Capital into these projects uh and if you just go there to uh you know anywhere in the world or or locally and say well we like some money you'll probably get turned away if you allow infrastructure South Africa and our team of people to Define that project and and and make it uh into the way that Banks like to view it we have a better chance of being able to fund those projects so this is really it's a it's revolutionary if I can say we've never made this available it's never been done before so I'm eagerly looking forward to the responses and I really invite the the three spheres of government entities of government s soes of government local government to apply to come and sit down and work with us so that we can help you deliver the infrastructure projects that you need either in your Department in your Province or in your town I know you've been working with municipalities as well in getting their house in order as well but we out of time really appreciate you giving us your time this afternoon Minister Dean mcus and just giving us a sense of how things are going to roll out where this bid window is concerned but very important is the 6th of December whereby that cut off date really would be applied also we know very well that around March next year that's when there will be an announcement from the minister around those that have made the cut in terms of this beating process
SFe67g4fdcY,SACP declines invitation to celebrate 100 days of the GNU - Dr Alex Mashilo shares more,2024-10-15T11:35:05Z,4039,"the South African Communist party has declined an invitation from its Alliance partner thec to mark 100 days of the government of national Unity tensions have been rising between the sap and Tuli house leadership with the Communist Party accusing the gnu of betraying the national Democratic Revolution the Communist party has also held a three-day meeting of the central executive committee at the weekend it covered various issues including the country's political economic and social State and reached resolutions on topics including the basic income Grant transformation of The Reserve Bank and expanded public employment let's try and make sense of all of this for you bring in the Sap's National spokesperson Dr Alex mashilo who's with us via our telephone line this morning Dr mashilo great to have you on the sabc thanks for making time let me say up front we're unlikely to get through all of the issues but perhaps we can start with the Central Committee plenary that was held at the weekend more specifically your stance around the gnu from that particular meeting I mean a statement that I have at my disposal is a line where you say you're not necessarily against thec but you I suppose have reservations about the government of national Unity perhaps flesh that out for us as we try place where exactly you stand thank you very much for coming to that issue just to go direct to the point the sap in June called a political Bureau meeting followed by another and a Central Committee so this is the second Central Committee since the elections in may we adopt a critical stance towards the government of national Unity however we have made that clear that our critical stance towards the government of national Unity is not an opposition stance towards thec there is a difference between the two the government of national Unity comprises represent political representatives of rightwing forces of beneficiaries of a parted and of the champions of the ne liberal policies such as austerity such as oppos the opposition to the basic education laws Amendment and the policies that have all along opposed our Advance towards the national health insurance in particular the ba is the anchor of that right so then help us think through how then um it is that the Communist Party can have representation by having members of the organization form part of a cabinet which is Con instituted under this umbrella of the gnu there is only one member of the sap who serves on the cabinet and thanks for highlighting that issue because in other media it has been distorted as if we are a m actually the DA has more people on the cabinet than the sap the DA has six ministers and the sacp national office bar and Central Committee has only one and that one uh representative is there in terms of the AG NC election manual rules which require that your primary position to be there is that of the African National Congress yes we have the right to serve there one we campaign for thec as part of the Alliance 2 we voted for thec if we didn't campaign for thec if we didn't vote for thec the anc's performance in the elections would have been lower think about this just take 300,000 to 1 million votes out of what thec has received you will see the conservative impact that thec would have suffered had we not campaigned for it and had we not voted for it secondly our critical stance towards the government of national unity in terms of political philosophy think about it as a frontal attack in the olden days in the struggle against colonialism attacks could even take the form of weapons and stones and so forth because we are in a Democratic Society the frontal attack that we have launched is that of what we have called a critical stance towards the GMU through the Battle of ideas however that goes hand in hand with what we call the war of position in other words there are important positions which if we were to vacate a f right shift in the government composition will take place and that would be the shortest route to fail in the working class and allowing ourselves to be alienated from our vote and the vote we convered for thec H so to be clear then the advice from the Communist Party to this Lan member from the organization in cabinet is for them to hold the for to stay there as you continue advancing what you say is this critical position uh against the gnu they must hold the because the struggle is taking place not only outside the state it is also taking place within the state let me give you an example the previous parliament passed the education laws Amendment Bill the president didn't sign it during the term of that previous Parliament he only signed it in the current term that bill was passed by the majority represent majority of parliament representing the majority of South African people now pushing the position within cabinet the da came out opposing that act to a point where the president postpones Clause four and five of that particular act you can see that the battle is taking place not only outside of the state but also inside of the state so we have to be everywhere the battle is taking place including where we just have only one member the struggle must go on all right what your response Dr mashida to people who say that's nothing but double speak I mean on the one hand you're incredibly critical of this government formation but on the other you say in fact that there's an agenda to be driven even inside government I mean put differently some people might suggest that your criticism is you chopping off your nose to spite your face no no no no it's not like that that will be to ignore South Africa as he through he fought serious petal in this country the government in 1996 adopted year we fought from within and from without the state eventually there were changes we drove a financial sector transformation campaign there is no other political organization that is De in this country with drove that campaign to a point where the government adopted the national credit Act established the national credit regulator and later this was transformed into the financial sector conduct Authority so in terms of our policy we must be present and push forward the struggle wherever it is taking place all right I'm struggling to find the exact quote but yesterday when the president was speaking that's president Sosa he basically insinuated that the criticism has been leveled against the gnu through media platforms and and the likes what do you know about conversations or at least efforts to have conversations um with the leadership of Luli house behind closed doors in order to iron out some of these issues I can tell you the president was not referring to the sa I can tell you he was referring to other people the reason why he was not referring to the sap is this we met in an alliance political Council briefing session where we told the president and the entire leadership of the office Paras of thec and KATU that we are against any coion arrangement with the Dau did the same the media was not present one happened on two occasions so he might be referring to other people but not to us because we raised these views not only inside of the alliance but also outside"
vK8E8UyOkZY,Lusikisiki Mass Murder | 45 year old man appears for bail application,2024-10-15T11:32:45Z,11005,the other big story has been unfolding in the Eastern Cape though a 45-year-old man appearing at the luiki mes Court a short while ago it was meant to be for for mobile application that's in connection with the killing of 18 people you might remember at in goana Village the man though has abandoned that application with the case postponed to the 26th of next month scores of people have also been seen attending those particular proceedings and watching developments for us as our reporter who joins us now live from just outside Court um perhaps you can give us a bit more details around what took place inside Court as you take us through the visuals we can see of many people there who are making their presence fault even though proceedings have now been postponed oh thank you very much we are coming live from luiki at the suspect the 45 yearold suspect yes has just appeared before the court of law but what came out of the court is that he attorney that he is now abandoning foral bail application he decided to remain in custody then the court H postponed the bail application to the 26th of November 2024 but now I'm joined by uh the spokesperson of the victims that perished in th Sig Massac Mr David King David this man has abandoned bail application what is your feeling about that thanks for having me G and uh uh greetings to your viewers uh we we are happy that he abandoned his bail uh it wasn't necessary in any case because you'd remember he's actually he was actually out on parole so obviously his parole was going to be revoked in any case so he didn't really he was just wasting the the Court's time and uh but the the one thing that we are worried now because the the Luigi court has a very bad history when it comes to ballistic test results uh it it it withdraws cases quite a number of cases that have been withdrawn in in the Lu court for one simple reason where the ballistic test with the firearms that have been uh found have not been taken to the ballistic test now we are hearing that the firearm in question has been taken for a ballistic test and we are hoping that those results will eventually come back so that the court proceedings can take on we heard from the court that there also three other suspects that are wanted maybe is there any hope that those people will be brought to book also yeah having having spoken to uh some senior police officials they've assured me that they are on their toes uh that they are looking for them they know who they looking for and they are going to find them so I'm hopeful that uh not not long they will find them and bring them to to court now here in this premises these premises there are a lot of people family members the villagers political parties they have come to support So for sure you must be at least happy about the support that you are receiving from the people we we are very we are very very happy with the support that we are receiving and it is clear that this is not just the family's concern only but it has become a community concern because the communities are concern are fearful in their own homes hence they have come here to support us to say uh this must come to an end this must stop thank you very much that was uh David King who speaking on behalf of the victims as you can see here at these residents these villagers these people that have lost their loved ones they are picking outside they are calling on for justice to be done for those people who have L left them because you understand that 18 people were gned down including 15 15 women that were part and parcel of this massacre but these women here are dancing chanting calling on a government to do something about gender based violence and also calling government to make sure that people are protected in their respective communities
6WJMtPagWnw,Focus on science behind toxicology reports - Dr Gerhard Verdoorn shares more,2024-10-15T10:36:28Z,343,the families of the children who died tragically in Nady from suspected food poisoning are still waiting for Toxicology results to confirm what actually cause their debts but how long do these investigations typically take and how easy is it to actually establish a direct link for that let's bring in toxicologist Dr K furan who's with us now via our video link Dr furan thanks very much indeed for your time and patients welcome to the sabc perhaps we can just start by understanding what goes typically into the process of conducting these toxicology tests because in this particular instance I'm not even sure if the families or investigators were able to get samples of what these kids allegedly ate well one would actually start off with the deceased in other words with a postmortem analysis conducted by the pathologist they would need to take some examples and those would have to be submitted then to the forensic laboratory so there two things they would need to do with those samples first of all they would have to go and test for any bacterial toxins in other words the typical clostridium or salmonella that's implicated mostly in food poison in South Africa or actually all around the world but more importantly for me is to go and detect whether there are any pesticides in that food because I am not convinced about the fact that this is actually a typical food poisoning it sounds to me more like poison that was in the food other words um an agrochemical or a pesticide that we talk in the normal sense so that is is what needs to be done for the postmortem and secondly then is to do proper interrogation of the parent to find out what the children ate where they buy those particular food stuff to go back to those sources of the food stuff and investigate what happened in that particular vendor shop or in the spor shop or maybe at the street vendor because what we find in the country is that um the conditions at these retailers or these SP shops and the street vendors are very appalling and very often they sell typical food stuff that children eat Like Biscuits or candies or these little popsicles and stuff like that in between pesticides which are illegal pesticides they're not registered they're actually very very toxic and they sell them in between the candies and all these biscuits the kids eat and if there's any mishap there like a packet breaking or a bottle spilling over the food stuff the children eat in good faith will actually be poisoned by the pesticide and I believe that these children were poisoned by pesticide it wasn't a typical food poisoning because with food poisoning you seld them if ever get a patient passing away where with what we see in the couple of last couple of months or the year actually is that we cases where suspected food poisoning turned into total mortality of all the patients so it tells me it was actually a pesticide and not actually the typical food poison caused by bacteria that's interesting because we've already heard some of the people who sell in that Community saying that in fact you know as far as they're concerned their stuff is above board in fact one of them went as far as to say that they too consumed that food and so the insinuation there is that it wouldn't necessarily be uh contained any toxins my question is um how easy is it to create a direct link in a context where of course you know the facts are being contested which is the case in this instance well the retailer will will sell them if ever come up with a true fact because now the retailer is implicated in the death of the children but what I've seen myself going out with the police and the Metro people and agriculture Department into many of these part of shops and Street vendors is like I said they sell the street pesticides the unlawful pesticides in between all of the food stuffs and um people buy the food stuff like like they might buy a packet of noodles or they might bu open biscuits or a packet of open uh CPS and alongside with that they will buy Street pesticide and in that bag they can be contamination when they get home they leave those Street pesticides in the open the children have access to it and in some cases we've even had um stories where people think that the black granules which is alicar is actually black pepper and they use it on their food as a as a condent for the food and that leads then to the certain poisoning and the possible death of the people um I just don't believe that it is food poisoning and it is very simple to get poison because there is a lack of control over with these unlawful poison ENT the country literally buy the tons every month from foreign countries by Foreign Nationals bring it in it SS to people who have no idea what they're buying from the street vendors and from the spaza shop the spasa shop sell it unlawfully it's in between the food stuffs not like in a typical store where you walk in where you got your aisle with your detergents you got your aisle with your home and garden pesticide you got your AIS with a proper package food these are informal so there's no proper control over separation of toxins versus the food and it can happen at the level of the vendor it can happen in the package that being taken home it can happen at the home itself and unfortunately there are some implications also where some of the food stuffs are Del deliberately laced with the pesticide and I don't know why it happens because we had a case in Port Elizabeth where three kids died after eating noodles that were lce with turbos and they didn't last 2 hours before they died in the hospital and sadly it is always the poor people so the poor people are at the brunt of this illegal activity and it's actually horrific for me to hear that there are more and more in cases of kids and young people dying because of these types of poisoning and it all goes back to a lawless Society where the authorities I don't think have control over it and I don't blame them because they are under severe stress with all the the crime we going to deal with but somehow we got to get to the grip of it because it's unacceptable for me as a the toxicologist and organic chemist to hear every day of more and more people being poisoned to the point of fatality food poisoning can go because we all know that people buy food which is off you get sick you get nauseous get vomiting but you all recover but what we see now is most definitely a severe situation that I think the government must take control of and sort out because it's unacceptable absolutely how long um do these tests typically take if the laboratory is um geared up with all the equipment and most Laboratories have good equipment uh including the state and they've got good technologist doesn't matter whether you work for the state or for private or for the police or for the typical forensic Laboratories if they do have to do the culturing for finding out whether the bacteria are there that would take anything from four to possibly seven days if they have to do analysis for any pesticide poisons or any other poisons that should take no longer than seven days so if they speed up the process and I do believe in a case like this where five children died they need to speed up the process we should be able to get an answer from theor within 7 days what the chemical was or what the biological chemical was that caused the poison because it can either be a biological substance like for example a bacterium or it can be a chemical toxin like I mentioned alicar or turb for Doras or methas these are the ones which are mostly implicated but it shouldn't take longer than a week to 10 days to get those results out availabity all right I suppose in some ways they're still within that window cuz my next question was going to be whether or not in this particular case we're taking longer than we should but if you say up to 10 days then I suppose we should know by the end of this week what actually may have led to those deaths Dr furin let me thank you for your time and your Insight really do appreciate you speaking to us dral fan is a toxicologist for
-EQKW430ua0,Democracy 30 | Economic transformation three decades later,2024-10-15T10:06:14Z,1027,"a multi-trillion Rand economy poised to grow even stronger over the coming years but who controls it and how many of its citizens have a share in it good evening welcome to democracy 30 My Name is Oliver Dixon it's the main talking point that remains highly contested across Society as Citizens reflect on South Africa's democracy gains tonight we ask the question why does South Africa's economy remain unlar UNR transformed 30 years after democracy joining us for this discussion is Kani mataban who's the CEO of the black Business Council and car karia from the business Unity South Africa we but first let's watch this insert put together by naria dambuza component part of the issue of reconciliation and nation building is is defined by and derives from the material conditions in our society which have divided our country into two Nations the one black the other white we therefore make bold to say that South Africa is a country of two Nations seen as a controversial speech made four years after the dawn of South Africa's democracy as the reconciliation project was still at its infancy former president spoke about one Society one white and one black characterized by development experiences that differed on the basis of their race in 1994 the South African economy was skewed in favor of the mainly white minority groups due to deliberate legislation that excluded blacks from opportunities in the labor market and direct ownership of businesses and land the emphasis must certainly be on a Liberation true liberation of the black community not only politically but also so economically we are we had focused in the past more on political Liberation uh to almost the total exclusion of economic uh Liberation to remedy this the post 94 State introduced the bbbee act in 2003 to open up opportunities for previously disadvantaged groups which was followed by the codes of good practices and charters for various Industries such as construction private security cing and transport while some black millionaires emerged the program itself was criticized for empowering a few Elites of politically connected black individuals and still leaving a sea of poverty across Society the business sector on the other hand has been on the receiving end of criticism for their alleged refusal to transform with the state being accused of failing to be tough against the sector according to the government information as at this year about 200,000 workers have shared ownership in the companies for which they work and there's over half a million worker ownership in companies across the South African economy we observed that the political power that was transferred to the black majority through inclusive election in 1994 was never transformed into economic freedom economic freedom has now become a rallying point in political circles as old and new politicians realize that South Africans are losing patience after waiting to see the fruits of democracy some believe what this country urgently needs is what they call radical economic transformation but whatever the term appeals in the evolution of the South African story it will only resonate with the majority of ordinary South Africans when they find real meaning in their own lives Nadia dambuza democracy 30 and we're now joined in conversation by kaban who's the CEO of the black Business Council as well as casaria who's with business business Unity South Africa I want to start with you K this evening who owns South Africa's economy and who controls it by and large how much do ordinary citizens have a share in it good evening and thank you very much for for for invitation and and let me say good evening to K as well the we 30 years into democracy and and and I think it's important to also look at the context of where we come from you'll know black people were not allowed to study certain subject including mathematics that allows you to to study engineering CH accountancy and all those type of things uh and and and as such black people have been basically excluded from from from participating meaningfully in the in the economy in the past and then enhance when democracy started they were certain instruments that were brought including employment Equity that was was brought by former minister of Labor then D so rest in peace and and and and broad-based black economic empowerment and and the public procurement legislations that came that time to try and bring black people into the fault and then 30 years later uh we we have black people owning less than 5% of the economy we've got almost 70% of the CEOs of the JC listed companies being white males and and when you look at the ownership by by by by what do they call share ownership by employees there has been much some progress there but but the most of those share ownership schemes are also fronting schemes because um some of the shareholders who are supposed to be shareholders are not necessarily shareholders they don't have share certificates because if you own a company you must have a share certificate so that there's been a lot of H what what one can call subtle reluctance to to transform the economy and and I think if we don't do anything it will go on and on and on until the people decide that we've had enough so our push for economic transformation is informed by the fact that we need to protect the democracy and and you can only protect the Democracy if you are saying those who were excluded by legislation must be brought into the fault because remember South Africa is different from Europe and the US where you are trying to include or empower the minority when you are trying to empower the minority you can delay as much as you want because they are they don't have the numbers to to to render the country ungovernable but if we don't we keep on excluding the majority one day they'll wake up and say no let's render this democracy and governable because it does not benefit us so going back to your issue of a ordinary man on the street ER yeah they don't have much to to say because unemployment if you look at unemployment 30 years into democracy the majority of unemployed people got down 75% youth unemployment the majority of them are black men and and women a a anything that is sort of not going okay or negative is mainly the majority of the players there will be black people yeah so it it shows we are not necessarily bringing them into the fault uh to to be owners managers and controllers of their own economy because remember this is their own country this but but they not participating unfortunately yeah C the rudimentary definition of inequality is the measurement of the distance between the wof and the disenfranchised now that distance is larger today than it was in 1994 which inadvertently tells us that uh The Well of have been able to consolidate uh their means and resources while the thisen franchise have uh been forced to uh split the little they have even further amongst each other why has it gotten worse for us in the last 30 years well I think it depends on how you look at this so so the ownership of the economy by black people is just under about 30% because let's remember that many corporates are owned by Pension funds uh including investment incorporates by the pic on behalf of the government pension fund and so indirectly black people also own companies through those pension fund now why has it gotten worse is that the economy has grown substantially I mean we don't have significant growth now but if one compar it to pre democracy days in economy has grown and and the the issue is that with the economy growing population has also grown and for a whole range of reasons we haven't in the last 10 to 15 years kept up the with the economic growth we had in the let's say the Tabo emaki residency and as the economy has contracted in the last last 10 to 15 years the ability to create jobs the ability to actually plow in the sorts of money we need to plow in in social services including education including support of smmes and so on have decreased on top of that where where we have had the money we've mismanaged the money to a great extent dur State capture years and so we haven't put into place the mechanisms to enable the majority of our people to actually participate in an so we quite clear as as Busa and we said this time and time again the work we are doing with government currently in partnership with government in addressing energy issues logistic issues and crime and Corruption issues it's all to put our country onto a sustainable and inclusive growth path in a way that we make necessary interventions to ensure that all of our people benefit from that the legislative tools that were brought into the early days of our democracy such as the broad-based black economic empowerment act which at the time was just the black economic empowerment act the public procurement preferential act uh employment Equity act these were all um pieces of legislature that was at its core at its heart was meant to be redressive uh to the disenfranchisement of pre- democracy South Africa have they been helpful and effective legislative tools I think the legislative tools were necessary because I think as hanki said earlier I'm sorry Han I didn't even say hello to you apologist as hki said earlier that that in the apartate days the apartate government intervened legislatively to ensure that the majority of the people in this country did not participate in the economy so post democracy we had to intervene legislatively to ensure that black people started participating in the economy so I think the legislation certainly in our view was necessary I think in our view where we fell short is that we didn't concentrate on the broad-based nature of black black uh we we've had we have a number of black people black senior black people have benefited from this but if we really wanted to look at broad-based black economic empowerment we had to ask ourselves the questions what do we need to do to enable the majority of the people to benefit from growth yeah and so I just want to pause you there because Kan I want to put this question to you you had earlier spoken about a tick boxing exercise and to paraphrase it what you're effectively saying is that what we've had with these pieces of legislation is malicious compliance compliance for the sake of it but not compliance in spirit talk to us about what that looked like over the last 30 years in practice yeah thanks I think maybe let me just go to the ownership issue the the the the 30% is not correct because we're talking about direct ownership because why should black ownership be measured through indirect ownership while white people are owning such as what the P yeah the p is not the black or pension fund of any sort yeah the p is not a black person so so there are white public servants who who are still benefiting from the P so p cannot be classified as black so we are talking about direct black ownership of the economy but that was a by the way the the challenge is that those who have are very reluctant to to give back what they got whether they got it wrongly or not or not they they are very reluctant hence we've got this give back or to share yeah to share because it's to share because this is our country so so there has been a lot of ticking of boxes and then maybe because the legislation itself brought us to here where we're saying if you do this you get so many points if you do this you get so many points so it be it becomes almost like a a compliance so so for example companies will say no let's appoint a black woman and we'll get so many points and not necessarily ask let's appoint the best possible candidate who just so happens to be a black woman is yeah and also also what they do then they don't give those black people real jobs you know I want us to put a pin in that and come back to that because we were talking earlier about employee share schemes and whether that's a real means of ownership in a company and its future we continue the conversation on the other side of this this is democracy 30 don't go away and welcome back to democracy 30 tonight we ask the question 30 years into our democracy why does South Africa's economy remain largely untransformed before we go back to the conversation I want to bring your attention to the next set of data looking at a graph that gives us a sense of the picture of uh race and gender split of the ownership of South Africa's economy when you look at JSC listed companies about 50.8% of the South African uh ownership of the jsse happens to still be white male and female uh the rest of it is split between only 21.4% being uh black male and only 17.8% being black women but more importantly I want us to take a look at the be practice and what that looks like in the following graphic perhaps to go and take a look at very specifically uh the score that uh one can say at comfortably at this level we're talking about a company that is largely transformed when we look at black ownership uh scores of companies many of them at level three reach only about a 86 to 75% level if you look at 2023 in particular that number trickled back back upwards but it is also in the other metrics such as socio Economic Development and Enterprise uh and supplier development where the real uh Equity lies in right and and that is around 76% in 2013 um and 131 companies rather and 76 companies rather meeting that score uh in at at a level three standard in in in 2023 Kan uh we we want to perhaps bring your attention to here to this when we talk about be compliance we usually think it only means uh that a company uh has enough black people but it's it's not just about do we have enough black people in management level in executive management uh as directors and perhaps even a shareholders but also are we spending our money with other black companies such as for instance Enterprise and Supply development and social economic development do we by and large as South African companies get that right you're a member based organization so are you Cass uh are your members getting it right yeah so so maybe just just to talk about the the the graphics that you put there so we in our experience we've gone to companies where they say they're level one and and when you get into the company you don't see level one the only black person is a driver there and the and the te lady which tells you that and we've raised this with the new minister of of of trade industry and competition Mr P that there are be verification agencies because this this information comes from be verification agencies well in this instance this very specific data we showed you come from the sunlam transformation barometer which is industry standard data yeah but but the levels uh the people who are verifying the levels are B verification agencies and in in in our our investigation we've realized that majority of them are are basically open to the highest bider so they come to you and say you are level four and you say no no I'm not I'm not happy I'm going to the next one the next one gives you level one so there's a there's a big problem with the standardization you and I two years ago you and I sat in a talk by TI Muna had just become the new Commission of the of the be Commission in said they cracking down on that do you think it's possible no it won't be possible with the current capacity that they have the big be H commission doesn't have capacity they don't have the people in terms of the numbers they don't have the quality in terms of the capacity and and experience and skills so they they won't be able to get it until they they are well capacitated with the proper professionals with the proper skills who can be able to deal with complicated transactions because people take complicated transactions there so if you got people who don't have skills they they won't understand those transactions so until we we we we we we get the system to work we're not going to get anywhere because even some of this research is mainly half cooked we need to get a proper research that is done that is holistic and then as we speak now in the country there's no research that is holistic that tells you how much uh black people own and then all those type of things so it's important that we need to get back to the basics so that we can then say is this thing working or not but at the moment most of the people people are just thumbsucking information instead of coming with the holistic information that says 30 years into democracy is this uh working or not if it's not working what do we do but but for us we need to remember you only have to have 25% plus one share ownership to to be almost fully compliant and that was is a minimum because remember black people make up of 92% of the population so the ownership of the economy must reflect 92% of the population the control the management must reflect that but at the moment it doesn't yeah C I want to take your Jo your memory back about two years ago where the jsse uh sent out a notice to uh one of its listed companies which is a major pharmaceutical retailer in South Africa and an fmcg and they had said hey we noticed that you're U haven't met the minimum standards for one of the categories here which is around middle and Senior Management uh you don't have enough black people people employed over there uh will be issuing you with penalties uh should that not be uh corrected the CEO of that company sent out a moratorium saying sent out a memo saying they're placing a moratorium on hiring white managers that memo had leaked into the public um and that company faced a lot of backlash to the point where the CEO withdrew that memo uh on on on saying that we very specifically have to fill the vacancies we have with black managers that was a progressive thing on part of that CEO to say but the society said no um this we're not not going to tolerate the specifically white South Africans uh that that led to that sort of backlash is there a real willingness for transformation to take place where it's most needed I think there is a willingness for transformation to take place and not because uh you know established business people are good guys or good girls it's because any business person worth his or her sort recognizes that if the majority of the people in this country do not have a stake in this economy let alone reaching let alone sustaining 5% growth rate we can't even reach 5% growth rate it's it simply can't be done so businesses in this country establish businesses in this country have a long-term approach towards their businesses and want their businesses to grow and to survive and to sustain sustain themselves over the medium to long term transformation is absolutely critic okay now I I have a view on this and and in in reply to your question this isn't in my view a white or black issue you know transformation in this country is not only something that black people should be worried about transformation in this country is something we should all be concerned about do you think do you sorry Cass do you think that Business Leaders in this country have the foresight that you're talking talking about right that if you want your business to be a South African business and remain active in this country you have to take Serious transformation when we take a look at the fact that uh seven out of 10 directors on the jsse are white seven out of 10 directors uh C where are the black directors on the JSC um and and and if those businesses that appoint those directors um have the foresight then surely it would have looked significantly different yeah so so again I think that if you if you break that down into companies I think most major corporates have significant black representation on their company boards okay smaller and mediumsized listed companies might have more difficulty in doing that because they don't have the sort of uh uh development capacity that bigger corporates would have so I think that we need to barrel down into these figures a little bit and we need to understand where the weaknesses are and how we deal with those weaknesses it's not weaknesses across the board okay so so I I think that and and you know Ki says that because of the way some of the the the verification agencies have behaved the figures might not be worth the paper they written on well you know the sandem figures are verified by empowered deck and by cm these are major respected company and and if verification agencies are conducting themselves in a way that makes it very difficult for us to actually have this debate because we might not be having the proper data then they must be acted against yeah uh you know the law must take its course because we can't say well we can't do anything because we don't have the capacity to do anything then how seriously are we taking transformation yeah Kan I'm going to give you the last B you we l have less than a minute left before we close off the show in 2020 when Co hit uh the world the president had announced a loan guarantee scheme through the banks available for businesses black businesses struggled the most to access that loan guarantee scheme why is that yeah the challenges was the the criteria so for example the criteria was saying H you must not be listed in the credit bureaus uh you must have been operating for a certain period and remember you're coming from covid where most of the small businesses in general did not have the balance sheet so what happens if if you don't have income coming you won't have uh anything to pay with expenses so but the government guaranteed the loan right so it means that the collateral requirements should have been far lower than what they are no no I think I think I think it was it was almost like a public relations exercise the the requirements were still there yeah the same or even even much much tougher because if you are in a crisis like covid you can't say someone must not being listed must be in good standing and and then to be in good standing you must not have missed an installment at some stage so who who's going to qualify it's only people who got the the balance sheet unfortunately it was not necessarily conceptualized properly there was nothing wrong with the scheme but I think the requirements were just a bit tough yeah we're going to have to leave with the of business Unity South Africa thank you so much for your time appreciate it of the black Business Council thank you so much and that brings us to the end of the show we will bring you another installment of democracy 13 next week uh so please do be with us at 8:00 p.m. if you miss any part of this episode you can find it on the SBC News YouTube channel My Name is Oliver Dixon good night"
u4rl0-6-HYQ,Expressions | Bullying in schools,2024-10-15T10:02:36Z,335,hey he hey hey hey heyy hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey heyyy hey hey hell and welcome to your number one show Expressions well following the recent incidents matters of mental health and awareness concerning bullying have come to the four in the wake of bullying sins from at Pine town at ketn at Bradford a free state and many other provinces have a zero tolerance policy towards Expressions we are deeply hurt by the occurrence of bull untimely death has left many in his rural community shocked he was allegedly bullied by some of his Educators his fellow Learners believe a recent bullying incident involving his report cut being published to the entire School may have contributed to the suicide the school management says Mya was struggling with various subjects his classmates and friends are distraught they witnessed some of the alist bullying he was insulted by those Tre and it happened regularly so it seems like the reason you to his life it was because of our teachers who treat us badly or talk us badly to us teach every time that there are second parents but if a a real parents who know Li never treat his child like that the family says Mya started showing signs of academic stress recently they were also informed by some Learners that he was constantly bullied by teachers he wrote the letters that the teachers were bullying okay so he did he he he didn't be he was not able to come to us and talk to us cuz he was stressed sometimes he had headache and he can't talk so is May was described as a reserved and quiet person Joseph was quiet he would not argue with anyone if someone tried to argue with him he would respectfully walk away to help me unpack this discussion in studio we are joined by Mr who is a director for school safety from Department of Education alongside him we have Mr un M who is a CA Secretary General thank you so much for joining us and such a heavy topic um I want to start with you I mean just reflecting on the Insight that just played it's really sad because unfortunately he died in the hands of bullies from your consultation view how prevalent you know are cases of bullying and what's the common cost no there are very great in number in fact as CA us we we we we have been dealing with cases of bullying before they get to anywhere else they start with us because you have many parents who will make these reports of being of their Learners being bullied and and all of that H in fact we have full full access to to to to to Learners there at our schools they do send us messages and all of that so we we know them to be one of the greatest challenges that um are being faced by many Learners in our schools from many many provinces we have specifically identified quintal one 2 and three schools as the main schools wherein you're going to find greater greater numbers of bullying cases so it's mostly the underprivileged Learners who go through this very sad and very painful reality this is so sad and I mean throughout the provinces because I mean this is really a serious matter where you know because of bullying what sort of policy measures do you have in place to ensure that you address and not only address by thank you very much for inviting us it's quite sad when we see uh Learners having to you know lose their lives because of bulling um because it's not supposed to be uh like that uh but all that I can say is that at a school level what we encourage schools to have is to have learner codes of conduct whereby all the rules of the school schools uh with the applying sanctions are actually placed H so that the school itself will be in a position to deal with the issues of bullying within the schools themselves and I mean it's it's even sad because in this case we even see teachers but now we are seeing teachers like we had a cas old girl was bullied by because of her ancestral gift you know I mean if we are going to have employers within Department of Education what sort of measures you hold them accountable yeah it is indeed sad where the bullying is now perpetrated by teachers especially in the case of uh our lner that we have just witnessed here uh but as a Department of Education obviously there are measures that are in place uh for teachers I understand the case uh from limoo is being investigated and uh there will be uh appropriate uh sanctions uh that will uh be sort of H given to the teacher because we are not supposed to have teachers pulling our children exactly and I mean with that said un I mean with the measures that are put in place do you think they are really effective because do you think I mean looking at this incidents are they effective no no they are not at all um as coas we we have been fighting for peace in our schools H for about more than a decade now more than decades in fact because from the very formation of the Congress of South African students the main main purpose of our formation was that we maintain a Unity amongst students and we're saying that this is not is no long in fact a matter of the Department of basic education alone it's a state issue within the past two weeks I can count about more than 20 lers who were either killed or sent to the hospital because of either bullying food poisoning or or or or suicide you know and rape in our schools we're dealing for example now with two situations in the Eastern Cape I don't think media has has that yet where Elena got raped and a video was taken of that particular incident happening she then committed suicide after that and the second lner was a male got stabbed seven times by by by by teenagers so I saying there's a lot that is happening in our schools and this thing that we always have of a Department responding by giving us spokespersons to address the media it's not right we are supposed to have a long-term program that is adopted to spend all the amount of resources that the department has to completely eradicate violence in our schools so we've been saying that it's a matter of the state the president of this country owes us a an intervention program to make sure that this issue of PE of of violence in our schools of debts and everything gets completely eradicated this is something that can manifest into a child's Al wult because of that bullying and you know I want to come to you Mr Goo because I mean this is a serious issue that will affect mental health what services are available to ensure within the schools we have what is known as school based support teams because we do understand that if a learner has been challenged because of issues of bulling the actual assistance must come within the school itself uh following the school based support teams you also have your District support uh teams uh so that if the matter becomes severe then it is escalated at a district level so those are some of the measures that are there uh but there are other uh attempts that they will a bit about them right after the break make sure you don't move a muscle CU when we come back we have a very interesting case study you're watching Expressions welcome back you're still watching expressions for sure if you've just joined us today we are talking about bullying at our schools to help me unpack this discussion right now I'm joined by the Holo family Valen Holo and H and also H guys welcome to Expressions than yeah um I know today we are discussing a very uh serious matter I know that you guys are both victims of bullying Kellan I just want to start with you just talk me through some of the impediments and the obstacles that you faced at schools when it comes to bullying what happened so bullying is really a lot to go to there's like a lot of different types of bullying there's verbal there's physical there's social and way more that like hasn't even been discovered yet so I was verbally bullied in my primary school and my high school um it's not easy being called names all your life and for certain things that you do and certain ways that you act you talk you dress and um yeah it's just a lot to go through now which extent did it reach cuz I understand that you ended up in hospital at some point you know yeah it reached a very high like State because it went to a certain level where I wanted to commit suicide um because I've been bullied since grade three up until my grade seven years and the suicide happened in about grade four yeah so it was very bad very sad indeed now Yugo I also just want to come to you you know as your sisters just mentioned there are many many forms of of of of of bullying you know there's name calling and it escalates sometimes to being physically abused what what sort of abuse did you face at school I faced verbally verbal abuse so there would always be kids calling me names physical abuse to trying to kick me tripping me chasing us after me and just all things like that all right so uh Valencia when your kids came to you obviously to tell you about what was happening at school just talk me through some of the impediments that you had to see them go through you know was it difficult for them sometimes to go to school and wake up in the morning and go to school well with kyanne I could see something was bothering because she started getting migraines and she was very she would come from school and then she would just sit in a room so keanne is very introvert kind of person so she would read one book the whole day so we'd get the books every week from Kum books and I could see that there was something weird about kyanne because she was just shut it down in a room and then there was this time that she just kept quiet for the whole day and in the morning I was she was acting quite weird because she was stumbling around and I asked her what's wrong and she just gave me now she's got a mug that she takes coffee in um or a hot chocolate before she goes to school so she gave me the mug and I saw tablets in the mug so I asked her Kelly an what did you do so um I've got a schedule four and a schedule five cuz I'm um disabled in my right hand so she took my tablets so like those tablets one can knock you out for the whole day so she took child she took five of those and five of the other one and she started stumbling and that was the time and I took it to school so I reached school and I told the teacher immediately I'm taking it to hospital cuz Kean told me she took tablet and what puzzled me about this teacher she came to the count she said she had to interview kilan oh and I asked her my child is dying and you still want to interview how do you get that and she said no she has to find out right on that point I still want to cross back to Osa with Mr to find out what do we do in such a situation how do we get Justice to be served to K and colosa thank you so much aaria Mr goesa you know I'm pretty sure I mean you listening to the whole in case study which is quite sad I mean and what is a Way Forward um you know that is why as a department we're saying we want Learners to get actual assistance at school however if the problem is such that the parent feels that the school perhaps is not doing enough H the parent can escalate the matter to the district office but I can tell you from the Department of basic education there are policies and one of the interventions that we are trying to to to do is to make sure that this becomes part of curriculum so that it is taught in the class so that Learners especially the police must know that it is wrong it's not supposed to from the what do they do they go to the district office um in in the case I I did not hear the entire story but I would have loved to find out how did the school assist them because the first point of authority especially that is closer to the child is the the the school never assisted them even the Justice it failed so it's like they really need solution definitely I would advise them that maybe even after this particular show we can Avail our numbers so that we can uh see what was the intervention from the school what was the intervention from the district we would want to to make sure that they they should be hold accountable because this is a child now ma'am just to continue with the conversation I just want to ask you the poor question which we are asking today on the show do you think that the rules and the regulations at our schools are they strong enough to protect our kids from bullying not at all not at all there's actually no system in the school because they tell you to go to the governing to write a letter they taking it to the governing body which just gets it it disappears cuz nothing actually happened they made us feel like we were doing something wrong and nothing happened it was just swept under the C cupboard like when she like at the school that she's now it happened at that school as well they took action immediately those kids were dressed immediately their parents were called in immediately and they were taken out of the class there's just certain schools that just feel they can get away with it and it's just that and we hope that the Department of Education will be able to assist us SCH Point you're still watching Expressions right here on Sac 1 Welcome Back you're still tuning into your expressions welcome back we wrapping the discussion and I mean besides just wanting Solutions we want long-term strategic plans I do understand Mr earlier on you did I mean you looking into introducing a curriculum has it started how do they get access currently we are busy training subject advisors and teachers especially now that we are focusing on cyber bullying um we have realized that this cannot just be left hanging it has to be taught in class so that Learners can you know appreciate and become a good digital citizens so that is what is supposed to do Empower Learners within the classroom about the wrongfulness of you know uh bullying other Learners I am bullied be it by you know my fellow and it's kind of hard for me to report because what do I do and I'm talking about an emergency response um see what we've always been saying as C is that there is no such a such a thing as a good response if you speak about AA having to report to the district director to the district official department head of office that is not a good solution it's the worst solution you could ever Poss come up with but we've instead said each and every school in South Africa must be stationed an independent psychologist that will not be per se working for the school but working for the better interest of the Learners who are within the school such that if you have people for example who going to say I'm at school now it's at it's during classes and I want to kill myself now the learner could quickly go to a psychologist who has been addressing Learners who've been having a comfortable relationship with them wherein they can be freely free to express themselves and all those things so it's not it's not long-term solutions that we yet getting from the Department because these ones of these systems of leaders of of the department they're very difficult to access even themselves even amongst themselves they can't access themselves so we need now a long-term solution to say there must be someone in our schools to work there must be someone in our schools Mr would you safely say that you know as the department you are doing enough to ensure that you combat bullying looking at these incidents and I mean the case study we had on second segment H I would say we are doing enough but we also understand that there are those schools whose policies are weak and uh just like we have had the the the the the incident that was related to us but it is those schools that we are actually encouraging that they must strengthen their codes of conduct so that even the bullies just they don't just get scot-free but there are measures that each school is putting to ensure that Learners who bully others are taken to task and it's a responsibility when you know for all of us you know it's not certain organization but let's make noise on social media in our schools by DJ for it let me see let me see sh B let me see sh B 100 B let me sh it let me sh it let me sh it let me sh it let me sh it sh sh sh Ita it down down down down get down me sh it wo wo wo wo
vh6lrGP-tcQ,Looking into the causes of mass killings,2024-10-15T10:00:02Z,1599,the country has certainly seen a disturbing rise in mass killings recently leaving communities in shock and fear these tragic incidents often occur in public spaces sometimes in people's homes raising questions about the underlying causes the most recent incident of course was an orange form that's where eight people were shot and killed including the suspect who turned the gun on himself what does this tell us about the kind of society perhaps we're now living in let's bring in our guests as we try to answer that question and many others criminologist professor uh Jacob muuk is with us also joining us a sociologist Dr Trev um who are both with us via our video link as we unpack perhaps even some of the psychological underpinnings of this alarming Trend to both our guests it's lovely to have you on the sabc thanks very much indeed for speaking to us Professor muuk King I wonder if I can start with you mass killings are certainly not new sadly in a country like ours but it really does feel like there's been an uptick in this level of violence does that kind of Cor respond at least from what you've been able to observe with your own experience uh good morning ayanda uh good morning to Dr Trevor as well ASC news viewers it has been a very disturbing phenomenon in South Africa to be able to uh observe that even though after Democratic dispensation that we promote the culture of Human Rights know the right to life but we have been crippled with this reality that you know uh we have adopted the so-called uh Instinct you know uh killing Instinct whereby how we resolved our issues it is through the taking of lives we have observed you know the you know compound of Anger of accretion you know across the country and how you know taking a life of another human being is just easy so uh the cases of Luc and you know cting orang Farm as well as in Natal as well as other provinces it's just an indicative of an a very violent society and individuals that are very angry and how you know it's so easy you know to to kill another human being then that's why then there has been a call for whether do we need a specialized unit in South afria afri to be able to look at you know circulation of illegal Firearms you know extortion as well as you know Ming of you know you know U innocent people you know so that we can be able to minimize the issue of mass killing so it is you know what we observe as you know how the new South African has adopted this culture of violence from you know previous regime whereby you know people were oppressed and you know how they were killed but in that part you know it was easy by that time to be able to justify the killing of another or how then we have to respond to the oppressive you know regime but unfortunately you know the cases of hijing where people will lose their lives you know and people will lose their houses if they don't respond to the demands of extortion you know where the family members will be killed it just indicative that indeed we are very disorganized Society there's a lack of cion in South Africa and it looks like you know our political parties or leaders they failed you know and then hence then there's so much pressure on the South African Police Service to be able to bring this this organization yeah you know into anable level and we'll speak about the work of the saps in just a moment especially when it comes to things like intelligence but drani let me bring you into the discussion as a start to get your opening remarks I mean the work of sociologists is to explain society as best as they can what explanation can we give in the back of this kind of trend yeah it is uh very sad but I must start with a disclaimer yeah because I speak as a sociologist but as a community activist and activist scholar I'm involved in my local cpf uh I've got a position there also I'm a patroller so you know I just want to make sure that the officials there don't feel you know I was abusing my platform yeah as a sociologist um to be honest I agree with Dr muuk especially about the causes of the underlying causes of crime uh which are both uh social economic political and historical but also we have to deal with the actual crime incidents so there's usually a relationship between the incidents and the causes for example impunity comes in when someone kills someone or commits a crime and is not caught so this means that um uh criminals then feel that they can get away with it so on the side of causes we need crime prevention making sure that it's not easy to commit a crime H discouraging the youth and other people from committing crime and then on action on incidents effective response to Crime incidents the combination of the two makes uh the crisis which were in now yeah that's exactly what I was hoping to go to next you know and many instances Scholars will tell us that people are deterred from crime not by the severity of the punishment but by the prospects of them being found and Professor mukang incidentally in the luki siki case we were told that the family that can number and attack had been mourning the deaths of two other people who were killed in a very similar fashion last year and those killers are yet to be found my question is around intelligence really whether or not in a country like ours that's you know something that we can even rely on given just how pervasive some of these crimes have been yes uh you know like uh uh Dr Trevor you know indicated that whenever there is a crime and and and those that are observers if if they foresee that the perpetrators are not apprehended and also not only being apprehended but also if then that particular case will end up in positive conviction we are here we are talking about the quality of you know utilization of resources you know from station management where those that are leading the resources are able to you know to be able to guide investigate you know the leads as well as analyze the intelligence that has been received but also in guiding you know the compilation of case doets so that whenever they are submitted you know to to prosecution then they will be able to you know yielded the required results the issue of you know crime intelligence has been a very th issue because uh for many years we have seen you know the interference of politicians within the domain of crime intelligence whereby you know people that are leading you know even those that led you know the organization the police itself you know in the capacity of ministers they will be able to deploy their relatives in that particular domain whenever you know IND individuals are confronted with a challenge you know to see that the prospects of you know career advancement is not is deem then we are talking about the you know the low performance and and crime intelligence has been you know notorious in terms of corruption as well as the allocation of huge funds and how they were not really accountable to the public in terms of you know how are they conducting their coet as well as their you know ovet operations so hence then there was that particular Commission of Z commission to say that there has to be more transparency because look at the performance of crime intelligence it's really poor and and and because of what because of how then you know that particular entity has been managed so many incidents you look up of 2021 unrest and how it unfolded you know and how you know trucks were tortured and the issues of luiki how then you know the criminals or those who are responsible for the two members were killed are not yet apprehended it is just indicative that you know the interference of politicians in the domain of policing and people that are wrong appointed in certain positions that they cannot able to perform and hence then we have a problem of trust issues in South Africa as well as you see people that are experienced in the in the in the area of Investigation in the police because the environment you know is not conducive for that so hence then we have these kinds of problems within within our societies and of course uh Dr H we know that um violence beget violence and that's certainly been proven true throughout history U the real risk that lies here is that because we are becoming so accustomed to these kinds of mass killings that we may very well get to a point where as a society we are desensitized and that may very well spur on criminals who take part in this kind of activity exactly so the keyword here I can use is normalization which you know you call a desensitization so normalization comes about when not just crime is normalized but certain you know social attributes underlying social structures economic IC structures you know poverty Unemployment uh inequality so the lives of millions of people living in Shacks or millions of Youth Without Really a prospect of improving their lives it just becomes normal and then what we are facing now is the consequences of creating such a society so Liber ation uru when we got defeated upate in 94 it was supposed to close the door to such a type of society instead we're not able to do that after 30 years of democracy those social problems of inequality poverty unemployment you know we are now living with the consequences I can call that the political economy of crime it is the type of society that we are living in actually you know yesterday I laughed because I saw vice president mashad saying in a press conference as his punchline last Point everything is well in South Africa I thought well very little is well so I just think maybe the political leaders are not really connecting or sensitive about the breakdown of the social fabric taking place on the ground yeah I I happen to be watching as well and I can ATT test to that I think it raise a few eyebrows um with other people too but you know Prof there's a real risk of what's called analysis paralysis in a country like ours you know we we can spend a great deal of time making sense of what's wrong without really getting around to fixing it perhaps as a Parting Shot you can let us in on what you reckon some of the solutions are well you you you said it well uh we have that problem so as I did indicate you know we need to be able to uh avoid the lip service uh we you know we have seen how politicians are gambling with the lives of people for the sake of public relations we need to be able to appoint you know within you know the domain of the police people that are competent you know we we we have a problem in South Africa in many institutions whether is a private or public institutions where you know people are appointed because of a blind loyalty to those that are in leadership and eventually those that are competent you know they have been put at the back and that is really you know the appointment of people you know in many spheres of you know of weather of government you know in organization it has been about that particular issue and and and whenever that we have independent thinkers in South Africa those are silenced so that is whenever appointments are made in within South African Police Service it is not about the interest of the organization and and this happens as I I did indicate to many organizations so we need to be able to appoint People based on their competencies and we need to be able to put those that are in leadership in account to be able to you know to account to the resources how are they utilizing the resources and what criteria are they utilizing to be able to check that you know in every operations every task teams that are appointed you know what is it that is a measurable and what is the required in terms of ensuring that the public are brought into confidence to say that this entity with the public money you know they are doing what is required to be done absolutely hopefully we able to get round to that rather sooner than later but Professor mukang let me thank you for your time really do appreciate your insights as well as Dr W thanks very much for spending time with us as we make sense of this huge huge problem in our society Professor Jacob muuk a criminologist Dr trevan Wan speaking to us in his capacity as a sociologist both our guests thanks very much indeed
sLwkGRHO8DI,Cape Town hosts Sea Power for Africa Symposium,2024-10-15T09:44:23Z,856,the sea power for Africa Symposium is currently underway in Cape Town that event brings together Naval leaders defense experts policy makers and Industry stakeholders from across the continent and in fact the rest of the world the Gathering itself has just gotten underway let me just uh take a quick glance to get you a sense of what might be taking place all right so Vanessa Puna is actually a reporter on the story and she'll get us a better a sense of what's taking place there now Vanessa joining us live and perhaps Vanessa you can help us place the significance of the SC because we don't always speak about the South African Navy or perhaps where we fit with the rest of the world are together aanda yes good morning to you and of course uh hosted by the sa Navy uh about 35 countries are being represented here at the sea power for Africa Symposium 2024 um just a short while ago we came out of a media briefing with Representatives including the minister of defense and military veterans as well as the chief of Navy vice admiral mob say about uh the challenges facing our Navy but also navies across the African continent and what exactly the Symposium will mean in terms of Maritime safety uh national Safety and Security as well as the protection of ocean resources uh very warm good morning to you sir um so yes we've spoken the reason why the Symposium is happening uh we've spoken about the challenges facing navies not just here in South Africa but also in the rest of the continent those challenges for us and I think finding has been named as one of the biggest challenges uh to face not just uh African na but n generally thank you very much for this question as Africa presently has a major challenge in terms of being not not not having the ability to secure our continent in the maritime domain environment so we convening here today since the last since the last Symposium was held 19 to come and and strategize and come up with solution as African Chiefs of navies in terms of how do we intensify and improve the security of the African continent because as you know all of us are dependent on trade throughout the sea 90% of World Trade passes through the African continent and 70% by volume just in our own continent now with the destabilization of Maritime trade within the Red Sea that that that trade now comes through us goes via the entire African continent so we need as African Chiefs of navies to come together and make sure that we come up with with plans and solutions as well as resources that can actually help improve the security of this region and of of the continent the issues of illegal of illegal fishing uh for South Africa alone for plus minus 6 billion R we can imagine in the rest of Africa how much that is in terms of human trafficking it also happen with our with within our continent the issues of drug trafficking happens within our our continent we need means and tools to be able ships and submarines to be able to keep Africa safe from any illegal activities that that is actually taking place within our continent so that is the main reason we are gathered here today as chief of the Navies to strategize and come up with Solutions African Solutions which are which are not dictated to by our friendly Partners our friendly Nations must come must must come and join us at Sea not us going there to join them at Sea so our governments need to give us the the the all the all all all all the resources that we re what what the South African Navy is facing in terms of underfunding it's not only affecting us it is a general cry within the African continent hence uh you find that many partners from outside the mother Africa are actually always in our territorial we want that it must be South Africa as and as well as the rest of the African continent that is taking charge of our own back yet so just in the natural um once the Symposium is concluded um is there a memorandum of understanding that gets signed uh is there a draft sort of I don't know document that says this is what has been agreed at the Symposium and this is how we carry on forward on completion of this of this Symposium definitely there's going to be a an agreement that that that will be sign that will be signed taking us forward in terms of achieving all what all what we've actually discussed in here making coming up with with plans hopefully by the next Symposium we'll be able to report back to the plary and say that this what we've agreed in 2024 in South Africa this is how far we've gone you know that we we do have Regional uh collaborations uh sadak uh as well as in in in the west coast South Africa we about to sign a memorandum of agement as well with Namibia and Angola to to to to make sure that we cooperate in in that spere there was a set Maritime security strategy that was signed in 2014 which SP which spokes exactly in terms of what we are present and what we did as as as as South Africa in the mozic channel and now come towards the end of this year I'm also deploying a m to go to to to mozambik channel to go and and continue with those with those B as you recall there was a Paris attack in 2014 uh now in 2010 South Africa came in and D stabilize that that because we we understand that should mozambik be be destabilized it will affect the economic flow to to to to to to South Africa so we need to come up with with with Security Solutions to prevent this crime from coming to our teror thank you so much for your time of course the Admiral M Lis chief of the South African Navy just giving us um a summary of the importance of the Symposium of this nature um highlighting the issue around um uh drugs uh issue uh issues around human trafficking issues around National Security not just for South Africa but for for uh countries on the continent and how the various navies can come together uh pooling resources pooling information pooling experiences uh to ensure that the safety is is achieved around the African continent right Vanessa Puna for that reporting thanks very much indeed Vanessa is live to us there from Cape Town in the Western Cape
Bp4QqlZgE3o,JSC Interviews | Judge Patricia Goliath grilled,2024-10-15T09:11:31Z,4700,acting judge president of the Western Cape High Court that's Patricia Goliath has attempted to explain her leadership style before the Judicial Service Commission in fact the range of questions were put to her yesterday on the relationship between judges and her management of that division she of course was one of seven judges vying for the Post at least that of Judge president on the bench let's make sense of what took place just about 24 hours ago bringing judge of matter coordinator Allison Tilly who's with us now via our video link Allison thanks for making time for the sabc news channel it's great to get your thoughts on these issues the Western Cape high court is certainly known or perhaps I should say is notorious for having a few issues there and it certainly had a troubled history and I suppose to be fair that's why Justice M Samaya said that they needed to be very careful about how they conduct yesterday's interviews with the benefit of hindsight um were the Commissioners able to strike the right balance just in the way in which that interview was conducted um yes I I I think so I think the interview was respectful um I don't think any political Point scoring uh was allowed and um I think the the candidates were all able to demonstrate why they should or shouldn't be uh in a leadership position um matters did did run on a bit late but um I think we certainly and and particularly in relation to acting judge president or then acting judge president um Goliath I think was really given every opportunity to deal with the challenges and and uh issues raised around her candidature yeah and of course even the day after so much of the focus as we reflect on what took place is around her and that might be because she's been acting the position but it seems there was also for other reasons you know including just the relationship she might have had with judges in the division yes and I think what particularly um Disturbed certainly some of the Commissioners was the the fact that there was a letter or submission uh from a a fellow judge in the division uh you know with the raising a range of questions and I think that was uh timbe duat toi uh said that it was unprecedented uh in his experience and I I think it that really was something that caused the JSC to really stop and think about whether this was the appropriate candidate yeah um questions now are going to be around whether or not we can finally see the division headed in the right direction given what emerged yesterday what do you reckon it will take for that to happen well I think the the there was a lot of talk about communication and it seems as though that one of the the issues is that uh the judges are not really meeting socially they're not enough uh meetings of the judges forly uh and there doesn't seem to have been a conversation about what has gone wrong and uh you know one of the first things you're going to have to do in order to fix the problem is is to get every body to talk together about what they really think the issues are and they they're they're many um but if they're not able to sit down and talk about them it's difficult to see how they could be resolved yeah can we talk a bit about some of those issues just for the benefit of people who aren't watching the situation very closely I had already a marked or just highlighted the fact that it seems relationships had soured frankly between some judges in the division that there had been concerns around minut taking for example under then acting judge Goliath um and also issues around whether or not um she hadn't necessarily told the line with the secretary when it came to how the secretary interacted with one particular judge you can help us sort of kind of flesh out how these problems manifest and you know the perhaps the potential stumbling box for the person who's been recommended for this position I'm I'm smiling because the the Chief Justice really asked the same question and and asked candidates not to tap dance around the problems uh and here I am thinking I should be tap dancing but it it look there was straight up issues around race um I think that that's been something that's plagued The Division I think it's uh it's been a difficult issue to address and one of the reasons is because it hasn't I don't think been addressed openly in constru acely so uh that has been a problem I think the leadership as we know there has been a really toxic mix uh in in that Division and uh it seems as though judge Goliath really took the view that she wanted to just keep everything in place sort of Frozen in Time a waiting for the new judge president who who will then come in and then she would sort of hand over of course she was hoping it would be herself but now uh it'll be somebody different from outside of the division uh they have been in the division before so judge mbinda bana I think uh stands a a good chance of of coming in and and being treated as somebody who's you know be able to be a new Brio that sweeps clean uh maybe it's a it's certainly a challenge uh she in in her interview she indicated she was up for the challenge so um we certainly are wishing her the best in that yeah these interviews of course if they go well could be great um they could sometimes highlight strengths that people weren't aware of but the flip side of the coin is also true if they don't go well they could be very bruising and um that might also I suppose raise questions around what happens next with certain candidates I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this question without making it personal but judge goath had I think in some instances a tough time yesterday and so I suppose the question becomes what do you reckon happens next for her well I think she has um you know a perfectly respectable judicial career uh she will not be judge president in this divis Vision um I guess she could potentially look at going up to the the Supreme Court of Appeal so that might be something that she she would be thinking about um but it's a big division it's a busy division um there are issues and and if she decided to you know really spend her career focusing on getting the division right and and supporting the new judge president um the the new judge president has indicated that she has a very good relationship uh with judge Goliath so we would hope that there would be no issues there uh you know it may be possible with a partnership between them uh to really steady the division get those relationships back on track and and do what's probably the most important thing which is to deal with the shortage of judges and make sure that cases are are dealt with quickly judgments handed down ously and and really the the reputation of of the division restored absolutely no overstating just how important these interviews are and the process itself Alison Tilly we appreciate your helping us understand more clearly why that's the case um Alison Tilly of course is a coordin a coordinator with judges matter thanks very much indeed for your time for
2_lsPlfPig4,"Gauteng DA holds media briefing on Panyaza Lesufi ""corruption coverup""",2024-10-15T08:56:25Z,32679,we promised you a briefing from the Democratic Alliance where they alleged Premier balui has been involved in a corruption cover up dating back to 2016 that briefing has now started let's listen in is lost due to corruption uh particularly in government departments and this is something that we have been saying needs to be investigated we sitting with over 58 uh forensic reports that uh you know has for the longest of time since 2016 have really not come to the fall some people had been suspended automatically they are reinstated without us even understanding where is the investigation gone what are what were the recommendations and what ultimately would have happened in that the forensic investigation undertaken by the Ken provincial government are meant to determine whether any corrupt activities have been taking place in government by releasing these reports Premier Sufi will show that this government is serious and has nothing to hide um when dealing with corruption and with the um you know clamping down on on on on Mal Administration despite the releasing of the Anglo Ashanti you would remember we had spoken about the Ang Ashanti report that spoke about almost 500 million that has been spent on an empty hospital that we never even used once but 500 million has gone into that no one has ever been held to account up to today we are now sitting with NOS that have been without uh you know resources and we are asking ourselves why money that was meant to go to these noos haven't been going to this we sitting with the Tempa Hospital report that you know the driver's license um um Center reports that that talks to a number of reports that we said needs to be um you know made public we need to then know what were the recommendations and what is actually to be done going forward I can tell you right now there is the bus um The Scholar transport um subsidy um and and the bus uh the the bus um subsidy that um the report that needs to be made public we're waiting on that to be made public the school uniform our poor kids who are in the townships who are relying on government subsidized uniforms have been robbed of those uniforms and we haven't um up to up to today been told why um um has that not happened the NOS that were supposed to be receiving millions of rents in terms of subsidies haven't been receiving their money or monies has been cut and we don't know what has been happening the investigation has really not been able to then give Clarity or they haven't been able to um you know be made those public recently also came to light um that a forensic audit launched into the hen Department of Social Development had revealed that the director of sustainable livelihoods program uh juli maposa has resigned in 2018 after he was accused of fraud of soliciting bribes furthermore the forensic audit which began in 2018 also revealed that between 2014 and 2018 a huge portion of the annual budget of the program went to three nonprofit organization that shared the same directors now these are some of the things that we have been saying if the reports can be made public we can then know what actually is happening the fact that these are not being made public the fact that pazza keeps talking about making these public and not making them public means that he knows what they contain it means that he knows what is in there the question is who is he who is he protecting is he protecting some politically aligned people is he protecting some officials that are really um high up there and doing favors you know for other politicians that now needs to then be protected why are these reports not seeing the time of day the content of this forensic um audit is still not to be are still not still needs to be made public the department plays a critical role um in the uplifting of uh the lives of the people here in C however um this cannot be done if only a connected few as I said are given tenders or are actually then given subsidies instead of the additional uh people and the processes been followed um accordingly and this is what the forensic investigating reports would be able to then uh tell us in addition a forensic investigation was meant to be undertaken into the into the conditions of the rahima Musa hospital um which is also not started as yet we were told that money as a service provider has been Pro um has been um um uh um um appointed in that particular space but nothing has actually happened in that regard what are they hiding what are they scared that this the service provider is going to find in this particular space it is also clear that when corruption occurs there's are there are only um connected few individual idual that benefit to the Departments um or out of the Departments and to the detriment of our residents here in furthermore we have been told that there will be lifestyle um audits that will be conducted and here in here out since David makura we've been told that there will be lifestyle audits they'll be lifestyle audits now again pazza seems to have jumped on the bandwagon of talking about lifestyle audits but we never hear anything about this lifestyle audits we've been told that theyve been completed yet nobody has ever seen um you know the results thereof the question is why hasn't that happened it's now 2 years that paza has made this promise of ensuring that lifestyle audits will be made public and nothing has actually come down this the LIF audits also talks to the government's drive to clim down on corruption and to clim down on Mal Administration but if they are these are not going to be done and made public it then um tells us that this is just rhetoric this is just talk and there's nothing else that is going to come out of it that will be to the benefit of the people of C corrupted activities in this province take away valuable money from the service delivery put in the needs of the residents on a back foot furthermore additional money is spent on Forensic investigation this for forensic investigation cost millions and millions of rents so it's not free of charge and it's not done in house they are getting um external companies to do this which charge um this government millions of rents and this dep this reports never see the time of day for far too long we have heard about P sufi's commitment to run a clean government but we we still waiting for this report that will tell us that this is a serious drive to drive um to to really get to um um having a clean a clean government here in running a clean government means that you need to expose corruption it means that you need to ensure that even the politicians that are connected um you know when they're implicated you are able to then investigate them thoroughly you need to make sure that charges are pressed against them you need to make sure that we we recover the monies that would have you know otherwise gone into the hands of those that would have benef Ed unly Premier Sufi needs to do the right the right thing and make sure that they release that those reports and release them with a matter of agency we need to make sure that this uh forensic um reports are released to us we are putting again another P application to them today uh we putting another Pi application to make sure that we then get this reports failure to which we will actually then uh be left with no option but to approach the presidency in this regard because we are saying that this is a matter that cannot um you know continue unabated we are going to be um you know also approaching the president as I said um to ensure that we unleash the Hawks um to come and do a a fullon investigation on the reports that have been there and we will uh not hesitate to take this matter to court as well we will be joining those that are looking at taking these matters to court as you would know that afri Forum has already jumped on one of uh the the forensic reports we are saying there's more of these forensic reports that we have uh you know um now know of and we are saying these needs to be released to us we need to know what the contents not the doctor versions of those but the full versions of these documents failure to which we will then uh you know approach um you know the the the higher structures including the presidency and actually a court of law to make sure that these are made public and that action is taken then going forward so this is what we this is where we are um one of the other things that we will be doing as well is to write to the auditor general as well because the auditor general looks at a there's a certain criteria that the auditor general uses or does um you know comply with when they doing audits we are going to be making certain information now available to then say perhaps you didn't have a look at this when you were doing your audits of certain departments we want you now to dig a little bit deeper and look at some of these elements um where we do believe that corruption is actually taking place or mal Administration is actually taking place that is something that you're not having a look at that in now um will affect even certain um you know audit comes of certain departments they wouldn't be getting clean audits if some of these things would be um investigated and looking at properly we will also um similarly also be writing to the public protector because it cannot be that you would have NOS that are denied uh you know the the the ability to help the vulnerable members of the community it cannot be that you would have um services that are supposed to be delivered in hospitals not being delivered because there corruption that is taking place it cannot be that you would have a police force that is supposed to be getting um you know some assistance from the provincial government in terms of vehicles in terms of um um um um additional personnel and they're not getting that it cannot be that you are going to have a situation where our children who are coming from uh you know poor communities who rely on scholar transport who rely on on on on buses to get them to schools are are Deni that opportunity you know to be able to then get um to school and these are things that we are going to be taking on with the public protector and hopefully all this um you know external um you know entities will be able to then assist us in getting to the bottom of the road that is taking place here in thank you very much all right uh questions yes sir obviously well if they have been released who has them do you have them does the public know what the outcomes of those forensic um reports are saying these are things that he keeps saying that he's releasing he says even the last time he's released the lifestyle audit report where who has seen it we certainly as sitting members of this legislature we haven't seen those members of the public haven't seen those and if they released then they should be somewhere on a website they should be somewhere on a public platform I challenge him to tell us where he has put those so that members of the public can engage with it B from enca um on your media statement you have outlined that you will um share some of the dam findings what are those well I'm as I'm saying to you we have now come to light of a number of um officials that have been implicated in some of these forensic reports but not uh you know some of them were suspended and now already they're back at work and these are this is information that we have going to uh to be making public or we're going to be making available to um you know to to to to the presidency when the time comes we are going to be making that available to the public protector and also to the auditor general because if there are people that are implicated have been suspended and without any process automatically find themselves back in and yet they've been on full paid suspension that t that talks about you know uh the road that is taking place here but also um there are millions and millions that are paid to companies that are doing these forensic investigations and yet these reports are not being made public so isn't that wasteful expenditure on its own and the fact that paza knew of some of these reports and actually never did anything or asked for a second opinion if you like or for uh certain uh documents to be reinvestigated so that there's a different outcome of that forensic investigation that talks to doctoring and that um you know amounts to also tempering with uh uh um with evidence or um even you know um um dealing or trying to do away with the crime that is actually um you know happened here and these are things that we are going to be talking to when we meet um with the with obviously with auditor general the public protector and whoever the the presidency will be allocating um to this particular case froms um Mr s you said um there's 58 uh forensic report more than forensic reports that are unreleased um I'm just trying to get it um just like how did you get to this number um just cuz these reports were tabled to to uh to the legislature and this true maybe um is this true maybe um whistleblowers or do um um the legislation was made a way of an investigation that was happening but then obviously um at the end the there wasn't a report that wased I just want to get clarity on how did you get to this number well to be quite um ex with you there's 170 that we sitting with and this has been coming to us through whistleblowers this has been coming through um to us through the questions that we have been asking in the legislature so they will tell you that these are the cases but they will never actually then go and give you the report so there's 170 to be quite exact and all of them um with relevant um um case number or what they call the ism number so we have 170 of this since 2017 since 2017 17 by the way all right so there you have it that's the situation as it unfolds in Johannesburg the Democratic Alliance outlining what they reckon are pretty damning allegations implicating um balui excuse me who's currently the premier of k um but they are essentially accusing him of concealing the findings of a number of forensic reports which um are yet to be released I mean the exact reasons for that I suppose at this stage are still not exactly clear but they are insinuating that by virtue of not releasing these reports BFI clearly has something to hide and therefore might be implicated in whatever might have taken place part of these reports they say speak about in part the Tima investigations we of course covered many stories around that troubled hospital and uh the claims of the corruption that's taking place there he also spoken about money that um you know was meant to be used for certain infrastructure projects which has apparently been spent but that infrastructure is nowhere to be found he's saying that um they don't um mind going to the court in fact is threatened Court action if these reports AR released saying that they're willing to have the president roped in to get to the bottom of what might have happened now timing in politics they say is absolutely everything if the da had known about this since 2016 as they claim the question I suppose becomes why release this now secondary to that is whether or not of course they're willing to lay any kind of criminal investigation and as suppose if they're willing to go to court they're willing to rope in law enforcement officials to get to the bottom of what might have happened but you'll take from that what you will if the claims though are true of course this becomes an incredibly important story and one that we will without a doubt continue to watch for you
iYSVDYVRiN8,Reflecting on the 100 days of the GNU with Mzwandile Mbeje,2024-10-15T08:36:08Z,2406,there plenty that's taken place in the new cycle centered around politics just yesterday uh we saw thec marking 100 days of the government of national Unity we've just heard from the da making all manner of allegations against bangui who of course is the chair of thec in Kang and there's been sentiments around the sacp an alliance partner of thec snubbing yesterday's event because of course of just how disc gral Dey about this government of national Unity let's try to still all of that for you help you to think through it bring in our political editor z l who's with us here in studio this morning and do we dare make sense of it is the first question um Shall We Begin with yesterday's festivities and just the Gathering itself you know I said perhaps in a cheeky way at the top of the hour that yesterday thec branded that Gathering as a celebration which boggles the mind for some people because the government of national Unity is a result of them losing an election which is not really something to be celebrated well maybe let's let's just give them a bit of credit and they actually said it's not a celebration it's a reflection right so which basically means they are not necessarily celebrating that they did not win elections but the fact of the matter is that the reality is such that they had to form a government and that government they chose government of national Unity 100 days have passed and I think we are close to 120 now they said let's reflect was the decision the correct one could we have done better and it would appear from the T isand of the president is that that was the best option at the time and it Remains the best option because he even went back to 1994 to say even when we had the majority so this is what we decided we will do just now the conditions have been different we are at 40% government has to be formed because Services must be brought to people so we have to do it yeah and yeah I suppose in some ways he did concede that as unprecedented as the election was the arrangement itself isn't um but as you also point out the circumstance is completely different people will argue that in 1994 thec had the luxury too right and in this year but but but I think the NC government has always um had one or two um individuals from the party outside of uh of its own despite having 69% 60% I think in their minds they've always had that inclusive aspect into government I guess perhaps to kind of like assist in their think because sometimes if you all belong together you may end up thinking the same way but there will be someone who will come from outside to say I I see what you guys are doing can we not do it this way so they've always had that um so yeah I think it's one of the things that is quite interesting for me it is indeed all right it hasn't been smooth sailing I think the president admitted that yesterday as well um especially because of the utterances of thep who I mentioned a bit earlier on I wonder how you reckon the party could deal with this because so far it seems the center is somewhat still holding but I sh at the thought of what might happen if the secp sentiments pick up momentum it's very interesting and I think I've been looking at the sap uh looking at their conduct and analyzing why they perhaps pronounce what they are pronouncing you can see it's very difficult for them um here is the alliance partner that needs to run government and somehow the people the sap remember these people are in Alli so they don't have to instruct each other they can advise each other but at the end of the day they remain independent so the fact that thep didn't attend those Reflections perhaps was to send a statement but at the same time iand you still have your own members in cabinet of that gnu um I mean the chairperson is part of the gnu a cabinet so yes you are protesting we understand but the fact of the matter is you are protesting protesting against something you are very much part of so what is the better option do you choose that which the PAC Advanced you remember when people were lambasting the PAC of having joined the government they say the PAC felt you know what we think we'll be better able to influence the direction within then from outside so the hcp is inside but there's a sentiment that it feels it's not really being listened to H perhaps saying the government or the ANC listens more more to parties like the da is it is it based on facts or is on perception or it's something ideologically it's something that's very interesting but uh I guess the the the meeting that is scheduled to happen which by the way was supposed to happen yesterday iand between thep and the NC but because of the events that were happening so it was somehow postponed we look to see what exactly is going to be happening and for me the other thing that has always been an issue um with the sap the reconfiguration of the alliance I think that is just a buzz weight they've been speaking about it for more than 10 years what does it even mean so they basically want the alliance which will be the center in terms of decision making but the NC has always said uh no it it it's more about really CG governing in in that way remember they still remain independent if then we decide that the the alliance is the center so which means the decisions must be decided by the alliance so somehow the anc's power is gone scp's power is gone so I guess maybe the alliance may not even be necessary you just have to be one party yeah I mean that's what it sounds like in some ways and I I'm yet to see a country where the NEC of thec is not where decisions are made for that party but anyway the SCP has also in the past spoken about perhaps running for elections themselves I wonder if you reckon that resolution might come to for and I suspect but that's my own suspicion I suspect when they lose looked at the outcome of the results and how a party like MK simply tapped into the kind of unhappiness within thec um or even the other parties and then they were able to pull off that kind of a vote and I suspect the there is that uh in thep to say maybe maybe had we offered an alternative earlier perhaps we could have been the ones so but as as I've said this and analyzing the situation looking at the Dynamics and everything else you you just make your own sums and and come up with some sort of decision um what seems to be at the center of the disagreements in some respects between thec and thep is also centered around the person who of bangaz Lui yeah um we know you know his name has come up multiple times including in that media briefing held by the da just a short while ago I wonder what we should be making of this because unless I'm just naive but I'm not quite sure if I saw this coming that you know lufi would be at the center of what seems to be disagreements between thep thec and in some ways the da as soon as iand the government um ofing was not able to create um a GPU that would include parties like the da replicating what is happening nationally already you could see the signs there that uh there is a lot that is not going to be agreed to at a provincial level so and lopi has been very uh open in fact um obvious he's not going against the the wishes of the national leadership but it's been very clear and open in terms of wanting to work with parties like the MK and the eff something that is not necessarily favored up there at the moment so given that you know um that he has to be directed by what has been agreed upon but what his sentiments and his executive feel like so those um issues are to be expected to really come I mean we've just seen the the the the the election of the mayor in in which completely excluded the da and you have seen the kinds of attacks from the da against Lui and even within the ANC I mean he had to be called to L house to explain some of his utterances so we may not have seen it coming but as soon as they were not able to follow what the nation had done so you could see something was building up and this is not the end of it I was about to ask you that exact question I mean how do you put a cap on this because if it does gain momentum um it might very well Cascade into something way more significantly threat at National level and and and you see politics um ay is that as much as you looking at the events of the now they sometimes talk about the events of the future and everyone knows that the president the current president um in 3 years he is stepping down as the ANC president so the interests UND declared as they are you can already see that some of what is happening is influenced by the interest of the future it's an interesting statement because I heard foray yesterday say it's too soon to talk about that but maybe he's also just playing politics as it work politics indeed all right zeter you're the expert thanks very much indeed for speaking to us we appreciate that L of course uh the politics editor here on the sabc news channel will certainly keep watching all of those developments for you throughout the course of the day
ZEqAK6b3pOs,Ke Zaka returns for its fifth season on SABC2,2024-10-15T08:12:31Z,464,"back on your screens on lovely so for many years stock fs and burial societies have been part of South Africa's savings culture making it possible for a group of people to contribute equal funds towards a common investment goal to educate and highlight the importance of being financially Savvy the popular TV show kazaka will tomorrow return for its fifth season of on sabc 2 at 12:30 partnering with uh First National Bank the show features real life inspiring and compelling stories about groups of people who harness financial literacy to make their lives better to tell us more we're joined in Studio by tabis masuru uh who is the executive um producer of kazaka and bongani mza First National Banks retail marketing head it's so good to have both of you in studio welcome thank you thanks for having nice to be this is such such an important program because you know when we are talking about stockfelt and educating people but in such a an energ way which we saw from the promo I love that um bongani as a bank why is it important with you to partner with kazaka so um as FNB we really believe in empowering people to change their situations obviously financially and looking at what stock Fells mean and are in South Africa we're very much about Community communal and everyone I mean if you know in South Africa chances are you're part of a stock fell you've been blessed by a stock fou your mom your aunt you know and it's just about the community but also for us it's it was quite an important realization that it's not just about the group saving but it's also where people go in order to get their own personal financial breakthroughs and we just looked at ourselves and we were like actually this is a great place to to connect with people in a real authentic way yeah and and I mean it's not this is its Fifth Season yeah so I mean this has got to tell you its popularity and how it's helping South Africans but perhaps you can give us a little bit of a like a a look into how it has helped South Africans in financial education yeah I think what we set out to do was to create a platform that makes it easy for people to understand you know what would ordinarily be termed complex Financial things like understanding interest rates what you get so that people become confident to be able to engage with financial institutions and ask the right questions but also people to accept that they part of something that's an integral part of South African communities and it's actually a vehicle that's helped a lot of people I mean it's taken people through vity I think I'm a I'm a recipient I went through v through stock faell money partly uh and it's done a lot of things I mean the travel stock fails there all sorts of things so we just help people get in touch with the right people to give them the right information that's credible and reliable yeah and that's and that's so important because you know when we when we talk about education around stockfelt this is where I want to ask you because a lot of people feel sort of okay I can't afford to join the stock fell but the question is is it for everybody can can everybody or anybody join a Stockell and the answer is yes one of the things that we've we've learned over the years is that there are so many different types of stock fails I mean you get birthday stock fails you get uh recently we metum Lai group that buys cows literally oh wow and they actually share them in quarters so you get a stock fil for literally everything and the amounts vary I mean there are stock fails that contribute 30 Rand uh there stock fails that contribute 30,000 a week so they vary so the answer probably would be a yes there is a stock fail for someone for everybody for someone it's the concept of collective I think the the driving force is the the concept of collective so so let's bring FNB into this stock fils FNB help me understand how how does it work for the bank so I think for us firstly it's about connecting with people um secondly we actually have we actually have great products that are geared at firstly stock fils um which are digital which also answer some of the problems that stock Fells are facing things like security things like money disappearing you know the the the story about the chairperson disappearing with the money our offer and our products have you know visibility for all stock fil members lots of security around it but also for the individual we offer great products for the people when we talk about financial literacy and getting people to understand how to budget they can do that on our app how to um save we've got different savings products for the individual as well as for the collective we've got things like Collective home buying we've got great first time um home loans for for firsttime buyers we have so much on offer and for us it's really about showing people how they can better themselves firstly in the communities because of the collective and the community that the stock Fells um it it just works with how South Africans are but also as individuals so for us it was when we looked at it we thought actually this is it fits because we're about help that's what our brand is about and and stock Fells at the core and at the heart of it are about help and and it just connects and the reality is if you look at the majority of South Africans bank loans seem like almost an impossibility uh because it's very very hard to access bank loans it's not a it's not a secret but it is there's got to be so much in place in order to for you to do this however through working in a Stockell and having um the the ability to go in this route where it's it's almost like a mass saving account it's much better and much easier would you say that I think I mean there's many ways to access good credit if I could put it that way um but also there's ways to access money that you need outside of applying for credit if you know what I'm saying and I think stock stock Fells do offer that but I also think stock Fells can help people to build wealth so that they can qualify for the good credit that they need in their lives yeah so obviously um I mean one asks five seasons of this you know the content I mean does it ever run dry but I can imagine with the stories that you're covering you can never run dry what are some of the most interesting stock FS that you covered I mean if you look back and say who would have thought I mean you saying you were a beneficiary in education but just in in general something that's popped up on the show and you think that's amazing I think one that stands out there are quite a few that stand out but there's one in particular it was called mercedi education group Rec covered in season 4 I think it's a group of ladies so what they then started doing was uh coming together and contributing towards building infrastructure educational infrastructure uh that would benefit the communities and then the communities because they didn't have access to credit they would then the stockfeld would then build the infrastructure and then the communities would contribute minimal amounts towards paying off that Capital amount that would have been spent by the group but this would happen over a long period of time so the group didn't necessarily see this as an investment Venture per se yeah uh they saw it as plowing back into the communities where they from where you know educational infrastructure is dilapidated and so on that's one of them I mean other fascinating groups that come out to mind is if you go toan the types of stock fails you have there they call them do social in inan and I mean the amount of cash that flows around there is Fascinating People buy cars for cash uh with these stock fils so you have Lo entrepreneurs you know vendors uh Street vendors who actually run these stock fils and they contribute this money towards buying stock collectively and the amount of progress they've made over the years I mean some have moved from being Street vendors to owning Tavern some have moved on to owning bottle stores and so on through uh participating in the different stock FS that they've had fantastic as as a bank do you help people partner up with different stock FS because and if I come to you and say I want to be a part of a Stockell but I'm an individual um I'm not necessarily a part of one already that is invested in your in your accounts or bank can you assist me so actually tabis so and I were having an offline discussion just around how we see the the show and the the the TV program as a start of something much more amazing because there's so much that we can work on together um in terms of really turning people's lives around financially partnering with Stockell creating more education creating platforms talking so there are lot of opportunities that can come in the future just around this well I mean this is our first season hopefully and I believe it will be a very successful SE and partner partnering with them Fant us never know where this is going now exactly and I I just think with what Gaga stands for and what FNB stands for and what we're looking for I really think the opport unities are are endless to be honest amazing so I mean I can see the times behind you it's here on sabc 2 at 12:30 on a Wednesday which kicks off tomorrow and then on Fridays sabc 1 at 4:30 so you know appealing to a wide audience but perhaps we can leave it here and ask you sort of some things that we can expect in this next season what what are the things you'll be focusing in on I think what we've always and this was part of the discussion I was having with is that what as we've done Gaga over the years one of the missing Loops I'd say has been you give people information and then they still need to transact so they need to engage a reputable institution towards transacting so for us this partnership is a wonderful opportunity where as we provide this financial education and people say we're interested in buying property as a collective we then able to say through our partnership with FNB there is a product that c for precisely what you're doing so for us it then means that we're providing full you know Full House support to stock fils right up until they transact in a manner that would benefit them amazing good luck good luck tomorrow 12:30 making its debut again but not for the first time this is the fifth season of this uh incredible program kazaka which is going to educate you on stock fils Tois so Mas executive producer and bongani mza who is fnb's retail marketing head part in with the program for the first time and talking to us about the return of this popular TV show"
1bMkb7oXFY4,2024 Street Lines Skate Tournament dominated by olympians,2024-10-15T08:08:54Z,196,Olympians dominated the 2024 Street line skate tournament which took place over the weekend out in the nation's capital now Brandon valala I'll get it right I'm going to ask him as well as where defended their titles respectively in an event which saw 7 skateboarders from across the country competing in the women's and men's categories now we've roped in Brandon as well as Ryan fesp who is the streetline organizer to talk about this past weekend's tournament good morning jman thank you so much for joining us this morning morning thanks for having us Brandon I want to start with you you were out at the Paris Olympics earlier on this year speak to me about how that experience was for you we know we didn't medal but just the experience and and way it takes you now in your direction arts and skateboarding most definitely um first things uh thank you for having me um speaking about the Olympics and going into that um the incredible experience this time around going into Paris where they were actually Spectators there was energy there was a crowd there was so much fun going around the whole city of Paris and also not being in stadiums and being in those beautiful venues was insane to be honest there's no words that can put it into the way that it feels you know um comparing the two of competing during Co and that um it's an honor to obviously be able to be out there and represent South Africa two times at the Olympics and seeing progression in the results so I feel hungry and motivated to go back and and keep pushing going in towards La and see if we can actually get to that final top eight spot and then battle it out for a medal the next time around well we look forward to seeing you a la come 2028 um let's speak to you now because we look at this year's tournament which you hosted participation numbers much higher speak to me about what made this time around very different from from the past and how you're feeling about the direction you're taking yeah I think uh Street lines is it's just incredible how the event has grown so quickly I mean it's the fourth year we've hosted the event um it's become the biggest skateboarding event in the country um for us it's important to have the events and have that platform for for skaters to show their showcase their skills um you know having the women's Cate women's category and the men's category so this year we had 70 skaters in total we had to cap it that amount just to be able to finish the event in one day um there was a lot more skaters that wanted to skate so we'll see how we can progress it for next year um but it's important for us to you know have have the likes of Brandon and and boy P there and give local skaters opportunity to skate against Olympians and get the the feel for competition um see what's possible um and how they can grow themselves into becoming possible Olympians one day indeed let's speak about something Brandon because you mentioned this was your second time out at the Olympics when you look at the difference in level versus the rest of the world for us as South African skaters what what kind of a gap would you say there is and how are you feeling about that and is that something that makes you want to be be more involved in international competitions most definitely so for me looking at the progression of my skateboarding it definitely did Elevate when I was on the international stage or when I was traveling to be able to compete so looking at the gap between the South African level we do have really talented skateboarders and I think it actually just comes down to having those International grade facilities that the way that everything is built is very specific at International contest that if you able to apply the tricks that you've learned to that standard and that level of obstacles um I think we definitely have the potential to have the best in the world and have Olympic gold medalist coming from South Africa but it's just going to take a bit of time when it comes down to building those facilities but regardless of that with what we have and what we do have is streets ahead the rest of Africa so I feel like we do have an opportunity in that sense and we do have really talented and really great skateboarders but to bring that Gap we will need to bring either International competition to South Africa or we need the guys from South Africa to have more of that experience going out there competing against the rest of the world cuz it's not just about being able to skate it's also about making it happen in those specific moments that you have to make it count and being able to realize that pressure is a privilege and pressure makes diamonds so that's what it com always privilege yeah Ryan let's talk about having done the event this past weekend are you feeling that there's more of a need and a desire for more high-end events such as this past weekend um I think it's hugely important to have more events like this happening throughout the year around the country um it it needs to happen not only for the sport and the culture of skateboarding but like Bon mentioned just to progress the sport locally I mean if we can have more highend events bring some International athletes in to compete with local scats and you know just progress the sport it's it's important at the same time we also need uh better and bigger facilities you know to match what what guys are skating internationally um to to show local skaters what needs to be done and what type of um courses they need to skate and Brandon I just want to ask you so you get into skateboarding firstly what does everyone in your family say is it something that they supported or is it something that were just like oh as long as you do it as a hobby and you have a real career what was that conversation like I mean so excuse me initially I played all the traditional Sports at school and I had scholarships to play the cricket and the soccer and the rugby and my brother was also a first team in his school and all the sports so we did grow up with that traditional sport kind of focus and me kind of having skateboarding as my hobby since I was really young I grabbed a board when I was 3 years old for me it was that escape that that thing I was doing for myself and that place where I was able to create my own reality and express my emotions in a specific way where there was no boundaries or limits to what I had um for me growing up it was always looking at the international guys to be able to see what I could do or what my level look like compared to theirs and I'd be on YouTube searching 9-year-old best skateboarder in the world trying to likey old exactly like trying to see if I had any competition but then it eventually just got to a point where I was just comparing myself and trying to learn these new tricks all the time um and yeah for me um skateboarding um is something that you can't really you can't really put any limits on it but having a platform like Street lines and having that competition to not only just bring the community together but also give us a platform to showcase the talent is something that South African skateboarding really needs and I suppose Ryan then leads me to my next question for the parents sitting at home and watching I mean yes Brandon was fortunate enough to grow up in a family where sport was supported for but for a young kid sitting at home and his parents are just like no you can't become a skateboarder as a profession you need to do something else what do you say to that young kid and to the parents as well I mean why not look at what Brandon and Bella have done I mean skateboarding is such an awesome sport it's got such a cool Community behind it um you know the skate parks around the country get the kids there let them have fun let them become a part of the sport which is an Olympic sport now um so why not I mean it's it's better than sitting at home on a device isn't it you touch on boy Billow are you seeing a lot of diversity coming through as well in your tournament oh definitely I mean it's a huge diversity in Street lines which is is something we really proud of I mean having scatters from all over the country uh men and women full diversity different age groups it's it's something that's important to us and something we proud of all right well thank you so much gentlemen Brandon congratulations on defending your title just tell me your surname it's Val jalo valalo I did get it right thank you so much for joining us this morning ladies and gentlemen of course being joined by Brandon valalo as well as Ryan fisp who is the street line

pzMHvWxyp6o,Democratic Alliance in Gauteng set to brief media,2024-10-15T08:01:03Z,1064,Let's uh quickly cross to um Valena where the Democratic Alliance in Kang is today holding a media conference at the Hang provincial legislature and we told this is to expose what the da says is Premier Banas sufi's role in corruption uh he is alleged to have been hiding forensic investigation reports that were undertaken by the hting provincial government since 2016 Let's cross now to our reporter who will be covering this event for us here on sabc news so very interesting the DA has been talking about this for a few weeks now and uh so we anticipate that they will be laying be the details to those allegations well certainly uh at the moment what we have information to is the fact that they are trying to apply pressure put pressure on the pro on the premier of how to release those documents forensic investigations and make them public so that they are there for all to see and it seems as though based on the briefing rather the the brief that was sent to the media there's a suggestion that you know um the premier might be worried about his own wrongdoing being exposed and this is the reason why this has not uh happened or those forensic investigations have not been made public but it seems as though they are saying that uh the findings of those for forensic investigations are quite damning and they are also saying that they have received reports from whistleblowers which we do understand uh might also join the Democratic Alliance during that media briefing but this is not where the media briefing will be held the media briefing will be held at the da caucus room which is just above us from where we are right now now this where we are is the provincial legislature and this is where everything began the government of provincial Unity uh during the first setting uh we saw the ANC and the Democratic Alliance voting together to vote to install the premiering Premier Baza lfi and also they voted together for uh the speaker of the legislature and voted for a democratic Alliance candidate to take on the position of Deputy speaker right here in the provincial legislature but that soon uh went down that relationship really ended very quickly after uh the voting in of those three key roles here at the provincial legislature we then saw saw the the resignation of the Deputy uh the deputy speaker here at the provincial legislature after talks regarding the members or the composition of the members of the executive committee here in the province did not go very well and we've heard thec and the premier saying uh on many occasions that the da left the negotiation table and decided to join the opposition bench and we are yet to find out what were the reasons for that and it seems as though they did not see eye to eyee on the composition of those and then we saw other parties then joining the government of provincial Unity the Premia of Kang having made numerous calls to the Democratic Alliance saying that they are welcome to rejoin the government of local of provincial Unity for
J3ISEd7svo4,Gauteng DA accuses Lesufi of corruption coverup,2024-10-15T08:00:07Z,7297,da inen is said to hold a media briefing centered on Premier banga Lui they alleged that lufi has played a role in corruption by hiding for renic investigation reports undertaken by the Ken provincial government since 2016 a reporter MIM T is watching those developments and joins us now live from the Hing provincial legislature in Johannesburg and by L I suppose this is a bit different right because amongst the many questions being raised is why the da is deciding to hold a media briefing about this as opposed to I don't know go to police and layer charge if there was corruption well it seems as though they want to put apply pressure on the premier before uh possibly going to the police however if you read the The Briefing or rather the in the media invite it would seem as though they are saying that there are some damning findings from some of the reports received from whistle blowers now we wonder if they will have some of these whistleblowers present at that particular briefing but the timing of this briefing uh is very uh really brings a lot of questions to mind you will remember that thec in Kang has removed a Da Mayor in the city of Twan and replaced that mayor with an actions say candidate and it you know we know that this this has caused uh some unhappiness uh between uh the Democratic Alliance and uh maybe you know some national office bearers within uh thec as you know there have been allegations that the province has somewhat uh Gone against uh the the agreements that were reached um at National level to go into a coalition agreement with the Democratic Alliance you will uh remember that there have been numerous um conversations and interviews with the Democratic Alliance Federal chairperson um and that is Helen Zilla who has spoken quite strongly uh against the removal of the mayor in the city of TW so it is quite interesting to see that you know the da is now um in the opposition benches and also trying to apply pressure for a report to then be released or forensic investigations to be released which date as far back as 2016 and you will remember that in 2016 the person who was the premier at the time was David makura and the question is why wait for so long why wait until after uh David makura vacates his office uh before releasing such information and these are the questions that we will be uh bringing forward to the Democratic Alliance and if you know this is not really um a way of you know repaying the ANC in the province or the provincial chairperson ANC provincial chairperson um for having played a role in the removal of the democratic Alliance and that multi-party Coalition in the city of 20 the timing of this briefing um begs many questions which we hope will be answered during that briefing yeah absolutely it feels like politics is just not too far from what we're likely to hear or see today and it of course is going to once again raise questions about just how stable the government of national Unity will be um given what's taking place in Hing yes certainly it seems as though you know there are there's a misunderstanding in terms of the arrangements and the agreements to enter into this a government of national Unity we know that the leader of the democratic Alliance the national leader of the democratic Alliance um has reportedly been uh on recorded gone on the record to say that the government of national Unity was an arrangement for national government and that no AR prior arrangements were made uh in regard to the provincial government as well as local government but we've then heard the the um National the rather the federal chairperson coming out to say that you know um Arrangements what's this this will what has happened in Tuan will Su the relationship at National level and so on and we've also seen other media briefings and this includes that media briefing by the Secretary General of thec fig balula where they indicated to the media that they had to they called in uh the premier to ask questions as to um what had happened but it would seem as though this there are allegations that the the reason for the premier being called into uh what seems to be a a meeting or a meeting where he needs to explain himself came from pressure they received from the Coalition partner um which is the Democratic Alliance but at the same time there's also been CR criticisms that even though the Democratic Alliance and thec and other parties including the ifp have come into an agreement to form the government of national unity and other uh coalitions in in parts of uh the country this includes uh k at in where we see the Democratic Alliance and thec and the ifp working together but you have never really heard um other parties getting involved in party matters because you know if the Democratic Alliance is able to then put pressure on thec to then um bring a disciplinary process against one of its own members this is really you know get entering into um un un un un Uncharted territories where we see um a member of another political party instructing another political party to act or or to bring about um disciplinary processes against another one of its own members I mean we do remember that in the city of ukeni that Coalition was quite turbulent and we heard at the time when thec and the eff were seemingly speaking past each other and at the time the provincial chairperson konga said that we are not one party by virtue of the fact that we are in a coalition or in an agreement or an arrangement where we have chosen to govern together we did not become one party but we remain different parties we've seen in the city of Johannesburg uh during the opening of the the streets the wiim diela Mandela Drive um the renaming of that street from William nickel to win Miga um money Mandela Drive um we saw the official ceremony uh that was held by the city of jadur and others and the eff on the other side of the road having their very own um unveiling um as the eff you know so parties within coalitions have often acted as individuals and this has also often caused uh problems and conflict but this time around it's quite different it's different in the sense that we are seeing that there is pressure from other parties or what seems like interference from another party with a coalition the Pol inner workings and the inner politics of a CO another party due to the political Arrangements that have been made at national government and as you would know we have covered uh Coalition politics quite extensively at local government level and we have seen the the the turbulence and rather the instability that it has brought about in those areas in at local government level and the disruptions to Service delivery and so on so it is quite interesting that you know this briefing comes at a time when the the mayor has been removed and if this is not by any means you know one of those negotiation tactics where you know they want to perhaps come back to the negotiation table uh we don't know but the thec in the province has U made it clear that it was the Democratic Alliance that walked away from uh the government of provincial unity and chose to joined the opposition benches and is now um unveiling some issues that it says that need to be addressed and they're saying that um during the state of the province address the premier uh promised to release these forensic investigations and it's been two months since uh that promise was made to South Africans and still there is nothing and they are somewhat suggesting that maybe they have not been released because maybe he has something to hide we don't know we are just waiting for that agree for that briefing to begin at uh 10: this morning for
iI8IgoWSVFY,JSC interviews |  It's Day 6  - Canny Maphanga reports,2024-10-15T07:49:28Z,720,the jsse interviews continue today with 10 candidates shortlisted for four vacancies in the Western Cape High Court let's go to our reporter who's covering the interviews canny mapanga I'm sure this has been such an interesting process canny but let's perhaps focus on today those prominent uh among the candidates being interviewed today well indeed good morning to you Leanne and to the viewers at home actually it is nine candidates that will be interviewed for four judicial vacancies in the Cape High Court division that follows Mr KH you may remember him earlier uh last week when he was called out for raising his hand for multiple divisions of the high courts and then he subsequently withw and only availed himself for the kadan high court division so we expecting nine of those candidates this morning from 9:00 a.m. one of which is a senior counsel I think one is also an academic as well so it'll be interesting to see if the JC is able to fill all those four judicial vacancies we saw yesterday that it was quite a marathon of interviews Leanne for the search for the judge president of the Western Cape division of the high court of course judge no was successful in her bed there where she presented quite an outstanding presentation to the JC about her vision for the Western Cape division as well as her expertise and Merit and then of course what her appointment does for the transformation targets as she is a senior judge and of course she is a black woman that will be heading into that Western Cape division this follows a series of interviews that were quite not what the public may have been expecting you saw that the acting djp and the acting judge president of that division that is Judge Patricia glith availed themselves for interviews yesterday to raise their hand for the top judge of that post that interview of judge patsha goath took about 4 hours uh to get through as they went through her leadership style and the number of issues or concerns that were raised I think when she presented her presentation to the JC earlier that morning she gave off the image that um in her acting stint which is almost two years at the wasting Cape division that she was able to stabilize that division following the forarts between her and the impeached former judge president Dr John CL however we didn't expect to see a comment brought to the four of a senior judge in that division who raised questions significant concerns about her leadership style which I think the JC took into consideration when they made that final decision of course that obviously did play a part we think in uh sinking those two interviews of the senior leaders who had been acting for the past 2 years but were unable to demonstrate to the JC how they could turn that division around also another important factor apologies when we watch those interviews is that we can still see the stain or the impact rather of the Fallout between those two former leaders is or one is still currently a leader because uh judge Patricia Goliath will go back to the deputy judge president Ro she'll support the new judge president as she leads that division but the impact or the stain rather of that four out and what it still has on that division couldn't quite get to the root cause that they are dealing with right now but there are still critical issues that the new judge president will have to IR out as an outsider coming in and lead and unite that division so that they are able to be strengthened as a division and attract more candidates to serve in that court today the focus is purely on filling those four judicial vacancies that exist and hopefully the JC is able to fulfill its mandate and uh recommend for candidates to the president to appoint the Western Cape division to not only strengthen it but to ensure access to Justice to the people of the Western Cape those interviews will be beginning at 9:00 a.m. this morning and of course Sac news will be giving you that rolling coverage when those interviews begin as we begin to draw a close to the October leg of the JC interviews
YKq_7dewfF0,Rand Water says water crisis has now materialised,2024-10-15T06:30:41Z,15394,Grand water says that the Water Crisis uh has now materialized and water storage levels AC cross couting have declined rwater has now called for Action to curtail water losses across the province the Water Crisis anticipated to worsen uh due to heat waves and municipalities are being urged to reduce the water loss by 33% but just how serious is this impending Water Crisis in Ken we have with from Rand waterer uh Miss makosi Maru and uh she is here to speak to us about their situation and just take a look from the Rand waterer perspective about exactly how this is playing out uh Makin makosi Maru is the spokesperson for rwater Miss Maru thanks so much for your time welcome to morning live thank you Sakina for having us good morning to you and good morning to your viewers let me passap with that question directly to you Miss Maru uh but but before I get to that let me just locate Rand water in this crisis so what does Rand water do and what exactly is Rand water uh responsible for all right H thank you for the question Sakina it's important for us to clarify rain water we are a b water supplier so we Supply municipalities with water in bul municipalities in 10 then they Supply residents so that's where the difference is people tend to confuse us with municipalities most especially JC water we are a bulk water supply so we purify water then we Supply municipalities which is actually a good uh distinction to make because as the bul water supplier how serious is this impending Water Crisis in Kang Province uh as far as your uh part of this is concerned in terms of supplying uh bulk water to the various municipalities the they the the challenge is really serious we have noticed that the the storage levels throughout the province they have declined significantly and we are realizing that with the ongoing Heatwave the situation would get worse so if we don't take action as red water we will actually get into a a point where we saying we are St Ling with water some areas will not have water I mean I'm talking about the three Metropolitan municipalities your city of johanes tuani and ueni those are the three municipalities that are consuming a lot of water from R water they take over 70 over 77% of our water so what is the state of play right now miss Maru uh do you at this point still have enough water to supply all of the Kang municipalities all right s it's important for us to clarify there is enough water for the province H we have been hearing people talking about Day Zero we are not even H we're not even using that those terms in in our vocabulary we do have enough water the problem is the consumption High consumption let me explain it this way we buy water from the Department of water and sanitation so we we have a license that allow us to abstruct a certain amount of water so at the moment we are over abstracting so it means we are actually the demand is is quite high if you have to compare that with the supply so we are TR trying to alert communities and municipalities to say if we don't do anything about it we will not be able to to prevent the impending disaster or crisis that is looming so how exactly does it work uh you know when you talk about this overc consumption because when municipalities draw water how does that allocation allocation work and how do you actually as the bulk supplier go about supplying water to the various municipalities is there a formula uh you know is there an allocation for each specific municipality and if they do how is it that they get to go over their prescribed allocation okay how it works is we we have an agreement with each and every municipality obviously we look at the location how big H the demand we agree at the beginning of the year we sign a contract so now we would Supply that water at the moment we are as I'm saying we are over abstracting because municipalities are demanding more water from rain water so we are also now over the limit with the department so from us abstracting from the river water system yes we are able to obstruct but now we are left with no choice because there is one we are having physical losses that could be why we are having a high consumption we are also having illegal connections that's where the challenge is so these illegal connections uh would these be happening in the municipalities themselves and not necessarily from your bul water supply yes definitely they will be coming from uh municipalities from H RW site our our pipelines they quite big so we we will be able to see if one there is illegal connection if there are leaks and you'll recall Sakina about a month ago we we undertook a a a a project where we were conducting a maintenance a thorough maintenance so from rwater site one we are able to purify water we are maintaining our infrastructure but we need help from municipalities respective municipalities that we are supplying so that we are able to distribute water to various municipalities so so let's just clarify uh for the municipalities in case they still don't get it as you say we're not quite at the point where we're talking day Zero but there is a problem so how soon could the water be depleted if uh the provinces municipalities actually do not urgently deal with with the Sky High consumption and of course the many leakages in the systems all right Sakina as R water one we will not allow our reservoirs to be depleted completely because if the system collapses then there will be a challenge with our system there will be a problem so what we are going to be introducing in the long run if municipalities are failing to introduce restrictions we will bring in restrictions as run water to say now that you have failed as municipalities we are going to come in and introduce restrictions so that our system does not collapse and and are you finding that the municipalities are responsive to your warnings about the high rates of water consumption in the province at the moment I would say some of them are not responsive s we we had meetings with municipalities we wrote letters we recently we had the the couting water in bizo where we were actually alarming and actually warning municipalities to say if we don't make changes if we don't come up with a viable solution to address the high consumption then we are going to have challenges we don't see any changes the consumption is still high and we know that from spring up until end of summer it's a high season it's a high peak season for us so we are realizing that as compared to our to previous years the consumption is still going high then we are left with no choice but to take further steps to protect the system from a total collapse and and as you know we at the moment we are currently coming to the end of a heat wave uh that we've seen and felt here on the Hang um High Feld and there obviously will be more we we just getting into the warmer months uh here in South Africa so besides putting pressure on local water authorities to change their ways which you say some are not heeding uh maybe perhaps before I go to the the next part of the question are you able to tell us which municipalities are not complying because if they are not then maybe we need to speak to the consumers the people directly about becoming Water Wise all right as I indicated the the three metros that's why we having a challenge the reason why we're having a challenge is because the bulk of our water goes to the three Metropolitan municipalities but there are other small municipalities where we are realizing that there are huge physical losses for example mulen we are losing a lot of water through mulen on top of that the the municipality is not even able to pay rain water so we are still supplying them with water on top of that we are not even being paid for the service that we are providing so those are actually it's a number of challenges that we are facing as as a of organization so we actually making a plea to say one we still get need to be paid two we need to protect the system from collapsing three we need to educate the the public meaning the residents in terms of conserving water but also we are not blaming residents second I need to clarify that because there have been reports that we are blaming residents we are saying the consumption is high and it could be attributed to a number of problems I'm talking about leaks that not being repaired I'm talking about failure to enforce bylaws by municipalities also I I mention illegal connections so it's it's a number of issues that are actually really contributing to the high consumption and uh just finally before we run out of time uh the six month maintenance shutdown and uh maintenance project of the luto Highlands Water Project has that exacerbated the water problems that we are seeing in any way Miss Maru not at all Sakina let me just put a hting residents and and other residents that we are supplying other provinces that we will not be impacted by the maintenance of the lutu Highlands project if we run out of water from our system where we withraw water from the Val we still have the St fontain Dam where we'll be able to get water so that is not even a problem that is not even on the card so we we are not even worried about the the the maintenance it has to happen so that we are able to draw more water from the L Highland project so that is not a problem at all the problem is the high consumption just to give you figures s if you have to compare South Africa with the the world average in terms of the consumption we are using 237 L per person per day in South Africa if you compare that with the world the world is using 173 L per day per person so that should tell you how much water that we are consuming it is quite significant and um we were saying earlier in response to some of our responses to the question of the day the fact that South Africans seem to forget that we are a water scarce country uh again you know you you've tried to impose and and and and just make sure that we understand that particular matter but as far as the leakages are concerned in the municipalities do you know what the situation is currently in Kang in terms of how much water we are actually losing as a result of leakages in the various municipalities um look we we supplying a number of municipalities so we looked h on average we saying we are losing over 40% in housting so that's a lot of water second it's almost half of what you are purifying so we purify water we send it through our pipelines to various municipalities it does not even reach the residents so that's is where we're saying it's high consumption one could say is it really high consumption or is it just the leaks we need to really say to municipalities take care of your infrastructure ensure that you also inculcate the culture of water conservation to avoid running out of water and to ensure that we save water for the future generation well M Maru we have to leave it there thank you so much for your time and the clarity provided on this and I think it is absolutely shocking that 40% of water is lost through leakages and if you go through other municipalities across the country that number is even higher U which is really something that needs to be address U Miss makosi Maru from Rand wat spokesperson there speaking to us about um the Water Crisis and uh talking to us about looking at our water consumption and making sure that we comply as well well as the authorities
TKSiZ_oivfo,AFCON Qualifier | Super Eagles boycott Libya clash - Emeka Enyadike weighs in,2024-10-15T06:02:41Z,8301,Nigerian players have arrived home and are boycotting tonight's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya after being stranded at an airport for over 12 hours the super Eagles players and star flew out to Libya on Sunday night but were diverted to Al Abra airport instead of their original destination of Benghazi airport which is over 200 kilomet and 3 and 1 half hours away from where they were staying to talk about this incident with roben football journalist mea and Yad EMA a good morning to you thank you so much for joining us this morning good morning and uh hope you you're having a good day EMA let's speak about this situation because we see the Nigerian team and the fa up in arms over what has happened on their travels to Libya but we also know that we heard similar complaints coming from the Libyan team for that first leg clash as well as with South Africa earlier in the year with World Cup qualifiers the team traveling over 8 hours arriving at the airport until the airport's now closed they can't take off to their destination let's speak about these incidents because they seem to be somewhat of a regular um occurrence yeah I think what has happened uh you know with this Nigeria Leia game and and also previously with with the South Africa game um it's you know it's so 1990s this is the kind of thing that used to happen in the '90s where teams used all kind kinds of practice to frustrate the opponents especially um with the Rival times and then you have the scenario where um it could be be better if there's better coordination and there's very very specific Rules by C around how these things are done um it's football on the one hand but International Aviation has its own rules um sometimes you arrive at an airport you know have I've traveled to to Out of Africa 54 countries I've traveled to close to 50 of them because of one football or sports related event and one of the things that that I've observed sometimes is that we don't treat ourselves well well in Africa and so when a team is arriving sometimes we have Superstition so the visiting team doesn't want to let the home team know when they arriving because they feel like someone will put something you know miy or something somewhere uh sometimes they also don't they want to mind games but when it has to do with Aviation there it's not football rules it's about International civil and also National Security rules so you must let your opponents know when you're arriving Arrangements have to be made communicated Sometimes some airports don't open at night and you want to arrive at night they will divert you somewhere but this particular incident seems like a forart thing because the libyans complained last week I from Pak in Nigeria where the libyans and South Africa landed in Pak when they came to U ordinarily without uh all of the hustles that you have today which uh it shouldn't be more than an hour and half by by road which technically um wouldn't be a big problem but the thing is that U has an International Airport which means invariably that if proper arrangements are made the flights should arrive but in some countries the civil aviation rules usually for flight flights coming in mostest land in a major airport sometimes Legos or which is the much bigger airport and in the case of Libya Benghazi is a much bigger city than where they took them to so this was clearly um a case of of Libya trying to pay back Nigeria and I I think it's very distasteful it takes us really really back to the '90s because this was what used to happen to African teams and clubs going to play in Africa and I think it's very very it's condemnable on all all counts but it doesn't matter whether it was Nigeria would did or Libya but now we have a scenario where a game is not being played and to be fair to the players you can't have keep players in the airport for 15 hours and expect them to play a game the next day doesn't make sense I think you so right in what you say me that irrespective of the direction that it happens it shouldn't be allowed to happen as you mentioned that Libya did have similar concerns last week going into their encounter and now it's almost a tid fortat situation but let's speak to the possible sanctions we could see coming out of this because the Nigerian team has said that they will boycott that qualifier tonight what could possibly be the outcome of this do they then forfeit the three points of the encounter um does Libya instead as a fa get um some sanctions imposed on them what do we likely see um happening in this scenario well I think what will happen is care will investigate but you know the the the reality is that you know I I personally do not think that it made sense for the players to go and play a match after what they went through and also remember that there are issues with with with FIFA and the European clubs um insurance and all of those kind of things you know you risk having I mean we have like fer now not playing uh for for B because he got injured so we are things to consider the security and safety and also the the the health of the players very very important so getting them to play is one thing the other challenge that they have is that there are very few International Windows available the windows available is only in November which means that you are not allowed to play three games during the international window which means that this game is now a problem in terms of free scheduling but the ideal scenario would be would have been to um for C to reschedule the game um at a later date but all the qualifiers have to be completed um in November so that they'll have the draws for for the afcon done in in in uh December because by the next International window in March and June next year there is the work of qualifiers which have been suspended which have to continue so finding a date for this game will be a problem because clubs W most of the players for Nigeria play in Europe in fact all of them in Europe um so and and a few in South Africa maybe two of them in South Africa so the question is you know where do you find the window because FIFA has clear International Windows there's one every month for the I mean for the months of September October November and none in December so scheding this game will be difficult and it has to be done by the end of November otherwise you can't get the teams qualified for half so it's a very very tricky scenario and something that we have to fix in Africa we are just we keep putting ourselves in the food because the media coverage for this is a disgrace not just to to any one African countries to all of us in Africa because it's it paints a very bad bad picture and and fits into the narrative and stereotype that we are incompetent we cannot manage our game and I think it's for me I followed the game a long time and this is very unspeakable indeed it is well meca thank you so much for your time this morning we'll just keep our ears on the ground and see what the outcome will be then from caps plenary board who are currently investigating the matter that is of course in Mecca andya DK who is a sport journalist joining us to speak about the happenings out of course in Libya

1WDhsLfIAB0,Orange Farm Shooting I How do communities protect their children? Brenda Madumise-Pajibo,2024-10-14T23:04:32Z,1998,now the community of donga informal settlements in orange farm are calling for strict regulations on taverns in the area after seven people were shot dead in the early hours of Sunday morning amongst the deceased is a three-year-old child the incident has put Spotlight on child safety concerns in South Africa following incidents where women and children have been involved in the mass murders we are going to be getting some reaction now from Advocate Brenda madum pajo who's the director for wise for Africa a very good evening to you Advocate um very concerning indeed as we listened to the reactions of a mother's uh mothers who've lost their children feelings of helplessness as we take stock of something that is becoming more and more prevalent what is your reaction to this listen I think the the state of violence in this country we cannot overemphasize the stge of violence in this country it has been with us for the longest of time and it continues unabated right um and there interventions there are um programs that are put in place you you you expecting that law enforcement will will act swiftly but I think at the core of all of these things is us as Citizens as residents as individuals what is what what role are we playing to ensure that we have a violent free country right why do we believe that to resolve conflict to resolve arguments is through through violence and that you will meet the most brutal uh violence and meet it out on children and on defenseless and vulnerable groups so for me at the at the core of all of this is a real introspection as as as as human beings that we we are we comfortable in living in a society in in a community that is ravaged by violence and we want to place blame on alcohol and everything else when we don't look at ourselves and understand why it's important to Value another life and value our own lives and I think until such time that we understand the value of life and why is it that we need to be on on on on on led to ensure that we do not one celebrate violence when it happens and and and justify and excuse and give reasons why it has happened and why why why there are justification towards it we'll continue to have these discussions and debates and have more lives been lost precisely because we are not self- introspecting and and and and looking at what role can I play to ensure that I have a violent free country and a violent free community it's interesting you you speak about the role of community members when we're listening into the package just played we heard um community members speaking to some of uh from sabc news reporters saying that the suspect who has claimed the lives o of the victims was one who was unsuspecting in terms of behavior behavior and conduct and they could have never imagined that it would be such an individual and of course uh we we're also talking and emphasizing that children have now more and more children have now become victims of uh Brazen and ruthless sometimes very well organized shootings how do communities protect their children and it goes back to what I I raised earlier on I think why do we value life why do we have H why do we believe that um our children need to be protected so when we we we we go back to those fundamentals why we we we have children and why it's important that every child lives in a free caring Society a society that exposes values of Integrity of respect and of of of love so if we don't do that and continue to shower children with love and ensure that they are removed from harm and when we know that there is harm and we recognize that harm we remove them from that H and isolate the people who are causing harm what we tend to do in this country is to celebrate people who cause harm to others and and and and harbor people who have caused harm to others we we we know of incidences of people in communities who know who are perpetrators of he this he um brutal uh crimes and and violent crimes but we not willing to come forward to ensure that we really and truly live in a violent free free society and and communities so for me where I am and my frustration is that you do not have people who have a stake in ensuring that their lives are one that are free from this violence and and that they don't need to live in fear in their own communities because they have got nowhere else to go and and I I really want to plead with ourselves as as as communities as individuals what role are we playing to ensure that we we live in in in in communities and in the areas that we can be we we proud of and feel safe in and what role are you playing I'm going to emphasize we all play a role in encouraging with violence or encouraging that we we live in a space a safe place so it has to take all of us to stand up in that Community to ensure that we it's it's a crime free society and and C free community we we can't be looking for messiah from outside to come and help us when we know who are people in those communities who are brutalizing communities and and this kind of behavior and these alarming incidents often uh and always have a ripple effect in terms of affecting uh people who may feel that they are now vulnerable how do you reassure children that they are safe how do you validate their feelings that what has happened will not happen again because that in itself speaks to the psychological impact of these U Relentless killings you can only validate uh the the the aspirations and and really validate the children's fears by acting in in in such a way that they can believe that you've got their interest at heart as long as you you you they see you in in the community not doing the right things and and children are very perceptive right they can see when something is wrong and they can see when an adult is is actually encouraging that kind of of behavior you can only get the confidence of the children they we can only get their their respect and even the their the trust from them once we act and show that we are not tolerant to violence and that they they are priority in Us in ensuring that the violence will stop we can only do that by showing them we are not going to talk ourselves out of it by just continuing to talk but it's about acting and and showing them so that they can see it and they they can they can feel confident and trust that things will change very well thank you so much for weighing in on this discussion and speaking to us this evening of course rounding up that conversation with uh the uh director for wise for Africa Advocate Brenda matum pajo

V3V6yYjkasE,SA slams attacks on Lebanon -  Thembisa Fakude weighs in,2024-10-14T22:29:01Z,413,"welcome back thanks for staying with us South Africa says Israel's bombing of Lebanon is a serious violation of the territory of a sovereign state and a grave violation of international law the department of international relations and Corporation says the International Community cannot afford to remain indifferent it says 22 civilians were killed and 117 injured when Israel hit Central Beirut on Thursday departmental spokesperson chrisen Peri says Israel continues to violate International humanitarian law with impunity in Gaza South Africa condemns the bombardment of Lebanon as a serious violation of the territorial Integrity of Lebanon and international humanitarian law Israel has launched ground incursions in southern Lebanon on the 30th of September where 10,400 peacekeepers are deployed under the command of a Spanish General according to the official Lebanese figures nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since October 2023 a senior official has told the United Nations security Council that the safety of 10,400 un peacekeepers is in Jeopardy according to the United Nations official the Israeli forces have deliberately fired on positions where they are un peacekeepers South Africa underscores that this attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation for international humanitarian law right let's uh bring in some analysis with Tim safak who's a senior research fellow and director um afid to weigh in on the latest developments in the Middle East a very good evening to you thank you so much for your time uh South Africa is condemning the bombardment or of Le Lebanon of course joining in the likes of Britain uh Italy France Germany which are calling for an immediate stop for the Israeli attacks on the UN nation's uh peacekeeping mission in Lebanon I mean what how do we reflect on the story because the calls keep coming in for a stop and uh it seems to be continuing yeah this is a very Rogue government under the leadership of Benin n who wants to kick the K down the road um waiting for the elections in the United States and hoping that Donald Trump will win the elections and Donald Trump likely to favor his style of politics so Israel is violated every single little every single law um that uh is available at the moment they've gone on to violate International Air spaces of Lebanon and the Integrity of the country uh in pursuit of Hezbollah so they're doing as they please at the moment they've they've got at least seven fronts uh in terms of who they're battling um and bombarding their way through with the hope that of course all of those that are being bombarded at the moment will submit to Israel's um Israel's demands but it doesn't look like it the Rockets uh continue to land in Israel not withstanding their multi-billion R um uh defense uh system so it's very tough at the moment and it's I don't see any way out not understanding what you've just said in terms of countries calling for ceasefire but Israel is dug in its Hills and it's continuing its bombardment of Gaza West Bank and and Lebanon yeah because what's happening is the development of the genocide process in Gaza and the uh calls have been for the International Community to move in to stop the aggression I mean I I know you've just said that um you know the likelihood um you know is quite slim at this point especially we we are seeing that the Israeli aggression is spreading and it needs to be stoed what is the approach that has been taken by different members of the International Community I mean South Africa has an entire court case but how are the others weighing in well others are weighing in through the multilateral engagements mainly at the United Nations security Council and the general assembly which has not been able to stop the Israeli aggression and bment of Gaza and West Bank and libanon so that's where most of the deliberations are taking place but there's only one party here that can stop Israel from continuing with this bombardment of Lebanon and uh and palan and that is the United States of America because the United States of America is the country that's providing the where withal for the Israelis to continue doing what it's doing so if the Americans stop supporting financially and militarily uh Israel Israel is likely to stop what's currently doing in the region but as long as you have the United States that continue to support um Israeli aggression in in in both Gaza and the West Bank and now in Lebanon you are likely to have P who uh continuing doing what he's doing because he knows of course that when it does circles is likely to go to jail because he's facing a lot of troubles and legal challenges within Israel uh and having said that there's a Contin a continuation of protest within Israel but even that is currently falling on De ears and Ben when is doing Alliance within the kinet continue doing as they wish and and what does this mean for The icc's credibility if we take stock of of the kind of impact they've had on this development and and I would also like for us to touch and perhaps expand on what you said about the US and the likelihood for those November elections should Donald Trump win and you know um how imperative those elections will be as the ripple effect to what shapes the middle east's future well there are two processes the moment icj and the IC icj is against Israel and IC is against two um Ben and his defense minister you have Galant including some of the Hamas leaders including yakar Who is credited and invented Commerce with what happened on October the 7th so those processes are going on icj's going to be a long long process we are likely to see the result of that uh after the 10 of B but the IC of course is likely to continue and those charges when they are formalized Ben Gant are likely to uh be restricted in terms of their movement around the world because wherever they go it's going to be the same as what happened with Omar Bashir of Sudan and Vladimir Putin who will be forced all the world will be forced to arrest them at least those who signatory to the Roman statute now you have the American elections coming up and um Donald Trump who has openly supported benamu and who has supported these current Inc casions in Gaza West Bank and and Lebanon including him saying that he will solve and deal with Iran and invented commas so uh Benin is hoping of course that if Ben if if Donald Trump wins he is going to support him and if he does support him Ben will get basically a blank check to do as he as he pleases in the region especially in light of the inability and unwillingness by countries in the region to act to stop the barage that we're currently seeing on our TV screens whether it's in Lebanon or west bank or Gaza perhaps Let's uh look at another matter closer to home uh Tima where you spoke about the impact that the dismissal of aubert babella will have from his position in the NEC on thec putting a spotlight on South Africa's policy uh foreign policy once again I mean what after effects are we likely to see as a result of that move well this pertains to South Africa relationship with Morocco we know thatc has uh given it support for the people of Western Sahara and um Morocco is Accused by the ANC of being a colonizer and orber Bella went apparently uh on his own um he went on a family trip to Morocco but whilst in there he led a delegation that met with a political leaders in Morocco and he went to utter certain statements which offended thec particularly Nana who is OB Bella's boss and that's why he was fired but many people really do believe that there is a need for a reset in terms of relations between South Africa and Morocco while South Africa continues to support the people of Western Sahara uh but the economic benefits that could uh come as a result of s afca normalizing relations or resetting pressing the reset button between Morocco and South Africa are huge we had the president tonight outside L houses they were celebrating 100 Years of the gnu talking about a new form of diplom which is trade diplomacy Morocco has got um those opportunities and already some countries I mean some companies in South Africa that are benefiting from that relationship including Sun so if we are going to have this normalization of relations in invented Commerce with Morocco you are likely to have an economic boost in this country which is something that you all need and I think the foreign policy regarding Morocco should really prioritize our national interest and that National interest is business uh trade with Morocco would certainly help the unemployment in this country and um I think the ANC made a mistake by swiftly and harshly uh booting out Bella not understanding of course that you know there's that normal relationship that's supposed to be going on between the two countries and some of us did not really see anything that offensive that that could have led to uh to that decision that was made on Friday against OB Bella very well thank you so much for speaking to us this evening Tim safak who's a senior research fellow and director of aphid weighing in on the latest developments in the Middle East and also touching on factors here at home"

MaUdtRc4t9I,Politics Wrap I GNU marks 100 days,2024-10-14T21:57:40Z,3513,welcome to another segment of politics rap with me Natasha Peri of course a while back a while ago we saw ANC president s ra posa just reflecting on 100 days of the gnu and uh today in studio I'm joined by the sabc's political editor Mand and Via our Zoom link I'm joined by Professor breakfast gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on the politics this evening thank you so thank you very much for me Natasha Z because you're in studio let's just start off with you so you heard the president speak you heard his reflections of the gnu mentioning the successes of the gnu electricity being one of those marking 200 days of no load sheding what do you make out of this well Natasha I think you would um expect um the president of thec which is the largest party in the gnu to obvious be the one H who will then um speak about the message of the gnu as the gnu it must be seen to be working remember when they first conceptualized this and everyone was watching what's going to happen was it going to be a coalition minority government Grand Coalition or a GNU so for thec and for the president it makes so much sense that he is the one who then says the decision we took a couple of months ago was the correct one and that's why you had him mentioning some of the things really that seem to be positive particularly when you look at the economic sentiment currently I mean you've been having some green shoots really that are promising I think the test is how sustained those will be and then of course I think one of the easiest thing that is visible to everyone is the issue of petrol I mean it's been going down to the benefit of everyone so the president will and and also um articulating the fact that their priority um obviously is in job creation inclusive growth but also making it a point that as much as it is the gnu it is thec lead Professor breakfast let me take this conversation to you also heard the president um president Raposa saying that the gnu should not be judged by which political party um is a part of it but what can do for South Africans yeah I think the president was trying his level best to to Showcase to us that there's no gap between the the gnu and the the manifesto of the um ANC and that the ANC is in charge of this Arrangement and also I think in the light of what has happened in terms of the attacks that the president and other people who are leading this project have been getting I think he was trying to justify what was the rationale behind uh constituting this government and that the NC is trying its level best to achieve its objective realization in terms of reducing inquality poverty and um er unemployment of course the interesting phenomenon is the fact that um the sap stayed away from that event in opposition to the uh gnu so it's going to be interesting how these tensions are going to play themselves out my reading of the situation is that the session debate has started because you can see that um people within the NC are pulling in different directions and um the tension is not going to H deescalate I think it's going to escalate I mean I was watching the other leader of the uh Communist party on a different Channel saying that they think that the gnu is a proxy of international capital and that the aenc made a strategic Mistake by joining forces with the da so I don't think that the Communist party is going to H back down until their demands are are met and talking about the Communist party today we spoke to the ANC Secretary General Mr fig balula and of course he had indicated that the General Secretary of the sap was the one who actually asked for postponement of today's bilateral meeting of course a new date will be said but how do you see those discussions panning out seeing that the sap was critically um you know or was critical rather of the gnu well the Communist party is concerned about its own constituency which is the working class you must remember thec is a broad church and it's a contested a Terrain but at the same time the these two political parties are not new I mean when gear was rolled out there was a big tension between the Communist party and the uh in 2007 here in thep took a position to swell the ranks of the um ANC but the challenge is that the sap sometimes it comes across to be applying double standards because on the one hand they are protesting against some of the decisions which are made by the ANC on the other hand they are also serving in cabinet as ministers in a government that one can iuse led by the ANC which H backs the question as to um where do they stand in terms of these issues when it suits them they want to benefit when it doesn't suit them they want to criticize um thec so um another thing that came out today earlier on we heard the ANC Deputy president um talking about a clearing house structure now this is a new structure that has been set up in the gnu and of course the deputy president will be heading this uh structure they'll be meeting this Thursday in Cape Town and this structure is basically for gnu Partners to raise issues contentious issues that they don't agree with to actually solve those issues and of course like we can expect part of The Bella act those two Clauses and the nhi in its current form will be discussed how do you think this meeting will pan out and I think one of the things that um um we heard from the president and particularly from thec um is that they really want to project this gnu as working and working for everyone the fact that um they have as parties that are part of the genu have decided that they need to have a structure which will then be able to deal with the the issues I think one of the things that the deput president Natasha said as well which I found very interesting was that it's not only going to be confined to issues where they disagree but it's going to look at the national issues as the country we are said to host the G20 next year already those issues will be on the table so they are basically want to be as inclusive as possible to bring everyone on board so that everyone will feel part of what is happening there are very critical voices to this gnu I mean even the alliance partner I think the Prof has made it clear particularly when you refer to to people like the the sap but the but the fact of the matter is that you have set up this structure you want to make it work and then you are doing you are putting all the elements that will make it work and I think it will perhaps go some way in terms of um identifying some of the issues that may be problematic and the fact that they are actually bringing the parties to discuss the issues of national importance I mean the hosting of the G20 is is Big remember you are bringing um the the presidents of the world of the First World countries um it's a huge thing Prof um how would you define uh this clearing structure and I think um the work of this clearing structure how important will it be in dealing with such issues like M highlighted and as well as contentious issues yeah just to build on what has said um Coalition formations have been unworkable and unstable so um it's good to have a platform for Coalition Partners to to articulate their H disc condem remember Coalition formations are are drawn from International best practices you know the the the the conception of coalitions was foregrounded by Arend Lim Fant so in countries like Germany France no way this is what they do uh when they have H disagreements they sit around the table articulate their views and and not collapse the the government as it has been the case at local government level so I think this will uh deescalate some of the the tensions I mean the um controversial bills which are in the pipeline the the Bella Bill there there are some sections which were put on hold which have not been signed off um also the issue of nhi and other bills that might be introduced so I think it's it's really a wonderful um idea in terms of making this genu to to flourish but also in the bigger scheme of things I think there are other threats which are are posing a danger to the the genu but from my standpoint I think it's a step towards the right direction okay Z before we actually close off uh just on on the backdrop of what the prophet said is the center holding in the gnu you you heard um Deputy president Paul M saying there are no quarrels in the gnu contrary to what has been put out in public but I mean previously we saw the spat between Baza Sufi and the DA's Helen Zilla recently um the the provincial Secretary of the K at of K also entered the fold what's your reading into this well I mean in short I think the people who are currently Central at the gnu so I would give them credit it's still holding and and most of the noise that we hear are people who may be outside um like the persons that we have just mentioned so far they are it is still working but I mean no one expected it to be a smooth ride I mean this is a New Concept for us as the country and then then of course we've always known that these parties differ in terms of their approach so far so good I guess um the test is the sustainability and durability of it all and uh like the deputy president of thec Mr Paul mhaa had said that this GNU is going to last it will last um and perhaps if actually go over the 5 years that it's supposed to well no no no remember the term of office is 5 years and then it has to end and then they have to go back to the voters if then it's the same thing so they can either craft something similar or the Coalition or perhaps one party will be able to win outright which I think the parties that's what the parties will want but the fact of the matter is that if you look at this gnu how it's it's it's how it's structured so chances of it lasting very high because even if one of the major parties were to pull out so it will still hold and remember there are those outside waiting to come in okay gentlemen thank you so much uh for your time that was of course Professor breakfast and politics editor here at the sapc just giving their various insights uh and Reflections on uh the gnu which has marked 100 days of course we saw the da as well reflecting on uh the gnu uh last week Friday vir sabc actually covered uh you know extensively but what we can look out for uh this Thursday is that a structure there the Clearing House structure will which will be chaired uh by the deputy president Paul mashad to actually talk about contentious issues within the gnu and where uh you know gnu Partners don't actually find uh common ground with of course uh this is all that I have for the politics rep I will be back on Friday we're going to go to the weather and I leave you to the capable hands of oo and she'll be back with you at the top of 10

Jf83r-_aj40,JSC Interviews | Track record of candidates & Reforms: Sinawo Makangela weighs in,2024-10-14T20:22:10Z,993,now as the Judicial Service Commission searches for the next judge president of the Western Cape High Court division the leadership style of the current acting judge president Patricia Goliath has been called into question she's the first candidate to be interviewed for the role a position previously held by Dr John Cloe who was impeached from the office by a majority vote however judge Goliath who is a few months short of completing two years as the acting judge president saw concerns surrounding her leadership style in what has been described as a troubled division thrust into the spotlight in response judge Goliath refuted the allegations put to her by the JSC we get some reaction now from legal analyst s ma kangela who joins us via video link to weigh in on the interviews very good evening to you thank you so much for your time I mean this is the first JSC chaired by the new chief justice Mandisa Maya although she was previously a member of the JSC and has chaed the JSC on several other occasions in retired chief justice Raymond zondo stad but it's the first time really where she's firmly on the saddle in her own right what stood out for you during these interviews well thank you for having me good evening to the viewers as well I think she's managing the processes very well she's firm you know the allocation of time to the Commissioners what must be asked to ensure that the decorum of the process is maintained but it remains respected and it delivers the desired outcome which South Africans can be proud of I think she's steering the ship very nicely for for the past week as we've observed we know that after the May elections uh Parliament replaced seven of its 10 Representatives on the JSC which uh make up a third of the 23 body uh member B so there have been some big changes what role do you think the MPS need to take in this process more so as U the this round of interviews is deemed as one which will shape South Africa's Judiciary amid some of the political tensions in fact these interviews are not different from many other interviews because all the JS interviews are feeling the vacancies of the judicial officers so the process has to be above board the process has to be transparent the process has to conform with the laws the process has to be observed and respected by Everyone by everybody that as a duty to deploy its own representative to to that Forum so the issue of the culture of the jersey and what is expected in terms of the Constitution it has to be maintained so as I say they are not different from any other interviews remember she was interviewed by the JC in that period it was very important it tells you the standard but there will always be interests different interests uh according to the times in the JSC so now I I ask you this as there there have been some growing calls for the reduction or even the removal of parliamentarians on the JSC but but one can also argue that they also provide Democratic legitimacy to the entire judicial appointment process well the the composition of the J is in terms of the Constitution yeah so surely if there is such call it will have to undergo the Constitutional Amendments but otherwise as it stands all the representatives remember it's a body that represents everyone public Representative members of the executive members of the Judiciary the academic Representatives the law bodies so it caters for a conglomerate of bodies so surely if there are any calls for the reduction then it me those people are making they have to make their calls in the right platforms that is in Parliament so that the constitution can be amended accordingly yeah and of course I mean the big um talking point was that of acting judge president of the Western Cape High Court Patricia Goliath I mean she faced some really tough questions from the JSC from her leadership style coming under scrutiny and uh what has emerged that she sought to recuse the um nor J as as a JC commissioner for the judge president interviews what is your assessment of that entire interview well it's tough remember she's the incumbent so the advantage with other candidates is that they are not occupying the seats already there is an assessment of whether she's suitable or Not by looking at the track of the road that she has traveled thus far so already the JS has the benefit of assessing her leadership from what she has been doing and remember a leader you will always have some brushes with some in some corners but then again your weakness is get to be exposed at this early stage so as you could see it took a longer period of time and the Chief Justice at shed allowed the questioning of her because it's important this position also there's an agreement and unanimity that there are issues in the western C even candidates will keep on coming that they say there's a problem in the Wern C people on saying there's a problem in the C Central is an issue of transformation it's an issue of resistance to transform and the internal issues of the allocation of work which kind of work is given to who so now the JS is aware that it needs to find a leader that is suitable address those prevailing problems in the game one also understands that the JSC will need to find a suitable leader yes but also needs needs to be seen to be pushing ahead with some of the reforms initiated under retired chief justice Raymond zondo um you know things like applying the written criteria to the JC adopted in 2023 and so forth how instrumental will that be considering the impact of the JC's Antics on the courts more so the the concourt well I I can imagine what's going to happen B the closed doors in those deliberations because the commiss now they want to sleep having discussed extensively because remember each candidate brought his or her own vision of the of the division having um familiarized themselves with the challenges that are confronting the division and to ensure that Western Cape division is not an island it's part of the Judiciary within the country it fits in very well into the bigger the broader vision of the judici of the Republic so surely those issues will have to be considered we shall have um the benefit of that candidate and having had his candidates that are being interviewed I think the last candidate was being interviewed now J T surely whoever presented whoever the CH come up with it means somebody who has presented a convincing vision for the division and is's a suitable candidate very well thank you so much for speaking to us this evening legal analyst now makang joining us via video link of course weighing in as the Judicial Service Commission searches for the next judge president of the Western Cape High Court

3Eg1MtuoLiA,Day 5 | Judicial Service Commission Interviews: 14 October 2024,2024-10-14T19:55:04Z,10656,often informal Poes are used in our court it was clear that there is a huge need for legal assistance by litigant who do not qualify for legal aid or Pro boner assistance to this end I intend toaz with all the stakeholders to set up a help help desk at the court building that would be manned by members of the profession in just charge of the pro boner obligations they could assist the unrepresented litigant with competing forms with explaining everyday legal jargon that we take for granted and which is completely far and intimidating to inperson litigants peroral forms could also be drafted which would make it easier for l l litigant to complete and to access the legal system for example you get first year practitioners who are not yet able to act as small claims Commissioners they could discharge their Pro boner obligations while sharpening the skills increase the exposure to the Practical side of a legal practice while at the same time providing support to the unrepresented litigant generally people don't come to court unless they have to or they are desperate being summonsed to court is a daunting and intimidating thing and we need to put these people at ease by putting them at ease and making them comfortable it goes to increasing access to the judicial system we also need to take into account that the nature of crime has changed it has become more structured more organized and is no longer localized therefore I believe ongoing communication and cooperations between different divisions through the office of the Chief Justice will become increasingly necessary these organized crimes are National they need to be addressed on a national level they are not provincial it would also facilitate creating uniformity and our Juris Prudence in dealing with these matters thereby preventing Forum Shopping it could also relies or result in the maximize of our shared resources and increased access to Justice each division has its own strengths and we can learn from one another I would also have regular meetings that are minuted which addresses substantive issues by holding regular meetings that focus on issues of substance it allows the division to transform as a whole to brainstorm and to formulate a collective response to common issues minutes will allow for institutional memory to be retained and for increased accountability it also provides a measure or provides a means of measuring outcomes this will ultimately result in buyin and ownership the judges of The Division I have a good relationship with all my fellow judges the support staff who assist us as well as other stakeholders such as the office of the family Advocate the office of the director of public prosecution and members of the profession my interpersonal skills will enhance my ability to fulfill my role as judge president I believe to Be an Effective and efficient judge president you need to continuously understand the interest and needs of those you lead the effort essential that you remain in the trenches so to speak if afforded the privilege to serve as judge president I will continue to discharge the obligations generally expected of a judge when you ha the same Hawk it is easier to understand the developments in the profession and needs and challenges faced by the judicial offices and support staff under your care and address these effectively I will use case allocation positively to empower and for the transfer of skills without sacrificing the quality of Justice to this this will ensure that each judicial officer is continuously provided with opportunity to grow his or her skill set this body has repeatedly heard that when senior judges retire it leaves a gap of skill of expertise if all the judges are empowered and upskilled there wouldn't be that Gap there shouldn't be a gap when members of the Judiciary retire because those that come afterwards that are appointed more recently should have been sufficiently upskilled and empowered not only to be elevated to higher courts but to lead the division Juris prudentially where they serve case allocation should also not continue skewed briefing patterns this body has heard that there's a problem with skewed briefing patterns but it's more problematic when case allocations perpetuate skewed briefing patterns when matters are allocated on perceived expertise of Judges based on the practice or the expertise that they had before that is a means of disempowering and disheartening judges we need to upskill we need to empower we need to realize that every judge given the opportunity can take it's heres or herole in managing the Judiciary in contributing to the Judiciary I would also identify management tasks that can be rotated amongst the judges in the division to allow for those who have an opp for those who have an appetite and a willingness to participate in the leadership of the division case allocation should also be done to prevent Forum Shopping which is prevalent in the Western Cape and it should also have as one of its objectives the finalizations of matters and parted and the prevention of parted matters it must be done in an equitable fair and balanced Manner and must as far as possible be done in an transparent and open manner based on the latest update there were 21 judgments that were outstanding for longer than 6 months and 41 that were outstanding for longer than 3 months in addressing this I'd firstly ascertain whether the information captured is correct and then engage with the individual judge to ascertain what if anything can be done to address the delay some of the outstanding judgments are by acting judges the failure to get judgments are time is Le problematic if acting judges are struggling and not or not prioritizing getting out of judgments I would not cons I would consider whether or not he or she should be invited back for a further term this would bring me to how I would appoint acting judges judicial Recruitment and selection process must maximize the diversity of each bench not only in respect of race gender and ethnicity but also in respect of um professional background abilities and exper experience I would look for judicial candidates who have the following characteristics judicial temperament intelligence ethics and in this regard I would also liaz with the oversight bodies such as the Bar Council the LPC Chief magistrates to ensure that the person who is invited to act is a person in good standing that there are no complaints against the person that the person has no disciplinary action pending or findings against him or her i' also Le with a chief magistrate in respective magistrates coming to act to ensure that they don't have parted matters that need the attention um and if needs be to arrange make the arrangements that magistrates continue to get the opportunity to act without sacrificing the duties in the lower courts and then I'd also look for legal courage and integrity because sometimes we are required to make difficult decisions and being a judge is not a popular it's not a often you are not well-liked because you make unpopular decisions you are forced to make hard decisions so you need legal courage I will also look for experience and education and the ability to communicate I will look at the person's health and age I would establish a practice whereby permanent judges could provide me with a list of potential candidates eligible for acting I would establish whether they Sorry by by getting the input of other judges in identifying candidates there would be Advanced transparency in identifying candidates to come and act I believe that the reintroduction of the continuous Ro would ensure that cases are finalized sooner and would also prevent the increase in part matters it would also be to the advantage of the legal aid and director of public Prosecutors Office who themselves have limited personnel and are unable to deal with multiple cases running simultaneously the increase in parted matters are counter to the right of a speedy trial in the Western Cape Fridays were previously kept for appeals and if you are not allocated an appeal you expected to use the Friday either to prepare for the heing scheduled for the Monday or to work on your outstanding judgments however more recently applications and matters have been allocated to judges on a Friday I intend to do away with this if appointed or recommended by this body preparation and judgment writing is a core part of our core function and should not be neglected to ignore this core component could compromise the quality of Justice being dispensed judges are human and are not machines and therefore we need to ensure that our judges do not burn out and that their well-being is also considered as judge president I will encourage cohesion by affing each judge to sit with one another and not to allocate matters to the same judges or the same panel of Judges sitting together by rotating bench allocations and providing opportunities for judges to speak together and work together with one another it will result in Greater understanding of one another I will also identify specific judges who could assist with court-based mediation in matters that could be mediated however I do need to stress that when court-based mediation takes place especially in Family Matters we should not ignore the office of the family Advocate because the rule that provides for mediation is silent on the child's voice so we need to make sure that if we do court-based mediation the child's voice is heard in that process chief justice that is in essential my vision and Broad plans for the division and I will address anything further based on questions from the Commissioners I understand it's been a long day for the Commissioners and the Chief Justice no that's that's comprehensive U enough I I take it that all these great things you propose are not happening as we speak no not to my knowledge it's not as I said there's a lack of transparency at the moment okay uh just to round off on your CV there there are many other things you do including uh training uh of young practitioners and you do that uh for the kba and and the bla and you also serve as the as a member of the wine small claims Advisory board that cor chief justice that's important work all right you you 51 so you still have about 19 years to look forward to on this bench I've got the time and I'm prepar to all the time in the world okay judge Campell thank you CJ I have no questions for the thank you Mr B thank you CJ and uh judge Slingers good evening good evening um I just have one question or it's a two-part question so the GCB and various commenters um made mention of perhaps you're not ready and CJ touched on that and and I noted your reply um and I suppose the nub of it is that well how how can you gain the experience if you're not offered an acting opportunity Etc and I think that's a perfectly Fair answer under normal circumstances is my caveat so my question is given what we all know and we've been hearing this whole day is the division really at this point in a state of health to have the luxury of focusing on rotations in critical leadership positions when what is actually now very obviously required is stability and continuity and an unfragmented of leadership even during in an acting capacity and if that is if the answer is well yes perhaps not at the moment then is your response perhaps not then revealing of a lack of awareness of the mure in which you find yourself in in that Division and um perhaps missing the forest for the trees and and and let me just finish by saying it's genuinely just a question I'm not I'm not saying that is the case thank you thank you commissioner let me answer it this way I think you are correct the division is at a stage where need strong leadership if appointed as judge president I'm not going to circulate my responsibilities I will be that leader I will be the final accountability the buck stops by me as head of that court I take responsibility but at the same time I need to empower and upskill the judges in my division so I need to provide them with opportunities to do that I need to provide them with the means to transfer skills I need to provide them with the means of testing their appetite for taking on more responsibilities in the court I need to provide them with a means of seeing how things are run I think by rotating management tasks leadership management tasks not the leadership of the division but tasks it will result in Greater transparency greater trust in my leadership and greater Buy in I hope I've answered your question yeah thank you very much thank you CJ commissioner baloy thank you CJ good evening judge um good evening I'm here yes um judge your and it's really more a followup uh on your discussion with Mr bof your your response to the to the GCB um and especially your references to the other candidates in in the way that you deal with it you say if if the comments of the GCB are valid then that also disqualifies the many other candidates because they don't have they don't have experience now on the face of it I think it's a fair it's a fair comment but you do appreciate surely that in this position um the the JSC has reason to be concerned about absence of evidence of experience in leadership I've looked at your CV um there's nothing in your CV at least that I can see that speaks to your leadership experience uh and then of course your answers to to the gcb's comments they they they speak less to your experience in leadership position but rather focus more on well it applies to the other candidates as well is is it is it not fair actually to be concerned about absence of evidence of leadership thank you commissioner um perhaps my CV is a bit short on setting out my leadership role as deputy director I led multi-disciplinary teams of different professionals I was responsible for budgetary plans for management for um allocating tasks so I do consider that a leadership role and yes I've not had a leadership role in judiciary and this body is correct to be concerned and I don't mean to be flippant by what I'm going to say next so I don't mean it with any disrespect or in please take it in the sense in which it's meant when I was reflecting on this issue I realized that my as a mother helped prepared me for this because as a mother I've had to do Conflict Management I've had to be transparent I've had to be accountable I've had to upskill so there are lots of similarities between raising children or being a parent and judge president of a court where the court is the home and the judges act like children um I don't mean to be flippant when I say that thank thank you judge um I'm sure your colleagues at the the division will have a further discussion with you about that last part chief justice president M thank you very much good afternoon judge slers good afternoon judge president um I listened with interest to the vision that you shared with the with the commission and in response to one of the questions uh by one of the commissioners you you stated that um and I'm paraphrasing you're not afraid to take the bull by the horns and so um you have alluded to a few weaknesses that you would correct if appointed for example uh the allocation of other matters other than appeals on Fridays um and and you your complaint as I as I gathered from your response was burn out because judges now no longer have an opportunity to use that Friday to prepare for cases on Mondays or to write judgments now my question is as a person who's not afraid to grab the bull by the horns and who has been in that division for quite some time um first of all maybe let me ask this question do you serve in any of the judges committees I serve on the Civil practice directive committee that hasn't sat in a while I also assist well I don't know if it's the human resources committee but I have been brought in to assist with the appointment of secretaries yes and you say this the first one that you mention uh the Civil matters committee has not said for a while are there any steps that you as a member of the committee took to at least con um you know discuss with the chairperson of the committee in with a view to convening meetings of that committee no I have not the practice directives that was last done was implemented um I think there was going to be a need to sit again after the case lines was rolled out and at that stage I'd have taken step so that we could do appro I would request a meeting so that appropriate directives could be put in place to facilitate that now um as a judge any judge uh in any division always has the right to play agenda items uh for discussion at the judges meeting now have you ever included these concerns that you have raised here have you ever at any stage uh included them as agenda matters uh for discussion in a judges meeting and have you raised them at the level of Judges meeting thank you um some of these issues were raised on agendas for the judges meetings unfortunately the judges meetings never kept to the agenda and no issue of substance was really discussed um it wasn't judges meetings were taking place once a term if that and even though matters were placed on agenda such as the continuous role was indeed placed on the agenda at the judge's meeting it simply wasn't gotten to and the meeting wasn't reconvened to address it yes specifically with with regards to this um concern that you raised regarding allocation of other matters non let me call them non appeal matters on Fridays Have You Ever Raised it at a judge's meeting and I'm talking specifically about you it wasn't necessary for me today it because it was placed on the agenda the need for the issues as I've noted to this committee was placed on the judges meetings agenda just wasn't addressed it it just wasn't it wasn't addressed it was placed on the agenda for jud's meeting not nearly by myself but the issues that I've highlighted was brought to the ention of a judge's meeting by placing it on the agenda thank you thank you judge thank you thank you president judge presid thank you very much uh chief justice good evening judge lers good evening um commissioner um I think let me first say I listened closely to your vision and I'm impressed Frankly Speaking you've never been in any leadership position in the division but your vision is on point on what I've heard here for the whole day so I want to congratulate you for that clearly you've applied your mind to it one thing that uh I didn't hear you speak on maybe I missed it is how do you how would you if you were appointed resolve these skewed uh capacitation of criminal roles of civil roles thank you first of all I think one of the issues one of the steps I would take is identify acting judges who can do criminal matters because at the moment they are the majority of Judges or acting judges who are appointed are not able or have no criminal law experience therefore the burden or not the burden the responsibility of doing criminal matters falls to the permanent judges which removes them from the Civil pool um completely so there's also a perception that only certain people can do criminal matters and that civil matters are deserved for others so I would appoint more acting judges who are able to take some of the burden off the permanent judges and I would ensure that judges who have parted criminal matters finalize that first before before they get any other responsibility including other criminal matters um just a comment before I go to my next question you were a director in a law firm that's a leadership position isn't it it is it is thank you JP I think you should have mentioned it because you should changing yourself but in terms of your judgment writing style I was impressed you you mention here the British tobacco case that was had during Co that that's correct that's the one that differed from the howting full court judgment am I correct you are correct and yours is the applicable law because the sca upheld yours and the the appeal on the cting one was settled am I correct that is correct right the only judgment that I could note of ser note is the irankunda Judgment that deals with a very obscure area in Refugee law the treatment of surplus claims the sea reversed you there they did I understand though um commissioner that the matter is going to go to the Constitutional court so I would be hesitant to go into the merits of the matter at this particular Forum but I think the point I want to make is the sca didn't make any critical comments about how you went about in that matter am I correct that's correct judge um commissioner thank you thank you very much CJ thank you JP commissioner MK thank you CJ good evening judge SL good evening commissioner just one question from my side uh uh which uh uh I need to to be up front it puzzles me that uh we have uh five judges from the same division contesting I mean getting interviewed for one position in your judges meeting uh the issue of succession planning uh for the division is it not uh sometime discussed just in terms of of ensuring that uh you take the division forward I'll tell you why in other divisions where we have had interviews of similar nature you'll find one or two candidate which clearly relates uh the message that indeed the judges of that particular division are able to sit down and make a reflection and come to a common uh agreement in terms of how do they take the institution forward thank you commissioner I don't want to speak poorly of other candidates who have appeared before this commission but I think I'm not being unfair when I say that nothing of substance really was discussed at the judges meetings and there was no feedback provided and the issue of succession plans was definitely not raised or discussed at the judge's meetings when they were held thank thank you CJ commissioner you pass it's okay I think I'll I was going to ask a question about uniting the the division shall I shall I take a stab at it okay thank you uh judge um I'm over here uh I just wanted to ask a very quick one um and it's something just to to understand because we've asked a number of different candidates uh given some of the challenges and you alluded to them um about the different camps and some of the different uh opportunities given and I think it's also important to note that it's also become clear that there was only one person who was allowed to act in the position of djp so I don't think we should hold it against you that you haven't had that opportunity uh but regardless um I'm interested interested in how you would build a bridge to ensure Unity um across that division line but also to ensure maximum cooperation because one thing that's come through very strongly today is that some people cooperate and some people don't thank you I think we should start out by acknowledging that a division is a social organization we've got 33 permanent judges maybe not the full compliment at the moment but we've got people with strong personalities and ego so there are going to be disagreements my role as judge president would not be to get them to like one another necessarily we are entitled not to like everybody but what my Jud my job as judge president would be would get them to respect one another and to work together um at the moment if you look at the latest um report on the productivity the Western cap is working we're getting our judgments out to my knowledge at this stage no judge has refused to sit with another judge we are being productive we may not needly always like one another but we are sitting together and we are building respect so as I said The more engagement one gives the more we get to learn to speak the more we get to learn to work with one another we will start finding one another then once there's respect it will soon it can go over to liking and when I was newly appointed there was a thing called Friday lunches the invitation was extended those who wanted to attend could those who didn't want to attend didn't have to and some judges would attend sometimes others would not um also year in functions we haven't had that in years but I don't think we should force the judges to be best friends they're never going to be best friends part of their role as a judge is to bring an independent mind to be which means on occasion you disagree and sometimes those disagreements can be quite robust but what I will do is Foster respect uh thank you for making yourself available for this position and for your patience with us you're excused thank you um chief justice thank you Commissioners thank you just one on e e spe good uh evening J T good evening CJ I don't know where to begin to apologize to you we've we've done a huge disservice but as I I recall uh an interview you you were put through late in the evening not so long ago so you are used to I I'm becoming famous for being the nocturnal one you a well otherwise I I am okay under the circumstances CJ thank you good good all right uh you have an interesting life story to tell you you hold three law degrees uh all obtained from unissa whilst you working that is correct CJ B LLB and and LL um you started out as a general laborer at Sab that is correct and then found your way to the Department of Justice where you worked as a court interpreter and went through the usual runs Court interpreter public prosecutor that is correct but then you did not become a magistrate right there and then you you went to do your articles that is cor correct CJ but then did not practice as an attorney yes soon after I started I was invited to the bench CJ so that was in 1999 that is correct so you were a magistrate between 1999 and 2016 that is correct no no no and 2021 sorry until the end of 2021 yes that that's when I I ceased being a magistrate and became a judge and you in that period you direct your way all the way to Chief magistrate that is correct s being head of court of a few courts yes okay so you you know stranger to to Administration and and and and managing people yes leadership and management leadership and management indeed uh so you you just tell me about your acting stance until your your permanent appointment in 2022 when and where did you act I I started in hting h the the first judge president to to invite me was Judge president Lambo H and I acted in both ptor in Johannesburg and uh that was 2014 and 2016 in fact at the time that I P my BS to start as a chief magistrate for the Western Cape I I was acting in the in the hen Division and then um after my arrival in the Western Cape in June 2016 in the last term of 2017 judge president lpp invited me to to act in in the high court and and I started acting there um there were times a term or two when I would go back to the magistracy especially during covid just to provide the necessary guidance to my colleagues and then um I I was appointed as a judge from January 2022 all right you you've written a number of of judgments that is correct in your time is as as a judge um one or two which uh are said to be questionable for un reasonable or sorry for one reason or the other yes um how many judgments uh would you venture if you've written around 150 how many reported if you know as of now it's over 30 and over 10 only in five matters that are taken on appe yes All right so what what do you say to the JP's um uh comment that your your findings are in in in in in one case um cast doubt on your understanding of constitutional law and administrative law particularly in relation to the jurisdictions and powers of the courts and uh that you occasionally stray outside the bounds of judicial power in a way that has the potential to affect public P perceptions of your Independence yeah I I have commented on on the Judgment because uh and and the primary reason was just to indicate facts which I thought it is necessary for the commission to know which were not clearly obvious from the judgment and or that's the matter of executive mayor of the City of Cape Town that that is correct that is correct CJ and I think it it is important to to note that I had no such matter with those parties before me as a result of which I wrote a judgment there's no judgment those parties in that case developed on appeal and and I'm mentioning the the this um against the background of acknowledging the the concerns that have been have been raised and I accept that I'm a human being infallible I'm not here to say I'm perfect I'm just saying I'm ready to make a contribution to the challenges that are being faced by the Western Cape division of the high court you you've done you're an activist you you you you've done and you continue to do many things in the legal sphere and outside the legal sphere including being a bishop of a church that that is correct CJ you are described by some of the professional bodies as an accomplished leader and hard worker with the requisite attributes skills aptitude and temperament to assume the responsibilities of this position for which you've applied that that is correct I think your your leadership qualities uh I'm not in doubt well not as far as I can discern from the reviews that have been submitted to this body thank you what one gathers from your CV but then and I ask this uh with uh the full reassurance that I have because I personally know of the contribution you've made your your belief in the empowerment of women empowerment of women in the Judiciary and your contribution for example to the South African chapter of the International Association of women judges from a way back when it was not fashionable for male uh judicial officers to be members or to take any interest in that body but you were right there in the trenches with us fighting the causes uh of of of gender equality in the Judiciary so I ask I put this concern raised by the lssa comfortable with that knowledge they say um they don't oppose your appointment as judge president of that division but uh caution us to consider that uh you are competing against several highly qualified female candidates who would help increase the number of female judges president I I know it's unfair to put this to you but I have to what would you say to this comment I I acknowledge that um the point at which we are in the country it it is important um to asset the neglected role previously um or of women in the Judiciary in general but in particular in in leadership um but but I I have also consciously decided you you've rightly commented that I a member amongst others of the SEC I awj and and obviously the the advancement of of of women especially in leadership positions is something that is close to my heart as a member and as one of the objectives of of the organization but I also reflected on the challenges that are there in the division and against the background of my what I would call for lack of better terminology functional literacy of the environment of judicial leadership and what I have observed happening in the division H I thought it is also my call to Avail myself at the end of the day it is up to the judicial Services Commission to make uh the call all right what ideas do you have for that division of yours um CJ I as concisely as you possibly can make it I I will try I I have already provided in writing together with my submission of nomination documents my my vision so I I will only touch on on on a few areas in in respect of what what I deem to um need some um highlighting uh first of all I I want to um present myself to to the commission as to who is Daniel tar um you you have a record of my academic training and and my my uh path of travel to this point but also and and things that I think are very necessary for the division is what I call my indigenous Heritage the the wisdom of my ancestors that I'm bringing to the division in the far northwest corner of the Republic there is a clan or a tribe called Baba they are in the area called malibo ordinarily referred to as the blowback area that is where my maternal site comes from and I'm sharing this with the commission because I'm the grandson of one of the leaders there at his time known as Nal home now one of one of the things that he has taught me around leadership which I'm carrying if I'm appointed with me to the Western Cape is to say say son where there is a point of difference always humble yourself to the possibility that you may be the one that is wrong and where the logic of the other seems to be superior to yours and or you're shown to be wrong learn from that and then towards the northeastern corner of the Republic there is a family that leads the bedi nation chief justice I'm privileged to carry their serame now one of the things that I have learned from the lineage of my ancestors from that area is that when there are challenges there is a need for courage and resilience H one one of the most known leaders coming from that Sur name would be suuk Kuni those who know South African history would know about him and and lastly talking about the indigenous wisdom that I'm bringing to the division and carrying with me is that but when I followed up on my genealogy it took me to a nation H currently occupying the central part of bwana and um it is a nation called bangu now they have a saying let it rain for everybody you you you can't want to dominate and want to be reigned on only yourself so this is against the background of um the trail of the portfolio of evidence around leadership that you have in the academic training part of the parcel that I'm bringing to the division and and I'm mentioning this background as as an introduction chief justice because my own view is that judgeship is a calling when you have occasion to lead judicial officers in general you are an equal among equals first and then your position makes you the amongst equals and you represent the judicial authority of the Republic of South Africa in the division for which you are called as a judge press president now one of the areas of concern CJ in the division is collegiality and this collegiality is not necessary only uh between judges serving in the division amongst themselves the disturbance of collegiality in the Western Cape goes beyond the city judges it involves and it includes um other other stakeholders in in my view H trust is lost amongst other colleagues and between colleagues and and other role players now to deal with that amongst others there is a need to address two issues in particular number one is etiquette number two um is communication I'm I'm mentioning etiquette as distinct from from communication because CJ when I arrived in both Hing and the Western Cape itself on the first day of term both judge presidents Mambo and judge president tro the time took me to the T room of the division and they introduced me to colleagues in the division so the first day of term it was compulsory for lack of better terminology for all judges to be available uh for the judge's common room you did not during time bump into somebody in the garage which even alerts you to issues of your own Security in the evening when you leave the building and when you ask who are you you are told no I'm I'm an judge in the division and and unfortunately this is one what is what what one is experiencing so so questions of of etiquette introducing your colleagues on the first day how you communicate with judges I mean I was told in both divisions by both judge president Lambo and judge president clpp to say you do not and that is etiquette 101 you do not communicate with your colleagues through the administration you don't if there's anything that you want to communicate to your colleague you ask for the availability from them if you are the junior judge you are the one that has to walk to their Chambers it is unfortunate CJ that and and and these things are not things that I'm raising for the first time at this interview they are things that I've discussed with the leadership in the division I've expressed my my concern H for instance when you when you communicate if if I write to you CJ in Your Capacity as the Chief Justice of the Republic I expect you to respond to me in that capacity it is unfortunate if I have to receive correspondence from an email from somebody within the administration pretending to be you I I I I think it it is an upfront to the judicial Authority and and and the line function within the arm of the state of of the Judiciary so when we complain for L of better terms around the question of communication and consultation is not only simple complaints because they they affect as I say questions of etiquette and the location of the judicial Authority in the discussion because I must know whether in fact I'm discussing with a member of another chapter in the Constitution whether I'm talking to a chapter 10 or I'm still Within chapter 8 talking to the Judiciary or the judici head of the division so so it's not simple things in in my view and where one observes that the judicial Authority becomes subordinate amongst others in the manner in which communication is unfolding it is alerting and for a person with my background it becomes very difficult to to to to sustain that and and that is why amongst others because of acknowledgement of those kinds of concerns uh in order to help asset the judicial authority of the Republic in the division I'm saying I'm available moving uh to the other aspect um an impartial courageous and an independent division let me hessen to say judges in the division individually do their best they work very hard and and I don't want us to take anything away from them what needs attention in the is the environment under which judges are waking that that really needs attention um so so that um the the intellectual rigor in terms of the Juris prudence the environment is created for that I mean when when you deal with a complex matter um to to produce a judgment you need time there there must be engagement uh once you allocated a complex matter with with the judicial leader and there must be an understanding of you know what time do you need in relation to further allocations so so as to Camp the question of judgments outstanding for long especially on complex matters and then uh CJ the other aspect that I would like to touch on is the the question of backlogs I think there is a need for individualization in in the Western Cape we have what we call various divisions so you have division one up until division 16 and they all basically talk to line functions you know whether you're dealing with Civil Appeals it has got its own division number or numbers when you deal with Criminal Appeals it has got its own division numbers so it is very important to look at that breakdown to have a template where you look at which judges have been allocated to which matters and which judges have been doing a particular L function for a longer period than others what is the overall impact of their input in relation to the output of the division um and this is how I intend addressing the question of backlogs whether in civil or family I have raised a concern in a public meeting of Judges around the question of allocation including my observation and and I'll use the terminology that I used in the meeting chief justice because sometimes you have to use language to put that thing in for people to understand the nature of the concern and the extent to which you view it it's seriousness and I've raised the concern that the manner in which we are operating in my view leads to what one may call privatization of private law in the division if you have a pattern of allocations where consistently civil matters are given to acting judges and primarily who come from the bar and judges who are serving in the division are not dealing with civil matters complex civil matters you are heading to a situation where permanent judges become Experts of criminal litigation you are not building capacity I have observed uh previous interviews and one I've what I've picked up is that the commission does attend to consense around briefing patterns for practitioners but I'm saying uh from from this interview I think Commissioners would have picked up that there is also a need to look at the allocation of matters otherwise we are heading to a situation where chief justice you do not have Africans for argument sake in particular an African female who leads a panel on a matter involving a dispute that arose in the National Assembly you're not going to have that panel unless there is a disruption of leadership that's my observation you you you you you are never going to have a black in the generic sense female leading a panel on the questions of constitutional law or even complex civil matters and and against the background of our history these are things we need to attend to we we need not pretend that H all is well I think it is very clear that all is not well including on questions of allocation so it is important to keep a template to say who has done what when and where you observe an over concentration of certain judges in certain areas to the exclusion of certain judges in certain areas it is the purpose and the objective of leadership to interfere to make sure that the allocation does not create an impression that certain minds are intellectually inferior to engage with h certain matters that come before our courts in the division I'm I'm saying this CJ against the background of H what was a public comment by the previous CJ of a concern of lack of depth for lack of better terminology within current saving judges in terms of Readiness for the conal court so if it doesn't start at at the high court level where there is exposure H to complex civil matters including conal and administrative law questions if there is no exposure how do we expect the experience to be built up and and I think against that background I'm saying to Lish yes tar I available to assist the division uh perhaps in in closing CJ um I am not just saying things that I haven't been doing um including the training and preparation of aspirant magistrates and aspirant judges for the high court um I am in discussions with uh the various organizations that are active within the legal fraternity um I Avail myself whether it's SE iwj whether it's Nadel whether it's bla whether it's advocates for transformation whether it's sa when I'm invited for training on subject matter issues I do Avail myself as part of the strategy to capacity building but I also do so in terms of acting judges who appointed for for the division and not only for the division I mean I I receive calls even outside the division from judges bouncing ideas with me um on on on certain areas of the law that we are discussing so um the the contined training and capacity building is one area that I will continue h to to to deal with um and digitization CJ um one of the immediate things that we can do there there are currently audio visual remand facilities that the department provides uh let me say the Department of Justice which which ordinarily supports the the magistracy but there's collaboration in terms of infrastructure I think it is still the Department of Justice that takes responsibility for infrastructure for the high courts from my engagements with with the administration so those are things that we can do immediately I mean there's no reason in my view why every morning there should be always police running on the sidelines of the heavy traffic in the Western Cape concerned about their security and safety but also rushing um awaiting trial prisoners to be at court before before 9:00 when we actually have audio visual remand facilities as an Avenue to explore over and above the question of of digitization so I I I don't want to go further than that CJ in the light of of time I will deal with any areas that may be raised H in in but but perhaps most importantly on on the question of of Courage I I have to State and and I think it's it's a matter of public record that I am of the view and still remain so as J even after reading the latest report by jpe on the institutional model for the Judiciary I have read it I haven't seen its discussion on Section 166 of the Constitution which deals with the judicial system and I still hold the view that whilst there's differentiation in the hierarchies of the courts um the high courts the magistrates courts and the traditional courts the fact of the matter is that what the Constitution refers to as the judicial system includes the Judiciary or otherwise the Judiciary includes the judicial system so so you are the Chief Justice in my view not only of the Superior Courts you the Chief Justice of the judicial system which includes the magistrates courts which includes the traditional courts Commissioners would would would have had the benefit of reading one of the latest papers that I wrote where I'm saying South Africa is a reluctant and doubtful leader of Nations when it comes to the inclusion of indigenous people's laws and courts in a Judicial System of a country and and I I I still stand by that position CJ to say you are the Chief Justice not only of the Superior Courts but of the magistrates courts including the traditional courts because they are courts through another Act of Parliament and as a result as we move forward and here I'm talking long term CJ I'm basically saying I'm an asset in your hands if appointed because because I have the functional literacy of what happens in the traditional courts I've been involved in their training as I indicated I by the incidence of my birth I was born within that environment so I know what is happening uh judge president Mambo is on record as saying we must move towards mediation and I'm closing here and I'm saying there is no informed institutional memory in the Republic on mediation conciliation and arbitration better than the traditional courts we need to tap into that resource thank you CJ thank you judge judge gamble thank you C I have nothing for the for the candidate Mr BOS thank you CJ uh evening even um the matter of the executive mayor yes um I've had a look at your response um and I just have two brief comments to which I would appreciate your response yes so in your response you say at one point in respect of you know in your response to the objection or the criticism raised by some of the bodies is that you say I didn't have the heart to walk away from that child unattended by judicial intervention now these were sentencing proceedings and I certainly can empathize or sympathize and and even admire the the sentiment expressed there but is that not what makes your job actually so difficult and why this isn't a job just for any practitioner is the ability to to to not allow the emotional bleed into what your core duty is when it when dealing with a matter before you within the confines of the law and and did you not perhaps make yourself guilty of a misstep there by allowing that to happen in that regard um and maybe first respond to that and and then I can get to the second part chief justice I I held the view that when remember as a Point of Departure sentencing is an inquisitorial process over and above when you then have a child before you and I'm an upper guardian of minor children um within the division that's what I understand the law to be I also moved from the premise that what we call a visis victim impact statements H during sentencing proceedings my view was that that was not simply an academic ritual to be performed by a judge my view was that in in sentencing procceed ings um when you are faced with a child in distress you have a duty to intervene that's the view that I held I I accept as I said um referring to Nan Al my grandfather I have seen the Judgment of the full bench and I accept their Authority I've learned from that thank you judge and then just the second part I mean there various issues raised um by the full bench in dealing with your judgment um but I just want to touch on the issue of judicial overreach and where they say look you you fail to display difference to the Constitutional limits of judicial powers and then in your response you you make a statement which I find um curious in where you say the Western Cape division still must develop Juris Prudence of how the municipality deals with a vulnerable child in distress as a victim of crime now does that not once again reveal a misunderstanding of your limits of power in that what you described there to me strikes me as the domain of the law makers and the policy makers the executive and the and the legislature not the Judiciary and and and that in essence fundamentally strikes at the heart of the concept of of um administrative power and Ultra vas and and and the limits of power in general yeah I I I have taken note of of the criticism as I say um when when you are in the heat of of the moment um there are matters that you consider and and that is why in in our legal system there is a a review and an appeal process you see and and I'm I'm not as I indicated I'm I'm not here to present myself as Mr nor all I accept that um now and then in the nature of our job um you may strive to do your best but your best may not simply be enough but but I don't think one should be judged by one matter when you deal with multitudes of matters every day so I I I I have learned there are what CJ I would call for leg of better terminology long shorts you know I I I follow soccer so when the national team plays there's there was a a guy called Gana he played for Sundowns you know even from a far he tried to kick for gold so so if you look at matters where I I have been criticized the few that I've have been criticized on is where I had taken the long shot uh in in the greater scheme of things and and I accept that H sometimes you may not score from a long shot thank you thank you judge thank you CJ commissioner Godel thank you CJ um good evening yeah good evening good evening uh judge tar um you've been a judge now for 2 years um and you wish to lead the Western Cape division yes and you were the chief magistrate for Cape Town from 2016 to 2022 how many magistrates courts resorted under you in that time because it's you're not just the magistrate for Cape Town it's it's for the wider area yes um when you are the Magistrate of of Cape Town the chief magistrate of Cape Town you're basically responsible for half of the province not the entirety of the province so it was over 80 magistrates courts that that reported to me all right now earlier this year in a review judgment you were quite critical of the magistrates in Cape Town you said in a review judgment that magistrates in Cape Town have become recruiting agents for gang culture on the cape Flats you base this on the fact that in your opinion they do this by incarcerating accused persons rather than granting bail although this was based on one specific case this is a very generalized comment now you are applying for a um leadership position but what does this say about your leadership of the Cape Town magistracy between 2016 and 2022 because this judgment was delivered early this year yeah but I I I think um it was it was not an an observation that simply came from um you know a a on of thing um the if if you read quite a few judgments where I I have raised issue and it's not that those issues were not discussed with the magistracy at the time that I was the lead um they they they were discussed um so so the the the question of how you deal within you you You' also recall that very early whilst I was still acting I I complained about what I call judicial warehousing of poor people and and and it spoke to to the same issue that when a person appears before you for the first time in our constitutional democracy as a Judicial officer you have to make an effort to are certain that the person before you is actually a candidate for incarceration pre-trial so it's not a once of thing there there's there are quite a number of judgments where and some of them were written even when I was acting and remember when you're acting you only act during term during research you go back to your station so so it was not a a a once of thing it's it's it's it's a concern that I have consistently raised the incarceration especially in the Western Cape the incarceration of poor persons in circumstances where if proper assessment of the fact was done the the return would have been different in my view but this was one specific review judgment and if I understand correctly review reviews come to judges they allocate it randomly and you read through it and you decide whether the magistrate made the correct decision or not yes so this was a review judgment in which you generalized and you used words like bad attitude laziness and der reliction of Duty so my final question to you is is this the collegiality that you referred to earlier I I don't I don't understand collegiality to include not calling out things that you believe are not right collegiality includes that when you believe that things are not correct you voice it out to the relevant persons and and that that was my Approach sorry CJ but surely you can't use one review judgment to use these words to describe all the Capetown magistrates I I I I have indicated CJ that the question of how bail is handled and pre-trial decisions on eration of persons is a concern in the western king that's the premise from which I move commission thank you CJ good evening judge tar good evening commissioner yes two promp question I'm impressed by what you term indigenous wisdom now I take it you are from limo if I understood you my Origins are from there yes yes yes and um there there has been kingship dispute particularly within even tari kingdom yes put it that way again in the position in which we are applied we know I take it you know that there's been some challenges around leadership all what I want to find from you um can you share with us what did you do uh to prove your leadership skill uh in those the uh difficult senior position traditional leadership on the other hand and uh the the leadership of the Judiciary in the in the Western Cape division what have you done to demonstrate that you will be a fit and proper person to lead that division it is in that context that I'm I'm asking you this question yeah let let me deal with the with the leadership dispute within the the tari family first H you you'd appreciate that because of the offices that I have held it was necessary for me to stay away uh from from those disputes because it it would be unfair for me H to align with one uh particular uh extended family to the exclusion of the other when matters are before courts and I'm active within the court environment so so I'm not in that space that that's the first one the the the second one is as I've indicated the concerns that um I am raising here are not concerns that are not unknown to the leadership as I say I mean judge gamble is sitting here he doesn't here for the first time that I am complaining that there is privatization of private law in the Western Cape so so it's it's not the question that these things have not been raised um I I think the question is how they responded to thank you you finished yes thank you chief chief thank you chief justice thank you commissioner commissioner thank you CJ I'm not sure what I'm right when I'm say when I say good evening good good evening I I I carry the same name of that but I don't carry that title okay yeah look I'm just I just want you to just to address this question I want you to just to address this question if you want to be safe you must just say m yeah I want you to address this question that commissioner MMA often ask in circumstance such as this I think you are in that division you have been appointed is two years yes like I I don't doubt your leadership background and all as you have said but would it not if at this stage I mean just if you comment on that if you are appointed now is it not too soon or as commissioner simply put that we are baptized today and look for the seat of the bishop IMM we B when coming from the water say hey where are the Bishop State I me can't you deal with that just yeah I I I would indicate to say look as I indicated leading the Judiciary um it's it's quite different from ordinary leadership because um you you leading people who have distinguished themselves in in various ways all right and and that is why I'm saying at the end of the day uh over and above the need to say this is the way to go you humble yourself H to acknowledge that other judges may know certain things better than you do and what you then do under those circumstances is you use the strengths of your judicial officers to attend to problem areas as you identify them all that you need to do in the m is to provide a platform um colleagues must be must be free to approach you to say uh this is the way I think we should do things and and it is your responsibility then to assess the manner in which things are currently being done in the light of the new recommendations that comes through and then weigh your options to say which one is the best and sometimes you bounce ideas with other people including other judge presidents I mean I'm not going to go there and be you know the misore it all there are resources I mean Justice Mambo is an example you know judge presidents of other divisions are available the CJ herself is is available so and and as I say the the challenges some of the challenges that goes to the heart of what is the problem in the division in my view I have the experience of dealing with them I mean I've touched on the question of etiquette I've chared on the question of ass setting the judicial Authority in in the division so that it is known that this is the seat of the Judiciary of the province then my last question is can I make a follow you are appointed can I make a followup a follow commission yes no no I'm just as following up on what he's saying that in your two years and even when we are happy with your leadership qualities and all of that you don't see any leader you you see yourself that you arrive and say these ones I'm going to be in charge of them just on arrival because a a good leader is a leader who's able to identify leadership in others and be prepared to be led that's where the context of barudi comes from that you get baptized today and then immediately you say where are the pastors sitting you can't do that and then where where are you putting us I mean we all like you here we interviewed you we we're so happy with your leadership and all of that and then the next thing you come back to us in a division like that where there are senior judges and then we must over where African women in this interview came some of them demonstrated leadership which you should have seen even before you come here as a leader and say but there are African women here there are black women here with capacity there are other judges senior judges with capacity why can't you just allow that look let me be led by others to avoid putting the J the JC at a difficult position because you know even if we like you you put us in a position where we now have to go and speak against you think up think for us before just think for us please thank you you want to respond to that yeah I I I just have to say CJ than e e e e e e e e e e e e yeah good we all be s before the bench arrives may we all be seated thank you for for macrohon acid has larger particles and these sit on the surface of the skin they respond to them so so I was still at that pH I I haven't elevated that them elsewhere them elsewhere because I believe that most of the challenges in the division can actually be resolved there there are others that uh you you can't resolve I mean uh the the question of for instance um sharing tea during tea time some some colleagues naturally are not you know inclined to be in those spaces as As a matter of course so you not going to have each and every judge joining you in a tea club or in a t room um every day of the week that is available in the division you are not going to achieve that you at best you're going to achieve the majority of the judges being there yes follow up does it mean that if you say you were still at a point where you were waiting for responses in relation to the concerns that you raised does this mean that these concerns were only recently raised um I I I if if my recollection serves me well it's either in the last term or the ter before in the beginning of the last time or the time before but it was in this year thank you judge T thank you CJ thank you president commissioner Manan chief justice the the president has covered me on on this aspect of escalation of disputes I will I will then remain with one question good evening judge good evening yes um earlier on um there was a question posed to you in relation to your 2 and a half years experience I mean 2 and a half years of your Ascension to the Western Cape Division and I would want to believe that uh you you joined just as at the time that the then JP Sher was about to to go so a greater bul of your time was spent with uh the leadership of acting judge president goath as a permanent judge yes but if we include the acting period no yes because I I acted I started acting in the division in 2017 yes earlier in the day um there was um an indication made that um the problems in the divisions are largely due to the Fallout between the two heads of caught and um wouldn't you say that the fact that you came during the time when JP chop was gone or was about to go put you in a good state to address the problems that you have identified because you you were not deeply deeply affected by The Fallout between the two heads of Courts yes because in in the let me say when for leg of better terminology the PO hit the fan in or around February 2020 I was back in the magistracy at the time so I I know the division from 2017 up until February 2020 and subsequent to that I came came to a different division let let me give a classic example of of the T environment when I came into the division in 2017 up until 2020 all judges and and as I've said with a qualification that you can't get all the judges participating in in a common room te Club but the majority of Judges were members of that of the T club that that's when I left back just preco lockdown and and went back to to lead the magistrates during the lockdown when I came back uh almost only half attended te not not the the the better component of the division and and what happened is when the then judge president left there was for all intent and purposes a swap those who did not attend T between February 2020 up until the date of his departure then attended to te and those who attended during his ter in the majority did not attend that that was the reality and and it's still the prevailing position by the way as we speak so so there was never an occasion where there was no tea at all h it's just that there was a a change a one component attended during the term of Judge president I mean for instance the the refurbishment of the t- room know I I hear I hear you judge um I'm sorry to interject but but but I want you to tell this commission if it is at all possible yeah that um you you are not affected by the division you're not part of either faction because you can be regarded as an outsider who's bringing in um um who advantageous in the sense that you are not on either side yes I'm I'm alof I have the support and I enjoy the collegiality of both groups to put it mildly thank you chief justice commissioner thank you very much CJ good evening judge tar good evening on the the 11th of September 2024 you took a short outside the 18 area and it landed into a goal the matter that dealt with duty of support by the step parent yes to towards the stepchild uh you still remember that matter yes I do yes um in that matter you you came up with something that really excited a lot of people in the in the family space uh because it stretched somewhat the concept of Duty of support and it said there might be circumstances wherein when somebody has assumed that Duty by conduct uh that person can actually be ordered to to pay maintenance even though it's not a biological father or even or is not a an adoptive parent yes what I want to understand is because in the Judgment you say it should be guided the decision must be guided by the facts of the case yes um should we adopt the facts route or should we have a a criteria or a test that should be applied um to to actually order somebody who is not a biological parent or or an adoptive parent to support the children yeah I I I have said in the Judgment when you when you just ordinarily help out your your partner or your new your your new spouse who has got other children um you you don't necessarily attract the duty by that but the moment you place yourself in a local parenti position my proposition is that you then attract that Duty so there is that principle and and I'm saying the question whether you then assumed the position of being a parent is a matter to be determined by the merits of a case so there is a principle which whether it applies to that specific incidents would be determined by the facts that that's my ruling no no thanks it was Progressive because in the in the pension law space when you're dealing with um death benefits similar approach um is is actually adopted and I think it was well received in the in the family space thank you very much CJ commissioner thank you chief justice um good evening uh justice tar good evening commissioner I must first uh express my uh appreciation of your position uh in the bench every time I've appeared uh in front of you I've been treated with a lot of cesy and respect thank you you're welcome uh and also your independent mindedness I've never seen you as someone who just follows the crowd for the sake of it you you always have a different take to things which can only enrich the the Judiciary um the objection by Mr Amos came to us we dismissed it you don't have to worry about it thank you commissioner and then the criticism just on the issue that you were discussing with uh professor marai um I mean there is a a tension I think between the desire to develop the law to reach a just outcome right and the constraints of the legal process and I think that's what you are grappling with unfortunately the you you've been criticized and unfortunately I have to ask you the extent to which you will take heed of that criticism there are three aspects on which you've been criticized one is your failure to stick to the pleadings of the case to decide things that are not in the pleadings the second is to make political statements uh I speaking for myself I actually enjoyed reading the statements in your judgment so it was all entertaining to read but they say that's wrong because you may create a a feeling to to the reader or one of the parties that you are actually partisan and the third one is giving an order against a party who is a nonp party so you you impose an order on the premier impose an order on the mayor but none of those were actually parties in front of you so I just want to ask on those three things and those are part of what I refer to as the legal process which is constraining and many many lawyers will say that constraint is necessary for the rule of law whether or not in the next judgment you will take heed of those or because I was I was very worried when I listened to the exchange with Professor marai felt to me that in the next judgment you would do the same thing and I I I have indicated to say look um you you learn um as as I say with with long shorts I I have learned that um sometimes um it may not be received in the same way that that that you're kicking it and and it's a it's a lesson for me W with regard to uh the the the pleaded facts of a case as as I indicated one should bear in mind that I never had before me the case of the executive mayor versus the DPP that's why there is no judgment on that matter it is it is a case that developed on appeal and and I'm ready to leave with that um because of what with hindsight I realize I could and should have done so so I've learned from that so so that this deals with the question of whether I I dealt with the pleaded case or not there was no such um I I was dealing in my view at the time um with an inquisitorial process of how best to help a child in distress um with regard to the to the political stat political statements I I have indicated that yes I I realize um with the comments that that are being made that um look um some approaches people may be sensitive to that and and what one should restrain oneself yes I me not just just totally dispens with them they should have no role in the Judgment exactly yes yes and then the order without Joiner H look I I was in and and I don't want to sound as if I'm defending the matter I'm I'm just taking the Commissioners into my processes of thinking at the time and because remember judgment writing is unlike writing a thesis you you don't always put in all that you have read in a judgment you you you you put things that you think will just convey your thoughts but um look I I had considered cases like Z versus minister of Law and Order and and a discussion of when is a an order final and my impression and understanding of the time was that um if the order is not definitive in the sense that it prohibits a party uh from coming to court to address it uh just like in the context of a rule n the fact that you don't call it so doesn't mean it is not so that that was my thinking process at the time so I'm not I'm not justifying it I'm just taking you through my thought processes to say the totality of the reading of the order in how I phrased it in my view was that it was very clear that there was an opening for the executive mayor to come and deal with the law and and all the other aspects that related to the order and obviously I've taken cognition of what the full court has said you know and and that settles it so which which means what that you you you may not in the future give an order without Joiner I I would not yes yes now I just want to ask you then a substantive legal question and I was very pleased to hear uh as an uh making it uh suppose praising you for your stance on customer law but there's complication uh in the division where you are I mean there's one thing which is is the law promoting chiefly law in other words promoting the interest of traditional leaders or is the law promoting customary law in other words customer law from below but in your division in particular there is a complication of the Reconstruction of tribal identities so what you find is you you find people with no clear uh tribal identity they they just name themselves as Chief senso and you see them protesting outside of the Western Cape division saying I'm a chief because there are certain benefits to being a chief so I just wonder whether there is any thought that you've given substantively in into how the law can recognize legitimate chienes and legitimate traditional authorities as opposed to the fly by nights that emerge now because there are benefits to to chft in fact you should know the case the lisp case it was in your division this very issue arose how do you think that issue should be dealt with by the law yeah look um disputes about what traditional leadership is and or who's the rightful leader as well as questions of um what is the customary law on that point um they they are very complex because um they they force one to go into to our history and and um so so it's a it's a it's a very complex question I I'm afraid from where I'm sitting I I have to kind of disappoint you commissioner toi to say um because of the complexity of of of the question one would obviously seek guidance from um what what the Constitution itself says and to the extent that other judgments especially judgments of the of the Superior Courts your SCA and the conal court have said on the approach to be adopted in in dealing with these questions but they they are not easy ones they they are very complex yes but the this is all settled law about how you establish rules of custom yes so that's what I'm trying to get want you to outline bearing in mind your professed expertise in the subject which has impressed uh Chief Nan yes um look you you you you first look at um what what is being said to be to be the legal position and and um you you you look at um the the available um uh case law to say uh is this principle in line with the Constitutional ideals for for lack of better terminology what is set out in the in the Constitution and and you have to F that the last step I mean once you've established the rule of custom then you you check its validity I'm just at the first stage of establishing the custom itself which is really the the issue that the judgment is R felt but it's been followed since thereafter I understand once you've done that you then must test it for constitutional validity I accept that yes I'm still just at the first stage to say how how do you establish that this is the custom precisely yes um you you you I'm I'm I'm trying to have a a collection and try to align my answer to the to the terminology in the in the in the case but I my recollection no you don't need to I mean it's too late it's halfast 9 thank you for for your answer my recollection fails me no problem yes thank you CJ can I can I follow up do you have to I think it's important that I do CJ will will your question advance I think it's important that I do c I really think is important t i I want to take you to the the decision that I that I that I spoke to you about yes um because it came out in when when when commissioner toi was leing up to to his questioning um I think it's important to to to to highlight that in the Judgment that I I spoke to you about there you got the law absolutely right um you started first by indicating that the common law does not recognize the situation yes then later on in the Judgment you made reference to section 28 of the Constitution yes which deals with the best interest of the child and that was a your source of protecting the children under those circumstances and anyone who criticizes you on your approach it's either one they don't understand the methodology of family law or they're not familiar with how care and parental responsibilities are actually established and I thought that was important for me to highlight thank you very much CJ just to tidy up judge T you you've been a member of the advisory committee of the law Reform Commission and the magistrates commission yes and you led the magistracy for many years under the opes of joasa of which you ultimately became president that is correct C and you have been an very active member of the International Association of Judges which we will host in a conference in Cape toown later this week yes it starts on this weekend CJ and you were elected as Africa's representative to the special rorer on the independence of the Judiciary at the United Nations that is correct CJ okay last one what happened to that Reserve judgment you listed in your questionnaire was it has been delivered now CJ when um I can't recall but it was soon thereafter I can't recall the exact date but it was it was delivered okay thank you very much uh judge T thank you CJ all the best thank you you're excused shall we clear the room please for deliberations e e ouch it's a CET but I have a good brushing routine switch to rlb Electric with rlb paste

bbsnBQa9aIE,Hartbeespoort Dam | Issues of property ownership & Businesses being torched,2024-10-14T19:51:19Z,4173,thanks for staying with us the deputy minister of water and sanitation David matobo has engaged Community representatives to deal with the apparent tensions at pport Dam now the bone of contention appears to be land around the dam and of course some claiming it's being sold others claiming that they're not allowed to buy so let's get more details now about this engagement and speak to the deputy Minister um who joins us live now Deputy Minister good evening to you and thank you so much for your time the story has been going on for quite some time now what did you find when you got there um thank you very much what what we did find today is that the community has been divided by the matters that have happened over some time with incidents of violence where certain people were beaten up even one was beaten in a front of a child certain businesses were tossed down and which is assen and criminality but the center they were complaining about the issues of access to the water in the dam including the economic opportunities that were them because as the government we made a decisive choice that in as much as the dam is more than 100 years old and most of the dams in the main they were used for irrigation Mining and others we abolish that particular policy and short that we open up many people were nor were always White they got access to this dam for 99 yeares and black people there was no opportunity to come in we made a decisive intervention about two years ago we abolished the 999 year Lees but there are those who welcome the opportunity that then we can include black people but others wanted to retain the status quo they took us to court and they courts even the highest court in the land and to make a decision in favor that redress and addressing inequalities around the issues of infrastructure and the dams that are there is the right thing to do then we are entering into new L agreements that are them and will be in a position to invite more people not only in years but everywhere in the country but the other issues that we to deal with there are certain not everybody in AR is is a racist there are many Progressive white South Africans who believe in coexistent and co- creation of a common future but we to discuss to say they must stand up and raise their voice and say whatever happen it must not happen under their names therefore there was a clear understanding that they are condemning it it must be dealt with ultimately we agre of creating a structure that will launch which is a multi-stake holder Forum that I will go there with the prim and the other leaders in the beginning of November it will include traditional leaders government ngos environmental organization they will deal with issues of Le agreements they will deal with the issues of economic opportunities because the municipality itself it must be able to regulate allow issues of permits that people are able to do businesses one of the complaint by certain people where was issues of noise pollution and you could see these are the issues about trading hours when do you trade what are the things that you do being considerate but then the dam itself while they were fighting over the dam there's a big issue that this important D is being polluted it has we have to deal with the issues of restoring the pristine nature of that particular de therefore we work with those communities work with other parts of our government stop the pollution that is normally coming from Hing impacting of this biodiversity including affecting the man in terms of quality but are the pardon me pardon me Deputy Minister are the white um you know business owners residents around there who simply did not agree to work with black people in the first place or even allow them um to be part of economic activity are they willing now to be part of the structure that you say you want to put in place or even efforts to try and deal with what's going on there they've all agreed they've all agreed to move to create a platform to take the first step is one of the most important thing that has happened there even when the emotions were very high certain people using certain languages that you could see it has undertone whether it is cyly or over racism but at the end of the day after we allow them the opportunity to ventilate they all agree to say they are going to coexist they will create a future of prosperity that particular area it has the biggest opportunity for them it's an endowment therefore cooperation is the only way to go but at the very same time they want you to work with government and other organization there are incidents that have happened where government have given black people some leases then some of them they were being stopped by certain people just to access a Serv to go on the other side but they even prepared to say what has happened it has embarrassed them they want to work together even to assist one of the black business person to actually rebuild the infrastructure that was damaged there is that commitment but the Journey of Thousand Miles have to begin with this one step yeah and we'll continue to track this one and see if you're able to win um this battle going into the future but there's something else um that has you know been of course sparking an interest in people um you know for people rather in the past couple of days and that is the the testing of colera for example in the water at wsel Dam sha renica Christiana Buckley West Caravan Park as well as duas we what's the latest there the the latest is that we have issued warnings it is a normal random test that we do but at the very same time we don't want people to be alarmed we still want people to be provided water whether it is tankering they must be able to get water from the right areas where water must be abstracted in the that water has been tested but the water must come out from the TS we saying our people at this stage please avoid actually drinking water from systems that are not mpal system because we will not be able to guarantee we know that the load in terms of corera in Terms that you can find some of the strain is because some of the people they might have a load of eoli but at the very same time because we have never been having sufficient flows these are some of the issues that were monitoring but very shortly our team will give us the latest reports because we must keep citizens aware there is of course the issue of reservoir levels in hting um you know being of course of grave concern for some and there's issue of leaks as well some saying that if this is not properly managed um we may then find a Hing without water is that the case that's definitely the case today we had a meeting convened by the PR of the province he has taken a keen interest they prioritized water with r water we engage with municipalities today we have agreed on a 9-point plan in the main because of the inclement weather condition there's High usage we picked up in all the municipalities in Hing and that is not sustainable because we have allowed rain water to abstruct more than their license they are taking more than 5 billion liters a day that they treat and give it to Hing municipalities anding municipalities they are losing more than two two billion L of water on the ground that does not go there therefore we have agreed that we will impose water restriction no government employees are allowed to water all these parks and all other issues in terms of facilities our own citizens their relationship with water must change they can't be watering their Gardens during the morning until in the afternoon those who are using car was they can't be used in the hor pipes will monitor it even do issues of law enforcement but they lose what when they lose water there's an agreement that what they will do the people are going to fix leaks those leaks must be fixed within 24 hours they can't be waiting for a week when there's a ging P then they must also balance their issues of availability of electricity because there's a lot of tripping that is happening then the the reservoirs are are correct some of them they critical they are very low our teams are monitoring them in the morning and in the afternoon so that they can balance the system but working together with government and the citizens of housing we have the capacity to be able to manage our water usage while at the very same time we are waiting for the rains to come but where we stand the system is still very in a healthy state but if we don't change our relationship we might be able to make the system more vulnerable you speak about restrictions when do they come in immediately so as of tonight we have actually said they were imposed but other municipalities have not been imposing them B but at the very same time the operators of the water system they must use the pressure reducing valves so we can be able to do that and then they can be in a position to know when is the pck time to pump more and not to pump more monitor the Reser because one of the problem ining we don't have sufficient reservoirs that can give us enough L time in terms of storage and all the Mayors are directed to speed up those projects but at the very same time other people are living in valys and Hills here and if it is in a high Ling area you need a pump so the pump station will be able to push water when it is below 60% but um even tomorrow we'll meet with the premier and the other stakeholders so we can enforce this message and we will also be communicating more and we have the capacity as a country to do what Cape Town did when they were faced with water challenges all right King to hear how that engagement then with the premere um you know unfolds and see what what happens in that regard and whether people are also heeding the SC um of really just using water sparingly and dealing with the issue of leaks but thank you so much for that update do appreciate it that was the deputy minister of water and sanitation

uGhabthz_y8,100 Days of GNU I GNU remains focused on transforming SA economy - Ramaphosa,2024-10-14T18:49:17Z,6113,I am Viva ANC Viva Viv Viva viva viva sap Viva VI Viva ra Young Lions ra ra Young Lions ra comrades bonan I want to greet the leadership of the African National Congress at National level provincial level as well as at regional and local level as well I also greet the leadership of thec women's league thec Youth League the veterans league and also the leadership of our alliance part South African Communist Party Nano comrades this is not a night for celebration this is a night for reflection but more importantly it's a night when we as the leadership of thec a leadership that has also come from our provinces would like to extend our thanks and gratitude to the people of South Africa to the members of the African National Congress to the supporters of the African National Congress but also more importantly to our volunteers who are gathered here tonight 100 years 100 days ago it feels like 100 years already 100 Year days have passed since the members of the government of national Unity were sworn into office the establishment comrades of the gnu was a historic occasion bringing together into one Administration the seventh Administration parties from across the political Spectrum as we mark this moment we reflect on the establishment of the gnu we also reflect on the progress that has been made to bring stability into our country since the 29th May elections yes we reflect on the work that has been done particularly in carrying out the Mandate of the people for transformation inclusive growth and the creation of jobs and on this occasion yes we recognize the decision of the people of South Africa who made it clear to all of us and to the African National Congress that they would like us to work together the results of our elections showed that while acknowledging the progress that has been made during the first three decades of our democracy from 1994 the citizens of South Africa are deeply concerned about the state of our country they are concerned about our economy an economy that has not been growing but also an economy that is not inclusive that does not include everyone the people of our country made it clear that they are concerned about unemployment they are concerned about poverty and the inequality that continues in our country now through the elections the voters expressed their concerned also about the delivery of basic services and the quality of governance importantly the people of South Africa also sent a clear message about the state of the African National Congress itself they said that our movement needed to give full meaning and effect to the whole process of renewal and rebuilding and unity many of our people recognize that yes progress has been made but they also feel that we have not done enough they are not convinced that the advances that we have made will not be reversed today on this day of reflection we must say that having established the government of national Unity we are firm on saying that thec will continue to lead the fundamental transformation of our country and Society whether they like it or not by this is what the ANC has committed itself to and today as we thank our people we also want to assure them that thec remains committed to ensuring that our Manifesto as adopted by the national executive committee and by various structures that Alliance and all will be implemented yes we have had comrades to acknowledge that the outcome of the 2024 elections was a strategic setback for our movement it is the first time since the Advent of democracy that the ANC did not achieve an outright majority at National level and also in some provinces however as the party that received the most votes nationally and in seven provinces we are the ones who our people looked upon to give leadership and to act in the best interest of our our country and its people thec was the first to say we accept the results of the elections and the decision of our people that in itself showed leadership it showed maturity on our part and people have said that in other countries when the governing party loses its majority sometimes they refuse to accept the will of the people La a South Africa that is led by the African National Congress we made it clear that we accept the decision of our people and the will of our people because we respect our people having done so comrades we had a number of choices one of them was whether thec should go into opposition opposition benches because we did not attain 50 + 1% yes when you have not attain 50 + 1% one of your choices is to go into opposition position and see how best you can regain ground one of the choices was to lead to provide leadership to lead a government of national unity and to invite the other parties and say to them as our people have decided let us work together we opted for giving leadership thec could not sit on its Laurels and not do anything to lead this country forward thec has always given leadership to South Africa from 1912 when the ANC was formed that act of forming thec was to give leadership to South Africa the act of drafting and accepting the freedom Charter was giving leadership the act of embarking on the armed struggle was to give leadership and the act of getting into negotiations leading up to the Democratic elections in 1994 was the ANC once again providing leadership and today in 2024 the ANC was called upon to provide leadership and we have provided the leadership and invited all other parties to be part of a government of national Unity that is what the a n c has done to give leadership so comrades we gave leadership to ensure stability we also gave leadership to make sure that we advance transformation and that we address the concerns of our people we agreed that an inclusive government held the best best prospects to move our country forward we saw this as an opportunity to work with other political parties to address the challenges that confront South Africa and comrades as we are not starting today to work with other parties in 1994 UT Nelson Mandela led us in working with other parties we have been working with other parties in a number of provinces we've been working with other parties in our local government institutions so as and where we work with other parties in the end thec not arrogant ly not trying to praise ourselves yes we do provide influence we do provide leadership and we do provide guidance in the interest of the people of South Africa and in doing all this work comrades I would like to thank our negotiators our negotiators who who day and night after the elections and it became clear that we had not won 50 + 1% executed the Mandate of the national executive committee of the African National Congress Construction Construction it is what the African National Congress NEC decided should be done and I want to thank our negotiators who were led by Secretary General way to he worked with other comrades who are here who I will not be able to name because there are so many of of them and we thank them for having made sure that indeed we do come up with a workable agreement a statement of intent that in many ways represents the objectives that our people have and what the African National Congress has been mandated to execute in the interest of our people this this moment comrades is also an opportunity to mobilize across society and across political difference to build a country that is truly United a country that belongs to all who live in it it is an opportunity to take forward the struggle to build a society in which all our people may be able to prosper and to thrive we thank all political parties who agreed to be part of this journey who came together acting in the interest of our country we went into the gnu knowing full well that we have significant ideological and political differences with some of the parties exactly what we had in 1994 in 1994 we went into a government of national Unity with a party that represented apartate our oppressors and we agreed that to take South Africa forward we would work together with them today we are in a GNU with nine other parties and some of those parties we have major ideological differences with we knew that there were fundamental issues on which we differed and that were bound to bring about tensions and strains in the government of national Unity but we also know from many decades of experience that thec comrades has the Strategic Clarity and the political capacity to work alongside a wide range of those in pursuit of progressive goals that is how we work ultimately the Jew and you comrades should not be judged by the political orientation of the parties that constitute this Administration but it should be judged by the impact that it will make on the lives of the poor and working people of South Africa since the elections South Africans from all walks of life have rallied behind the objectives the programs and the work that the gnu has embarked upon but they've largely rallied around the implementation of the statement of intent and both as individuals and through their various trans formations our people have made a commitment to work work alongside the government to build an inclusive economy and already we can see in the surveys there are many surveys that are being published that show that the majority of South Africans have embraced the government of national Unity the majority of South Africans have accepted the notion of the gnu that we should all work together and the people of South Africa are demonstrating their support for the principles and the minimum program that is contained in the statement of intent signed by the parties of the gnu now the surveys also tell us that a number of people are are also warming up to thec they are beginning to say yes we support this movement and comrades this is a moment that we should use to increase the standing of thec this is the moment that we should use to ensure that thec continues to lead Society the people of South Africa still love the African National Congress that is clear they still have a deep love affair with the African National Congress now as members As Leaders we must go out to our people and say give us the love backa love I want your love back that's what we should be doing we should use this moment of the government of national Unity to strengthen the African National Congress we should use the mo this moment to strengthen our branches to rebuild our branches from the bottom Branch by Branch Zone by Zone region by region and Province by province so that the African National Congress so comates this is a moment that we should utilize this statement of intent comr describes the essential features of our national agenda for the next 5 years it provides a platform for the continuation and the intensification of the fundamental transformation of our economy and Society e government of national Unity comrades it's not starting from scratch it is continuing with the work that was done by the African nation Congress in the sixth Administration in the fifth Administration in the fourth Administration and in the first Administration andc thec was working and wayc so that is what we must strengthen the gnu comrades has identified three strategic priorities firstly to drive inclusive growth and job creation each job creation is at the top of our agenda comrade Colin Malachi and thec Youth League proudly led a massive March to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in demand for employment and we support them we stand behind our young people and we applaud them for having led a huge match to the stock exchange we applaud them because much as we have included it in the statement of intent what they are saying is that we want the government of national Unity to speed up the process of job creation so that so that we fulfill what we set out in our Manifesto what we have now done is to make this demand for employment creation to be a priority of the government of national Unity that is an important development oh we are going to uh be diverted uh the Democratic Revol National Democratic Revolution is going to be defeated CI there is now clear acceptance on the priorities of the African na National Congress they are now the priorities of the government of national unity and that is one thing that we must recognize secondly the second priority is to reduce poverty and to tackle the High Cost of Living and to get the nine parties to recognize that yes we must reduce poverty poverty that mainly affects our people is something that we must recognize and appreciate thirdly we said we want to build a capable and ethical developmental State com these priorities are closely aligned to the six priorities areas of thec 2024 Manifesto as they to live priorities so cini the priorities of the gnu are also the priorities of the African National Congress and we now have many people who are in the gnu who are chanting and articulating precisely all all these priorities there is not a single one who is opposed to these priorities now the 100 days since the establishment of the gnu have seen a marked improvement in the confidence among South Africans the sentiment among ordinary people as well as investors is positive investors are saying we are now looking at the economy of South Africa as an economy that can grow because in the end comrades we need to grow this economy this economy must grow so that it can create jobs we need to grow this economy so that we can reindustrialize we need to grow this economy so that we can build new factories so that our people especially young people can get jobs over 35 City Youth League City 35 now comrades the prospects for growth in our economy have really improved we have entered a new era of promise and a new era of hope this is not just based on wishful thinking but on real progress that has been made since the election we have made important progress on the first priority of thec Manifesto which is a jobs plan to put South Africans to work during the 100 days of the gnu government has been working to expand and also to institutionalize the presidential employment simul the expanded Public Works program and other initiatives under the presidential youth employment intervention we want these interventions to grow we want these interventions yes to ensure that those who don't have skills do get skills so that our people can be trained and be able to be employable in the omy of their own countries now these programs that we have we are continuing with will provide income will provide job opportunities as well as skills development for young people and the older people we have signed the public procurement act which includes set aside for women young people and people with disabil ities so we are going to be focusing through imto on ensuring that the procurement there is set aside so that every Department in government both at National provincial and local government they should know that when they go out to procure to buy services to buy Goods they must Focus focus on those set asides for women for young people and for people in with disabilities our Manifesto said that we would protect and uphold the hard one rights of workers we said we would continually strive to improve the working and living conditions of the working people of our country now since the LA the 100 days days the Department of Employment and labor has undertaken a proactive program of inspecting workplaces by from workplace to workplace this is to ensure that the employers comply with the labor laws of our country they comply with the minimum wage and the safety conditions and we applaud the department of labor and employment in what they are doing because it is wrong that so many workplaces that we visited including large companies have such Lex approach to the rights of workers and our labor laws and City a labor department go ahead and go and inspect a number of companies so that they must be brought to book South Africa and they must comply with the labor laws of our country we have done much work in giving effect to the second priority of the manifesto which is to build an inclusive economy through industrialization and infrastructure development now as part of our response to covid-19 we put in place the economic recovery plan during the sixth Administration so as to deal with the impact of that devastating pandemic and we have now continued We are continuing to make sure that we focus on any infrastructure and working together with our social Partners we are beginning to see the green shoots of an economy that is on the road to recovery and through the effective implementation of our energy action plan in load shedding we are now seeing the you know it way behind us isabo eload shading and we thank our comrades who've been working on this this is part of the progress that is continuing we have made important strides to make sure that we keep the lights on and Es escom continues to implement the things that it needs to work on so comrades in many many ways we are also focusing on the issue of corruption corruption is being focused on in a more focused ways and in doing so comrades we are advancing what we set out in the statement of intent and we are focusing on a number of economic reforms reforms that were started in the sixth Administration through operation vind which in many ways was also initiated by comrade Tito boeni who sadly has passed away and we want to honor him by ensuring that the work that he started continues in bringing about the reforms that are necessary uh in our economy now as we continue to engage with investors we want them to focus on the productive side of the economy we are implementing our industrial policy with renewed Vigor yes we want to make sure that we get to a point where the minerals that we mine in our country are beneficiated so that we no longer export soil rocks and dust we export finished products and that message is sinking we even dealt with that message at the United Nations we are dealing with it at the African Union we are dealing with it in sadak and we are going to make sure that yes it becomes a reality that there is beneficiation and our industrial policy supports this whole process of beneficiation so comrad we continue to ensure that the Africa Continental free trade area where we are going to be able to export many many Goods to the rest of our continent continues we want to make sure that we trade with our African sister countries and that is part of growing our economy and making sure that indeed we we do get an economy that is growing the third priority of our Manifesto was to tackle the High Cost of Living we are beginning to see some relief for consumers with regard to the prices of basic Goods we have seen the reduction in the petrol price due in part to the strengthening of the land and the setting up of the government of national Unity also contributed to the strengthening of the r and that in leads to the decrease of a number of import prices particularly petrol and that is why we have also seen the reduction in the petrol price while there's been a decline in some food prices the competition commission has noted that there are some food prices that are still high and comrades we continue in a number of other areas to ensure that we introduce new ways of doing things for instance the school nutrition program which feeds over 9 million children we are grateful that the department of basic education is now going to add another meal breakfast as a meal to feed our children that too represents progress and the our government will continue with the SRD uh fund to make sure the SRD Grant and we expect that we will be advancing to another level of a grant and we are calling on government to make sure that we expedite this another progress area has been in improving the Commuter Rail lines irasa has not been working very hard to make sure that our commuter lines or Runway lines and passengers are now beginning to go back to using rail the trains and we now see millions of our commuters going back to utilizing the trains that is the progress that was started in the sixth administ Administration and it continues those reforms are going ahead so comrades we also want to see an improvement in the quality of basic services that are given to our people basic services such as water Refuge collection and we are going to be making sure that our municipalities do give our people people good basic Services what our counselors and our Mayors should focus on improving the services that they deliver to our people we are pleased that Ur and in Johannesburg they have new ANC Mayors and we applaud them and we wish them the very best so that they can improve Services here in the last 100 days we signed the Bella act the basic education law Amendment now the new legislation is going to ensure that we improve our education system we also ensure that there is access to education right across the board without any form of discrimination without any form of preventing our children from entering into any of the schools in our country but it is also going to make sure that yes we focus on early childhood development they must start being educated from as early as 4 years old they must start going to schools and we are going to proceed with that and of course in executing the B act we have allowed a period a very brief period of 3 months to finalize two provisions and that is a process in which negotiations and we want the ANC to also get involved in those negotiations so that we can get an education system that can save all our children we also signed the nhi act nhi that is going to ensure that there is equal access to health has been signed into law and is our implement hi we are just making sure that those who may well have had issues come forward but we want to make it clear that we are going to implement the National Health System at the same time we continue to engage with everyone several ministers in the gnu have been working with provinces and local government in the spirit of Cooperative governance to resolve a number of issues and we should applaud that at the same time we will continue to make efforts to ensure that thec deployers in all levels of government do their work whether they are ministers whether they are mec's whether they are Premier whether they are counselors they must continue continue doing their work we've also said that we must strengthen the monitoring and evaluation in thec so comrades the gnu gives us a great opportunity and a great moment so that we can advance the interests of our people and we are also bringing about influence on the all the other members of the gnu so that we continue to protect and Advance the rights of the those who are vulnerable in society including children the elderly persons with disabilities and and we are committed to upholding the rights of members of the lgbtqia a plus Community now October is an important month to the lgbtqia A Plus Community they held their October M October Pride March and we congratulate Soto on the 20th anniversary of its Pride March and welcome The Pride march across the country to advance the rights of those communities that are vulnerable particularly against homophobia the emancipation of women comrades remains one of the cornerstones of our society that we wish to advance and to build a and we celebrate achievements that are taking women to a higher level of leadership we celebrate also for instance the appointment and the inauguration of the country's first female Chief Justice in South Africa that is a moment that we should celebrate at the same time we must intensify our efforts to end it gender based violence and femicide hbv comrades must not only be the task of thec women's league it must be our Collective task where we call upon men to respect the women of our country so that we get rid of gender based violence in South Africa we must also in the end reduce and remove the gender pay Gap because we still find that in a number of places women are paid less than men and we say to companies get rid of that bad practice pay women who do exactly the same work as men exactly the same we must work together to reverse the recent dip in the representation of women in our Parliament also in number of formations of government in Parliament now we see being less a lesser number of women we need to attend to that we welcome the Vigor with which a minister of police and the criminal justice system as a whole are moving to tackle crime and Corruption and we welcome the cooperation that is taking place with communities with business with private security companies on effective crime prevention strategies we are making Headway across the criminal justice system in our fight against corruption yes against criminality we continue to implement yes the various recommendations of the of State capture commission and we will keep the pressure on we will leave no quarter unmoved we make made a commitment comrades to build an accountable ethical and professional public service we can see progress through the leadership of Institutions like the Public Service Commission the auditor general the public protector and the national school of government and as part of the sixth Administration or thec six priority Manifesto we are working to build a better Africa and a better world much of our International commit engagements over the past 100 days have been about expanding economic diplomacy wherever our ministers have gone from comrade Lula from comrade paow and others they have been going around the world campaigning for economic progress in our country and we've been making progress in opening up many other markets through bricks and through agoa and through various bilateral relations so our commitment to making sure that we have a multilateral world is unchallenged we will continue to do so and we welcome the decisions that have also been taken by the United Nations to make sure that we reform the UN particularly its Security Council and we will continue comrades to advance the African agenda and we will continue to ensure that we support the people of Palestine in the next few days we will be submitting our full case to the international court of justice in support of the people of Palestine against the genocide that is being committed to the people of Palestine particularly in Gaza we also comrades May are concerned about the bombings that have been taking place by Israel in the nearby countries like leban on and we call on the World to put pressure on Israel to desist from all these attacks that they have been leveling against neighboring countries and we call for the immediate ceasefire that should take place yes in Gaza and the release of hostages and also making sure that humanitarian assistance does get through climate change continues to be a major problem and some of our provinces here continue to experience it the government of national Unity has taken this task up with climate change with a great deal of vigor and we are going to make sure that we do protect our people particularly those who continue to suffer from the disasters climate disaster Masters that take place now comrades 100 days does not seem like a long time but it is a significant Milestone to gauge whether we are moving in the right direction or whether we are doing things differently and with more purpose our Reflections the reflections that we are making at this point in time that although though our challenges are huge there is collective commitment to working together to tackle these challenges and those who say we should not be working together with others need to come forward with Alternatives Alternatives that they believe can work and thus far we have not heard of any better option or alternative and that is why we will continue to work with the nine political parties as the African National Congress in the government of national Unity because the government of national Unity has brought about stability political stability in our country and it is giving a real meaningful promise for economic growth where investors are beginning to look at our country once again with greater interest both local and foreign investors because in the end comrades we need to work on improving our economy there is a firm commitment to advance towards building a better life for all our people the commitment to advance towards building a better life is also shared by many people who want to participate in the National dialogue the idea of a national dialogue has now been broadly accepted the national dialogue will be an important moment where we will get our people to participate through their various formations be it political parties religious organizations traditional organization sporting organizations cultural organizations educational organizations you name them we will want them to participate in discussing the state of our nation and also in chanting a way forward for South Africa so we are looking forward to the holding of the national dialogue so that we can take South Africa forward we should always comes remind ourselves of the words of the great African Freedom Fighter Amar cabal who would have turned 100 years uh if he had continued to live when he said we must always remember that the people are not fighting of struggling for ideas the ideas that are in your head the people fight and accept the sacrifices demanded in order to gain material advantages to live better to live in peace to benefit from progress and for the better future of their children so our people are not trying to fight for what is in the heads of leaders they want real progress they want jobs they want to lead a better life they want poverty to be obliterated in South Africa they want inequality to come to an end not they want real things now comrades our country has entered a new era and it is an important era yes it's an era full of challenges it is an era that is also full of risks but it is also an era that is full of possibilities as thec we are determined to seize these opportunities to advance the need needs and the interests of the people of South Africa we are determined to advance the fundamental social and economic transformation of our society as we Mark a 100 days of the government of national Unity we once again call on all South Africans to join us to do more together City wasan come and work with us and we are grateful that nine parties responded positively to the invitation that we issued to come and join us to form a government of national Unity to stabilize our country to take our country forward we say my let us work together this is a moment for all South Africans to work together to advance the interest of South Africa African National Congress long live the African National Congress long live long live long live the gnu long live and that is ANC president sir Raposa there wrapping his address a comprehensive reflection on the achievements as he calls them of the government of national Unity saying that this is a night of reflection and saying that this is the first time um thec did not receive an outrage majority and was then for for to of course share power um with other political parties saying that this was a sign of maturity um for thec and saying that the fact that there's a government of national Unity is a sign of leadership and saying the parties have had to compromise um when it comes to the different positions and saying that many South Africans according to him have embraced the government of national unity and saying that this is the ANC asking for what it calls a love back as they are now going to ensure um that they their Deyes whether at Municipal level at provincial government level or at national government level in whatever capacity they need to ensure that they do their job and they continue then to provide services for the people of South Africa and do better when it comes to the positions that they would be deployed to and saying that the municipalities need to ensure that they do deliver basic services to the people of South Africa this as thec is reflecting on the 100 days um of the government of national Unity varying views of course about um this particular Arrangement you do speak to some who say that this is a grand Coalition While others are saying that this is indeed a government of national Unity but um marking just over 100 days since the constituting of the seventh Administration there shortly after the elections in May for
2wIjqfVrIis,Police conduct a raid in Durban CBD - KZN Premier Thami Ntuli,2024-10-14T18:35:17Z,9562,operation is a very important one which uh is conducted by uh different sectors of government but at the center are the police uh the saps of wasu natal and also the Metropolis of Metro the purpose in fact was one H to deal with crime uh and even people here were building were mushrooming uh the shelters illegally where in a lot of illegal activities are taking place the issue of the drugs uh exchange taking place and even as some of the undocumented foreign Nationals they were finding their home here uh today the police have been able in fact to H find discover 15 undocumented foreign Nationals in one of the oper in one of the buildings here and here you could see that uh people who were here more than 200 in a very space small space uh who have built their shelters using the Plastics the black Plastics and different materials uh which is quite very unfortunate for the city uh to have such a bad image which will discourage in fact even the tourists and the investors I think it's an operation which is ongoing which you are going to see going on because we are saying Inu natal there is no place where one for criminals there is no place for undocumented foreign Nationals every criminal and every undocumented foreign National must must know that this province does not belong to them they must leave was natal or they must rather stop doing crime and they must go back to their countries and look for the documents so that they would be here officially like all others who are here officially in fact it's a a campaign against a crime and cleaning gu natal our operation is not in fact solely targeting the foreign naal however we saying we cannot Overlook also that one because that is another element which is making the pro of natal not to be what the people of natal want to see but at the same time our operations we also visit shops to ensure that they sell food which is not expired like we have seen cases of children dying because of the food that they buy in Sp shops uh in fact even the ordinary criminals like the other operation that we we made here we the police were able to arrest someone who ran away after raping someone in one of the townships here that person was not a foreign National we're not targeting foreign Nationals we are targeting crime as natal we saying we are hard in crime as we have heard that in the actually assassinations that have recently taken place people are being arrested that and people who try to sh shoot at the police the police are able to react successfully I think natal despite the fact that we still have high levels of crime but the work that is done by the police and other departments who are that are cooperating with the police is quite really commendable e
tVC7vWaoNBk,Coping with work stress - Dr Keitumetse Mashego shares more,2024-10-14T18:32:48Z,620,last week the World Health Organization observed a mental health day and the theme was mental health at work it highlighted that safe healthy working environments can act as a protective factor for mental health just last week a young police officer in Johannesburg committed suicide allegedly due to bullying at the workplace let's get more on this now and how to cope with work stress from Dr Gumi maso a clinical psychologist thank you so much for your Time Dr mashiko uh I mean we always you know joke about the fact that um you know corporate culture is so toxic that it will drive you to take Extreme Measures but the reality actually is that it will and that some environments do lead to long-term stress that affects one's mental uh Health which manifests into physical health what are the most common signs of work related stress uh do you think are out there uh good afterno and good afternoon to the listeners um you know what usually uh presents as uh stress is usually physical symptoms without the physical cause so you get people who are having somatic complaints continually such as stomach problems or you know headaches that are never ending or you know even things like your biological things or natural things that are not happening like sleep uh disruption in appetite disruption in you know just someone feeling comfortable in their skin so those are some of the symptoms in that they present as stress but stress over time can lead to what we call burnout where someone really has nothing left to give so with stress it's different to burnout in that when someone is stressed they can sort of see some light at the end of the tunnel and how to get out of situation or think about ways to cope but with burnout it's where someone feels like they have nothing left to give and when someone is burnout usually you know uh that's where we it's not necessarily a mental health disorder but it has requires significant attention in that it can co-occur with things like your anxiety and depression as well and I mean I want to stay on that point of burnout uh how does it present itself and and and more importantly what are some of the things that you need to do before you actually get to that point sadly you know in the work environment whatever it is that we haven't dealt with we bring to the office so even the employers are going through things that they're not dealing with that they're sometimes projecting or because of the expectations you know from the executive they also have their own things so you also get people just in the workplace carrying whatever it is that they carry that they haven't dealt with whether it's traumas or you know financial problems emotional stress you know people carry whatever is that they haven't dealt with with them all the time so that mixed with a lot of work stress can lead to what we term burnout and this is where as I said someone really feels like they have nothing left to give so they feel like they are running on empty and it could lead to them for example withdrawing not uh when they wake up in the morning they don't look forward to going to work when they are at work maybe before they were productive nowadays they just cannot be productive there's poor concentration just constant fatigue just uh even the cognitions or the things that they say or think about they just seem like it's all doom and gloom so they basically it can present as if it's depression but it's not the same as depression because of its severity but nonetheless it does require attention in that the person feels so hopeless and helpless and as if they have nothing left to give they see no way out of that situation and to what extent then because you mentioned the employer to what extent does you know workplace culture play a role in exacerbating you know some of the stressful um situations because on the one hand you have this young police officer who's being bullied at work who then commits suicide you also have these um highly stress environments where people need to meet certain targets you know from uh sales teams Etc that might also then experience uh this um these feelings of of um of mental health so so how how big a role is then work um culture definitely work culture plays a role where people you know uh you tend to see a trend where people are not coping and also because people are not the same you know we get people who are more resilient than others some are predisposed to uh mental health challenges some are not so we need to understand that just because one person is coping in a toxic environment doesn't mean that you know others will cope as well so we need to understand that a toxic environment can exacerbate mental health challenges but they will not necessarily present in everyone in that people are wired differently but a toxic environment or an unhealthy uh work environment can definitely uh you know uh uh exacerbate someone's experience of hopelessness and depression and burnout Etc so it's really important that the employer or the people in charge become aware that the mind is so powerful that you know for people to perform their mind actually needs to be functional but if they're having mental health challenges it's going to be so difficult for someone to actually be uh productive and we need to really put this message out there that mental health illnesses or challenges or difficulties are something that can happen to someone to anybody because some people are predisposed to so we really need to promote the culture in society of seeking help but also to show Grace for people who are struggling to understand that people are not wired the same and really that if the mind is not functional we cannot expect the body or the person to actually deliver so we really need to really reduce the stigma around mental health illnesses understanding that not everyone can just snap out of it people are not you know uh meant to snap out of these things because it's actually uh sometimes a brain chemistry thing meaning the neurotransmitters are not doing what they're supposed to be doing so people need intervention sometimes they need medication sometimes they need time off of the toxic environment yeah and I mean you you talk about the mind being so powerful having to know all of these things um I mean I think a lot of people are now more educated around just some of the big stresses I mean with the world becoming so highly Technical and technologically inclined um you know the world of AI and very hyperconnected what then can businesses do to you know create environments that are welcoming and and also that um you know include uh people to have safe spaces if I can call it that because there are environments that are very much uh dangerous um you know saps um I would imagine also other um environments I can name a few including journalists um environments but what then can workplaces do to create those environments using technology to our advantage you know to make people feel a little bit more less stressed if I can call it that yeah I think there is really a need to um you know create safe spaces in that they should be you know employee Wellness but you know employee Wellness also has its own uh limitations in that people don't trust it they don't want to use the internal uh you know resources available they would prefer external services so uh so that's also quite a tricky one whereby you you you do I think uh mental health professionals should be identified or should there should be a list where people can choose those so the uh employers need to really uh uh make sure that there's budget to cover for mental health illnesses but not when there's a crisis just for people to have checkins to ensure that they can see their own blind spots to have coping strategies in order to cope with life but also with work so that they can deliver so it should be prioritized the same way we get people you know have gyms in the workplaces we really need to find ways to make it work when it comes to AI it's it's a bit difficult because I think people still want the human element so even with online interventions I know that my clients sometimes would wish to come see me physically it's not always possible so I can imagine also with AI is also quite difficult but I think what we can do is just to demonstrate how the mind works because when I do my session for example in corporates my aim is always to ensure that people understand how the mind works and once you can Master the art of how the subconscious works and how powerful it is in that it determines your reality and your experience and you take charge of that instead of looking at it from a victim you know uh perspective but from a perspective that I need to understand this thing because this mind is so powerful it to determine how I finished in this life and my experiences because I cannot control other things but my mind definitely I can control so I think it's really about empowering people to understand how the subconscious mind which is 90% of the Mind influences our behaviors our reactions our actions you know the things we say the things we do with other people how we relate with people and actually begin

_ALnfPHxEfQ,JSC Interview | Judge Patricia Goliath's leadership style questioned: Alison Tilley shares more,2024-10-14T18:17:25Z,5494,at this hour we take you to the JSC where Ken manga is standing by to bring us the very latest there it was a difficult day in office for judge Goliath who's the acting president of the Western Cape High Western Cape Division and of course at the same time you saw the developments in orange farm Calvin Luda is standing by to wrap the day for us there because seven people were shot and including um the Tav owner who turned the gun onto himself so he's got all the very latest from there but of course is here to tell us what's coming up in sport B we're not great news especially for Continental football the super Eagles of Nigeria have said they will not take part in their 2025 afcon qualifier against Libya they have alleged mistreatment from the Libyan Football Association saying they were stranded in an airport for hours on end without any food any Wi-Fi any connectivity and therefore they want to go back to their home which is Nigeria and they've even said through their Captain William trer Kong that they're willing to give their points to Libya if this is the mistreatment that they will get so we will be speaking to vandu a bit later on just to find out the latest in terms of that feud between Nigeria and Libya I'm kondo with your latest and sporting news all right we begin with this as the judicial Service Commission searches for the next judge president of the Western Cape High Court division the leadership style of the current acting judge president has been called into question Patricia Goliath is the first candidate to be interviewed for the role a position previously held by Dr John kin who was impeached from that office by a majority vote a few months short of completing two years as the acting judge president judge Goliath saw concerns around her leadership style thrust into the spotlight refuting allegations of a troubled division let's get the very latest now we speak to Kenny mapanga SBC news reporter Kenny of course a difficult day in office for judge Goliath and of course if anything is to go by it doesn't seem like um you know the JSC members were in fact convinced by some of what she says that she has done so far in order to try and restore um faith in that division but also the same time to deal with the issues of tensions and good afternoon to you bonga and to the viewers at home of course the task of finding essentially what is the successor of Dr John CL that is the judge president of the Western Cape is not an easy task for the Judicial Service Commission because it's not only about how well you write judgments your your understanding of the law or how you meet the transformation targets but essentially you're going into a division with a rich history quite a difficult history had uh two leadership positions sparring against one another and counter complaints then of course is riddled with troubles and divisions so of course this leadership role is a different one and of course when they consider this role they have to look at those various factors judge padria GTH has been acting as the judge president of that particular Division and when she arrived this morning she painted an image of a court that is stabilized in her close to two years serving as that acting position of Judge president rather however if we look at the complaints or rather the comments that were submitted by a senior judge of that very same division we get quite a stark contrast to the image she was presenting and to discuss this further I am judged by or joined rather by Alison Tilly of Judges matter that is the judicial Watchdog that pays a close attention to the Judiciary and all its inner workings including an important process such as the JC quite a day for judge Patricia Goliath not what she could have expected this morning when she arrived for That interview that was a marathon of close to 4 hours to be centered on the floors uh surrounding her leadership style it was a very long interview and we know that that's not a good sign uh there were a number of issues raised before we even got here uh there had been a request for accusal of the judge who had been going to sit in on this process which is why judge gamble is here and not judge arasmus so I think uh everybody knew ahead of time that it was going to be difficult but the the the level the depth the the range of issues that were raised uh really really made it a really difficult interview I mean let's go through these issues one by one I think we can start at probably the lightest issue which is uh her using her position as acting judge president to designate a particular candidate to act for the Western Cape in these interviews uh resulting in judge arasmus having to recuse themselves as well as the request for commissioner noesi to remove himself or recuse himself from this very process as well because of the affiliation to nadell and creating the impression that um she seemingly what was perceived as creating a JC panel that would have been designed according to her for her particular interview which was a serious cause of concern for the Commissioners yes it was um the issue around Mr noesi was as the president of nadell and the issue of nadell came up a number of times uh it seems as though there were concerns from her side as to what Nadal's view was of her and that potentially they had been organizing against her um I think that's one of the issues that we really uh that the commission has to Gra with is whether um see seeing enemies uh seeing uh people who are against you uh that certainly did seem to be a feature um of her interview this this concern with with people who who really out to ghetto and if we look at the history she was Deputy judge president at the time that the counter complaints were laid we now know that Dr John CL has been removed from office but we can see the severe impact uh of this battle between the two had on the division and the stability of the division with candidates even now refusing to divulge the true feelings or that's what it looks like from the interviews that we're seeing regarding the what is exactly is the root issue at the Western Cape division of the high court if you are looking at those interviews as well did you get an impression as to what exactly is the issue here well I think the the Chief Justice said that and and it was in relation to Jud CR you that that people were tap dancing around the issue and I think it was it's obviously very difficult to come straight out and name a person as being responsible for the trouble at the Western Cape High Court partly because it's no one person uh there are a range of people there's plenty of blame to go around but what what certainly judge Goliath was asked about a lot is why things in the division seem to have sort of become Frozen in Time that there were whether it's something which seems relatively trivial like a a meeting that wasn't ever minuted and that was a decision from before when uh she was acting Deputy it's a decision she's continued with while she's acting JP it seems like a simple matter to say well we're going to have minutes of this meeting because all all meetings should be minuted and the minutes made available to the participants um but such a simple matter um was one that she got stuck on and it seemed to be a difficulty around making decisions taking new positions um really getting to grips with the challenges in the division rather seemed like she was a placeholder wanting to just keep things in place until change came in the form of a of a new judge president considering that there last uh or the first two candidates that was the acting JP and the acting djp uh could not really demonstrate to the JSC how they would lead the court through their acting stent uh what is at stake for the candidate that is going to be recommended going into that division knowing the challenges that the division has had over time which I think Dr lope has spoken about before what is at stake for that particular candidates that might be recommended by the JC look it's uh I I don't think there's any getting away from the fact that it's a difficult division with a a difficult history um we know that there are number of very senior judges who are going to be retiring soon the question of where the talent is going to come from is an issue and if people feel that the division is unhappy not conducive not collegial they're not going to want to act there and they're not going to want to apply for permanent possession there so I think it it then does mean that the the knock on effect down the line is that the division is weakened because they're people who don't put themselves forward obviously they're strong candidates uh in in the interviews uh tomorrow for the Wern Cape so uh it's not to say that that you know means that nobody's coming coming forward at all but it's it's going to be an ongoing problem and one of the questions uh that was asked is how long are you going to be in this position um because it's going to take more than a year or two to sort out all right thank you very much Alison Tilly of Judges mattera describing the kind of task that is ahead if the JC chooses to recommend a candidate to fill that top judge post of Judge president of the Western Cape division of the high court following that fractured period for that division of the high court which has been described as troubled now we have seen the fourth candidate of seven candidates that are lined up to be interviewed head to their interview now that is ongoing currently then we can expect tomorrow that the J will continue to look for four judicial vacancies to be filled in the very same Western Cape division of the high court over to you in studio all right thank you very much for that update there's certainly an interesting day at the JC my colleague there Ken mapanga tracking these developments for us

Book of Matthew chapter 19 it's a book that tells the story of what is called the eye of the needle and that story we are told that Jesus told people what they need to do in order to enter the kingdom when he told them what they need to do some of them said in that case nobody will enter and this is what Jesus answered with men this this is impossible but With God all things are possible and we are reminded 30 years ago when we are building this new South Africa one of our elders a wise old man called Nelson Mandela made this statement I quote him it's all it always seems impossible until it is done so what seemed impossible is happening today we are therefore going to pray and after prayer we observe a moment of silence that will be led the prayer will be read by Reverend vilana the moment

our volunteers who are gathered here tonight 100 years 100 days ago it feels like 100 years already 100 Year days have passed since the members of the government of national Unity were sworn into office The Establishment comrades of the gnu was a historic occasion bringing together into one Administration the seventh Administration parties from across the political Spectrum as we mark this moment we reflect on the establishment of the gnu we also reflect on the progress that has been made to bring stability into our country since the 29th May elections yes we reflect on the work that has been done particularly in carrying out the Mandate of the people for transformation inclusive growth and the creation of jobs and on this occasion yes we recognize the decision of the people of South Africa who made it clear to all of us and to the African National Congress that they would like us to work together the results of our elections showed that while acknowledging the progress that has been made during the first three decades ades of our democracy from 1994 the citizens of South Africa are deeply concerned about the state of our country they are concerned about our economy an economy that has not been growing but also an economy that is not inclusive that does not include everyone the people of our country made it clear that they are concerned about unemployment they are concerned about poverty and the inequality that continues in our country now through the elections the voters expressed their concern also about the delivery of basic services and the quality of governance importantly the people of South Africa also sent a clear message about the state of the African National Congress itself they said that our movement needed to give full meaning and effect to the whole process of renewal and rebuilding and unity many of our people recognize that yes progress has been made but they also feel that we have not done enough they are not convinced that the advances that we have made will not be reversed today on this day of reflection we must say that having established the government of national Unity we are firm on saying that thec will continue to lead the fundamental transformation of our country and Society whether they like it or not by this is what thec has committed it's self too and today as we thank our people we also want to assure them that the ANC remains committed to ensuring that our Manifesto as adopted by the national executive committee and by various structures the alliance and all will be implemented yes we have had comrades to acknowledge that the outcome of the 2024 elections was a strategic setback for our movement it is the first time since the Advent of democracy that the ANC did not achieve an outright majority at National level and also in some provinces however as the party that received the most votes nationally and in seven provinces we are the ones who our people looked upon to give leadership and to act in the best interest of our country and its people thec was the first to say we accept the results of the elections and the decision of our people that in itself showed leadership it showed maturity on our part and people have said that in other countries when the governing party loses its majority sometimes they refuse to accept the will of the people La a South Africa that is led by the African National Congress we made it clear that we accept the decision of our people and the will of our people because we respect our people having done so comrades we had a number of choices one of them was whether thec should go into opposition opposition benches because we did not attain 50 + 1% yes when you have not attained 50 + 1% one of your choices is to go into opposition and see see how best you can regain ground one of the choices was to lead to provide leadership to lead a government of national unity and to invite the other parties and say to them as our people have decided let us work together we opted for giving leadership the ANC could not sit on its Laurels and not do anything to lead this country forward the ANC has always given leadership to South Africa from 1912 when thec was formed that act of forming the annc was to give leadership to South Africa the act of drafting and accepting the freedom Charter was giving leadership the act of embarking on the armed struggle was to give leadership and the act of getting into negotiations leading up to the Democratic elections in 1994 was thec once again providing leadership and today in 2024 thec was called upon to provide leadership and we have provided the leadership and invited all other parties to be part of a government of national Unity that is what the ANC has done to give leadership so comrades we gave leadership to ensure stability we also gave leadership to make sure that we advance transformation and that we address the concerns of our people we agreed that an inclusive government held the best prospects to move our country forward with we saw this as an opportunity to work with other political parties to address the challenges that confront South Africa and comrades as we are not starting today to work with other parties in 1994 UT Nelson Mandela led us in working with other parties we have been working with other parties in a number of provinces we've been working with other parties in our local government institutions so and where we work with other parties in the end thec not arrogantly not trying to praise ourselves yes we do provide influence we do provide leadership and we do provide guidance in the interest of the people of South Africa and in doing all this work comrades I would like to thank our negotiators our negotiators who day and night after the elections and it became clear that we had not 1 50 + 1% executed the Mandate of the national executive committee of the African National Congress Construction Construction it is what the African National Congress NEC de decided should be done and I want to thank our negotiators who were led by secretary negotiator he worked with other comrades who are here who I will not be able to name because there are so many of them and we thank them for having made sure that in indeed we do come up with a workable agreement a statement of intent that in many ways represents the objectives that our people have and what the African National Congress has been mandated to execute in the interest of our people this mement comrad is also an opportunity to mobilize across Society and across political difference to build a country that is truly United a country that belongs to all who live in it it is an opportunity to take forward the struggle to build a society in which all our people may be able to prosper and to thrive we thank all political parties who agreed to be part of this journey who came together acting in the interest of our country we went into the gnu knowing full well that we have significant ideological and political differences with some of the parties exactly what we had in 1994 in 1994 we went into a government of national Unity with a party that represented apartate our oppressors and we agreed that to take South Africa forward we would work together with them today we are in a GNU with nine other parties and some of those parties we have made major ideological differences with we knew that there were fundamental issues on which we differed and that were bound to bring about tensions and strains in the government of national Unity but we also know from many decades of experience that the ANC comrades has the Strategic clarity and the political capacity to work alongside a wide range of those in pursuit of progressive goals that is how we work ultimately the Jew and you comrades should not be judged by the political orientation of the parties that constitute this Administration but it should be judged by the impact that it will make on the lives of the poor and working people of South Africa since the elections South Africans from all walks of life have rallied behind the objectives the programs and the work that the gnu has embarked upon but they've largely rallied around the implementation of the statement of intent and both as individuals and through their various formations our people have made a commitment to work work alongside the government to build an inclusive economy and already we can see the surveys there are many surveys that are being published that show that the majority of South Africans have embraced the government of national Unity the majority of South Africans have accepted the notion of the gnu that we should all work together and the people of South Africa are demonstrating their support for the principles and the minimum program that is contained in the statement of intent signed by the parties of the gnu now the surveys also tell us that a number of people are also warming up to thec they are beginning to say yes we support this movement and comrades this is a moment that we should use to increase the standing of the ANC this is the moment that we should use to ensure that the ANC continues to lead Society the people of South Africa still love the African National Congress that that is clear they still have a deep love affair with the African National Congress now as members As Leaders we must go out to our people and say give the love I Want Your Love that's what we should be doing we should use this moment of the government of national Unity to strengthen the African National Congress we should use the mo this moment to strengthen our branches to rebuild our branches from the bottom Branch by Branch Zone by zone region by region and Province by province so that the African National Congress so comrades this is a moment that we should utilize this statement of intent comr describes the essential features of our national agenda for the next 5 years it provides a platform for the continuation and the intensification of the fundamental transformation of our economy and Society e government of national Unity comrades it's not starting from scratch it is continuing with the work that was done by the African National Congress in the sixth Administration in the fifth ad Administration in the fourth Administration and in the first Administration and thec was working and today so that is what we must must strengthen the gnu comrades has identified three strategic priorities firstly to drive inclusive growth and job creation each job creation is at the top of our agenda comrade Colin Malachi and thec youth league proudly led a massive March to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in demand for employment and we support them we stand behind our young people and we applaud them for having led a huge March to the stock exchange we applaud them because much as we have included it in the statement of intent what they are saying saying is that we want the government of national Unity to speed up the process of job creation so that so that we fulfill what we set out in our Manifesto what we have now done is to make this demand for employment creation to be a priority of the government of nation Unity that is an important development we are going to uh be diverted uh the Democratic Revol National Democratic Revolution is going to be defeated cityi there is now clear acceptance on the priorities of the African National Congress they are now the priorities of the government of nation unity and that is one thing that we must recognize secondly the second priority is to reduce poverty and to tackle the High Cost of Living and to get the nine parties to recognize that yes we must reduce poverty poverty that mainly affects our people is something that we must recognize and appreciate thirdly we said we want to build a capable and ethical developmental State com these priorities are closely aligned to the six priorities areas of thec 2024 Manifesto as there to priorities so the priorities of the gnu are also the priorities of the African National Congress and we now have many people who are in the gnu who are chanting and articulating precisely all these priorities there is not a single one who is opposed to these priorities now the 100 days since the establishment of the gnu have seen a marked improvement in the confidence among South Africans the sentiment among ordinary people as well as investors is positive investors are saying we are now looking at the economy of South Africa as an economy that can grow because in the end comrades we need to grow this economy this economy must grow so that it can create jobs we need to grow this economy so that we can reindustrialize we need to grow this economy so that we can build new factories so that our people especially young people can get jobs who are over 35 league5 now comrades the prospects for growth in our economy have really improved we have entered a new era of promise and a new era of hope this is not just based on wishful thinking but on real progress that has been made since the election we have made important progress on the first priority of thec Manifesto which is a job's plan to put South Africans to work during the 100 days of the gnu government has been working to expand and also to institutionalize the presidential employment stimulus the expanded Public Works program and other initi initiatives under the presidential youth employment intervention we want these interventions to grow we want these interventions yes to ensure that those who don't have skills do get skills so that our people can be trained and be able to be employable in the economy of their own countries now these programs that we have we are continuing with will provide income will provide job opportunities as well as skills development for young people and the older people we have signed the public procurement act which includes set asides for women young people and people with disabilities so we are going to be focusing through imped on ensuring that the procurement there is set aside so that every Department in government both at National provincial and local government they should know that when they go out to procure to buy services to buy Goods they must focus on those set asides for women for young people people and for people in with disabilities our Manifesto said that we would protect and uphold the hardw rights of workers we said we would continually strive to improve the working and living conditions of the working people of our country now since the LA the 100 days the Department of Employment and labor has undertaken a proactive program of inspecting workplaces by from workplace to workplace this is to ensure that the employers comply with the labor laws of our country they comply with the minimum wage and the safety conditions and we applaud the department of labor and employment in what they are doing because it is wrong that so many workplaces that we visited including large companies have such Lex approach to the rights of workers and our labor laws and City a labor department go ahead and go and inspect a number of companies so that they must be brought to book they must comply with the labor laws of our country we have done much work in giving effect to the second priority of the manifesto which is to build an inclusive economy through industrialization and infrastructure development now as part of our resp responds to covid-19 we put in place the economic recovery plan during the sixth Administration so as to deal with the impact of that devastating pandemic and we have now continued We are continuing to make sure that we focus on infrastructure and working together with our social Partners we are beginning to see the green shoots of an economy that is on the road to recovery and through the effective implementation of our energy action plan El load shedding we are now seeing the you know it way behind us isabo eload shading and we thank our comrades who've been working on this this is part of the progress that is continuing we have made important strides to make sure that we keep the lights on and escom continues to implement the things that it needs to work on so comrades in many many ways we are also focusing on the issue of corruption corruption is being focused on in a more focused ways and in doing so comrades we are advancing what we set out in the statement of intent and we are focusing on a number of economic reforms reforms that were started in the sixth Administration through operation vinda uh which in many ways was also initiated by comrade dto weni who sadly has passed away and we want to honor him by ensuring that the work that he started continues in bringing about the reforms that are necessary uh in our economy now as we continue to engage with investors we want them to focus on the productive side of the economy we are in implementing our industrial policy with renewed Vigor yes we want to make sure that we get to a point where the minerals that we mine in our country are beneficiated so that we no longer export soil rocks and dust we export finished products and that message is sinking we even dealt with that message at the United Nations we are dealing with it at the African Union we are dealing with it in sadak and we are going to make sure that yes it becomes a reality that there is beneficiation and our industrial policy supports this whole process of beneficiation so comrades we continue to ensure that the Africa Continental free trade area where we are going to be able to export many many Goods to the rest of our continent continues we want to make sure that we trade with our African sister countries and that is part of growing our economy and making sure that indeed we do get an economy that is growing the Third third priority of our Manifesto was to tackle the High Cost of Living we are beginning to see some relief for consumers with regard to the prices of basic Goods we have seen the reduction in the petrol price due in part to the strengthening of the Rand and the setting up of the government of national Unity also contributed to the strengthening of the Rand and that in leads to the decrease of a number of import prices particularly petrol and that is why we have also seen the reduction in the petrol price while there's been a decline in some food prices the competition commission has noted that there are some food prices that are still high and comrades will continue in a number of other areas to ensure that we introduce new ways of doing things for instance the school nutrition program which feeds over 9 million children we are grateful that the department of basic education is now going to add another meal breakfast as a meal to feed our children that too represents progress and the our government will continue with the SRD uh fund to make sure the SRD Grant and we expect that we will be advancing to another level of a grant and we are calling on government to make sure that we expedite this another progress area has been in improving the commuter rail lines iasa has not been working very hard to make sure that our commuter lines or raway lines and passengers are now beginning to go back to using rail the trains and we now see millions of our commuters going back to utilizing the trains that is the progress that was started in the sixth Administration and it continues those reforms are going ahead so comrades we also want to see an improvement in the quality of basic services that are given to our people basic services such as water Refuge collection and we are going to be making sure that our municipalities do give our people good basic Services what our counselors and our Mayors should focus on improving the services that they deliver to our people we are pleased that uren and in Johannesburg they have new ANC Mayors and we applaud them and we wish them the very best so that they can improve Services here in the last 100 days we signed the Bella Act the basic education law Amendment Mobil for now the new legislation is going to ensure that we improve our education system we also ensure that there is access to education right across the board without any form of discrimination without any form of preventing our children from entering into any of the schools in our country but it is also going to make sure that yes we focus on early childhood development they must start being educated from as early as 4 years old they must start going to schools and we are going to proceed with that and of course in executing the Bella act we have allowed a period a very brief period of three months to finalize two provisions and that is a process in which negotiations and we want the ANC to also get involved in those negotiations so that we can get an education system that can save all our children we also signed the nhi act nhi that is going to ensure that there is equal access to health has been signed into law and Y is our Implement y nhi we are just making sure sure that those who may well have had issues come forward but we want to make it clear that we are going to implement the National Health System at the same time we continue to engage with everyone several ministers in the gnu have been working with provinces and local government in the spirit of Cooperative governance to resolve a number of issues and we should applaud that at the same time we will continue to make efforts to ensure that thec deploy in all levels of government do their work whether they are ministers whether they are mec's whether they are premiers whether they are counselors they must continue doing their work we've also said that we must strengthen the monitoring and evaluation in thec house so comrades the gnu gives us a great opportunity and a great moment so that we can advance the interests of our people and we are also bringing about influence on all the other members of the gnu so that we continue to protect and Advance the r of the those who are vulnerable in society including children the elderly persons with disabilities and we are committed to upholding the rights of members of the lgbtq I A Plus Community now October is an important month to the lgbtqia A Plus Community they held their October M October Pride March and we congratulate Soto on the 20th anniversary of its Pride March and welcome The Pride March across the country to advance the rights of those communities that are vulnerable particularly against homophobia the emancipation of women comrades remains one of the cornerstones of our society that we wish to advance and to build and we celebrate achievements that are taking women to a higher level of leadership we celebrate also for instance the appointment and the inauguration of the country's first female Chief Justice in South Africa that is a moment that we should celebrate at the same time we must intensify our efforts to end it gender based violence and femicide a gbv comrades must not only be the task of thec women's league it must be our Collective task where we call upon men to respect the women of our country Hena so that we get rid of gender based violence in South Africa we must also in the end reduce and remove the gender pay Gap because we still find that in a number of places women are paid less than men and we say to companies get rid of that bad practice pay women who do exactly the same work as men exactly the same we must work together to reverse the recent dip in the representation of women in our Parliament also in a number of formations of government in Parliament now we seeing less a lesser number of women we need to attend to that we welcome the Vigor with which our minister of police and the criminal justice system as a whole are moving to tackle crime and Corruption and we welcome the cooperation that is taking place with communities with business with private security companies on effective crime prevention strategies we are making Headway across the criminal justice system in our fight against corruption yes against criminality we continue to implement yes the various recommendations of the of State capture commission and we will keep the pressure on we will leave no quarter unmoved we made a commitment comrades to build an accountable e ethical and professional public service we can see progress through the leadership of Institutions like the Public Service Commission the auditor general the public protector and the national school of government and as part of the sixth Administration or thec sixth priority Manifesto we are working to build a better Africa and a better world much of our International commit engagements over the past 100 days have been about expanding economic diplomacy wherever our ministers have gone from comrade lamula from comrade paow and others they have been going around the world campaigning for economic progress in our country and we've been making progress in opening up many other markets through bricks and through agoa and through various bilateral relations so our commitment to making sure that we have a multilateral world is unchallenged we will continue to do so and we welcome the decisions that have also have been taken by the United Nations to make sure that we reform the UN particularly its Security Council and we will continue comrades to advance the African agenda and we will continue to ensure that we support the people of Palestine in the next few days we will be submitting our full case to the international court of justice jce in support of the people of Palestine against the genocide that is being committed to the people of Palestine particularly in Gaza we also comrades May are concerned about the bombings that have been taking place by Israel in the nearby countries like Lebanon and we call on the World to put pressure on Israel to desist from all these attacks that they have been leveling against neighboring countries and we call for the immediate ceasefire that should take place yes in Gaza and the release of hostages and also making sure that humanitarian assistance does get through climate change continues to be a major problem and some some of our provinces here continue to experience it the government of national Unity has taken this task up climate change with a great deal of vigor and we are going to make sure that we do protect our people particularly those who continue to suffer from the disasters climate disasters that take place now comrades 100 days does not seem like a long time but it is a significant Milestone to gauge whether we are moving in the right direction or whether we are doing things differently and with more purpose our Reflections the reflections that we are making at this point in time that Although our challenges are huge there is collective commitment ment to working together to tackle these challenges and those who say we should not be working together with others need to come forward with Alternatives Alternatives that they believe can work and thus far we have not heard of any better option or alternative and that is why we will continue to work with the nine political parties as the African National Congress in the government of national Unity because the government of national Unity has brought about stability political stability in our country and it is giving a real meaningful promise for economic growth where investors are beginning to look at our country once again with greater interest both local and foreign investors because in the end comrades we need to work on improving our economy there is a firm commitment to advance towards building a better life for all our people the commitment to advance towards building a better life is also shared by many people who want to participate in the National dialogue the idea of a national dialogue has now been broadly accepted the national dialogue will be an important moment where we will get our people to participate through their various formations be it political parties religious organizations traditional organization sporting organizations cultural organizations educational organizations you name them we will want them to participate in discussing the state of our nation and also in charting a way forward for South Africa so we are looking forward to the holding of the national dialogue so that we can take South Africa forward we should always commat remind ourselves of the words of the great African freedom fighter amila cabal who would have turned 100 years uh if he had continue to live when he said we must always remember that the people are not fighting of struggling for ideas the ideas that are in your head the people fight and accept the sacrifices demanded in order to gain material advantages to live better to live in peace to benefit from progress and for the better future of their children so our people are not trying to fight for what is in the head of leaders they want real progress they want jobs they want to lead a better life they want poverty to be obliterated in South Africa they want inequality to come to an end but they want real things now comrades our country has entered a new era and it is an important era yes it's an era full of challenges it is an era that is also full of risks but it is also an era that is full of possibilities as thec we are determined to seize these opportunities to advance the needs and the interests of the people of South Africa we we are determined to advance the fundamental social and economic transformation of our society as we Mark a 100 days of the government of national Unity we once again call on all South Africans to join us to do more together City wasan come and work with us and we are grateful that nine parties responded positively to the invitation that we issued to come and join us to form a government of national Unity to stabilize our country to take our country forward we say let us work together this is a moment for all South Africans to work together to advance the interest of South Africa African National Congress long live the African National Congress long live long long live the gnu long livees again MO

MehdnnntDoA,Day 5 | Judicial Service Commission Interviews: 14 October 2024,2024-10-14T17:47:21Z,37546,"and LLB from the University of the Western Cape that's correct and uh a while later did um and L with with the University of Cape Town that's correct chief justice what was your thesis on this this the the topic of my thesis was restorative justice in the context of Juvenile Justice all right you did not stop there you obtained a certificate in labor law from UC and a diploma in insolvency law and practice from the University of Petoria that's correct I'm sure those uh qualifications came in handy in in your practice indeed chief justice you joined the the site but you did your articles um between 1988 and 1990 then became a professional assistant in another Law Firm that's correct for nine months mhm and uh that nine months was enough to build up the courage to start your own practice well chief justice I was effectively running that practice and that motivated me to start my own practice yes and you ran a solo outfit for for 14 years that's correct chief justice post articles I have uh practiced as an attorney for 15 years 14 years I was the sole propriety of my own firm all right doing what kind of work well initially uh being a woman at that time uh the opportunities for commercial work etc was quite limited so I initially started out doing criminal work and I sort of called myself a GP a general practitioner that would include Administration uh of Estates um doing uh criminal work which was the larger part uh of my work and then the run of the M uh legal work such as uh interdicts uh spoliation or orders eviction matters everything but complex commercial matters and I took whatever came on my table yeah as as we all did yes uh you were permanently appointed in this division you seek to lead now in 2006 already that's correct chief justice but he had acted as a judge before I've acted uh as a judge that's correct first in the northern Cape uh two terms in the northern cape and one term in the Eastern Cape currently two months from now uh my period of service as a judge would be 19 years in which uh seat of the Eastern Cape division did you work I worked in Port Elizabeth as well as grown uh which was the seat of all of the appeal court in Grown right I did not know that until I read your papers okay um and you have acted at the Apex Court I have acted for for one full year in the Constitutional Court that's correct M how did you find that experience it was quite an experience because I was exposed to handson experience of the transformation agenda of our Constitution and um it made me more alive to the situation in South Africa human rights socioeconomic uh conditions and the Mandate of the Constitution and its transformative agenda so it was a very very enlightening and educational experience for me yes but then you you refused my invitation to act at the Supreme Court of Appeal at that time it wasn't a a suitable time for me uh for due to personal reasons ch no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just I'm just I never forgive you for that there's still opportunity for me in the future chief justice indeed you still have a lot of time on the bench 10 10 is it 10 years that's correct Chief all right um you you've done a lot of things you've managed to find time to to to write articles that that were published um in the midst of of of of your business job and and and and family life and everything else that's correct chief justice I was quite busy in my younger days I was quite energetic uh you will note that I sat for the notary exams I sat for the conveyancing exams oh yes you you were admitted as con and not rep public as well yeah I was quite energetic at the time Chief jce but then you were writing as as as recently as as 2016 you you'd been a judge for 10 years then but but then you stopped I I stopped because I had to focus more on my judgment writing yeah and speak through my judgments but I'd like to resume writing because there are many things that one can write about yeah well you you've written many many many judgments in the 19 years on the bench I'm not even going to to go there on all aspects of of of the law um um you you've been very active You' You' you've been involved with a number of organization but notably the South African chapter of the International Association of women judges of for you were an executive member for for two terms that's correct chief justice I started out at Nadal my principal was Essa Musa who was one of the founder members of Nadal when I started my articles there uh I immediately became involved in adal that is the organization I've been attached to I think the longest and then uh 5 years before my appointment I was with bla and then of course as a judge I became active in the International Association of woman judges where I served as treasurer for two terms that translates into four years okay you've been in a leadership position in in that court for for a number of years when when when were you appointed as uh uh Deputy judge president the 1st of June 2016 chief justice I'm currently Deputy judge president of the division for eight years and I've been acting uh as acting judge president two months short of two years so it's 10 years almost 10 years in total okay it's public knowledge that that court is notorious for being uh troubled uh for for for use of a simple term and um in fact one of of of your contenders has mentioned that uh moral is low and uh he says one of the things he would like to achieve if he is appointed is to create an environment where judges can work speak and just go about their way without feeling intimidated dated that that's and and then there is um a statement uh that raises a number of concerns uh that was submitted to the Judicial Service Commission by one of the senior judges there judge Ali who who list a number a number of uh things uh that she says are concerning about your leadership style and the measures you have implemented which she perceives as as ruiners to the running of of of the Court how are things there really and um just how are things there and what what do you have in mind to to put them right if these accounts are true uh chief justice two short of two months I have been leading that division for almost two years when I stepped into that position of acting judge president the division was in a dire State there were no judges meetings held for a period of six years the t- room was non-existent the morale of the judges were low so yes it was very challenging for me initially when I took over this Division I immediately introduced mechanisms to make the environment more conducive for judges to operate in and chief justice I can categorically say that if there is a judge who says that the division is troubled as I sit here today that is not a correct statement to make I've introduced judges meetings upon my appointment judges are free to Air their views judges are free to place matters on the agenda this was mentioned in judge Ali's uh comments that she's made but I will get there later the division is not a division where no one is talking to each other where no one is performing where people are where there's mistrust and uh unstable environment I think if there's anyone who says that the Western Cape division is in disarray it is an incorrect statement to make I have worked very hard and I have put mechanisms in place to make the environment conducive for for Service delivery and I believe that I did that to the best of my ability there has never been any bad publicity about the Western Cape high court in the almost two years that I have been leading that division so if a judge says that that judge feels uncomfortable in that Division and that division is not running properly and that that judge does not have a voice it is an incorrect statement my Chambers is open I have an open door policy and chief justice and honorable Commissioners let me inform you as follows not a single judge came to my Chambers to come and complain about anything and for any judge to now at this stage make submissions to the to to this August body that that the division has problems I am very surprised to hear that I have an open door policy anyone can come and see me at 9:30 in the morning without an appointment but let me go back to when I took over this Division I immediately called the judges meeting I informed the judges we are all alive to the history in this Division and I am now assuming assuming the seat and we must now go on a project of healing in the division and I allowed all the judges to articulate how they feel what they think we should do to improve the running of the division What mechanisms we can put in place and we had a very productive meeting my words at the start of that meeting was let's have a conversation so chief justice I dispute any statement that's trying to create the perception that that division is not functioning efficiently effectively if there is a judge who may have an issue it was not raised with me we have regular judges meetings I reinstalled the T specifically to further and to encourage collegiality in the division the t- room was non-existent when I took over the division the t- room is flourishing have regular regular judges meeting we are communicating with each other judges are free to Air their views make suggestions Etc with regard to judge Ali I have responded to those submissions and I am quite happy to respond to each and every aspect that any commissioner feels I should respond to all I can say is Judge Ali is not in leadership she is not aware as to how my office functions and the processes that is is in place and if there's any specific aspect that any commissioner would like to clarify with me I am most welcome to do that but let me take one one aspect that she's raised in her uh submissions that she has made she talks about expedited dates implying that I am creating a system of preferential treatment in certain matters and alluded to the fact that I can be swayed to expedite matters and then thereafter she states that my strategy the manner in which I allocate expedited dates impacts on judges who are attending to semi- Urgent and Urgent matters in the sense that if the a judge decides a matter is urgent or semi-urgent and I can interfere by providing expedite to dates I would imagine bringing those dates forward or interfering with urgent and semi-urgent dates honorable Commissioners that statement is entirely untrue an expedited date has got nothing to do with urgent dates or semi-urgent dates but when one reads those comments it can create the impression why would the ajp give people expedited dates alongside the concept of semi-urgent and Urgent matters but there's no connection between the two honorable Commissioners and expedited date is exactly what it is there's already a a trial date allocated to those to to those matters so as as an example uh hearing date could be scheduled for the 10th of February 2025 and the parties and that is all the parties in the matter may approach the office of the judge president to expedite that particular date it has got nothing to do with urgent matters people can apply for Urgent matter urgent dates in the normal course the UR judge on urgent duty deals with those issues semi- urgent dates they can go to the fourth division Clark for a semi-urgent date but expedited dates which Falls within the prerogative of the judge president is done as follows all applications for expedite the dates must be in writing and it must be at the request of both parties as I've alluded to earlier the date may have have been scheduled for February 2025 and what the parties then do is they jointly approach the acting judge president to bring the date forward and that is on that basis that the matter can then be expedited if there are legitimate grounds for that I have been doing it as the acting judge president for many years and there's no magic to it there's no fixed criteria obviously but it can be for many reasons and both parties must seek and apply for the expeditor date so it is done in the writing it is a paper process I don't see anyone and it is assessed on its merits on paper it can be any reason for example one of the parties will be immigrating it involves a child or someone is very ill and frail or very elderly there are many scenarios that's why there's not a fixed list as to when you allow expedited dates so uh Chief Justice Just on that score and if alluded to concerns by judge Ali I just needed to clarify the fact that expedited dates semi- urgent dates and Urgent dates are entirely separate issues all right well she she does raise other concerns ranging from an allegation that uh whilst there are Judges meetings uh no minutes are taken there so uh it's it's difficult to keep up with what resolutions were taken uh to the more serious that uh the system of the Contin continuous role which we we who who the importance of which we we know too well has been prejudiced by the the manner in which the what the measures you have um put in place uh causing delays uh in in in in in in work output and uh then there is another concern another serious concern um the general impression in fact that one gets from this uh from this uh submission that the judge is there um do not have a voice really you impose your your your your views and and decisions upon them you don't consult that's what comes out of of of this chief justice the last statement I'm the one who introduced judges meetings judges are free to place any items on the agenda and that is how we've been running I have an open door policy I'm most certainly not the dictator I can reassure this commission any judge can come and raise any issue with me I did not actually get the impression that she was saying that judges don't have a voice in her comments the fact of the matter is I reestablished regular judges meetings I reestablished the T to promote collegiality and any allegation that no that judges don't have a voice I must refute those allegations it is most certainly not true with regard to minutes of meetings chief justice since 2010 no minutes have been taken at that meeting so I've made submissions on that regard I was the last scribe of Judges meetings a resolution was taken in 2010 that no minutes will be taken any longer judges should be free to express themselves I have made written submissions on that point that I requested the judge president to stand down because I was the official scribe and uh judge was designated a a female judge and then a debate ensued as to why only female judges should take minutes uh the debate ensued and judge Ali was very vocal about it and ultimately a decision was taken not to take any minutes in judge's meetings that was 2010 so since 2010 no minutes were taken but when I assumed my position as ajp I took it upon myself to record uh the my notes I wouldn't call it minutes it's my notes because ultimately as a leader you must make notes as to the way forward and which which matter should be actioned etc etc this statement that there are no record of of minutes and and Recorders of of of decisions taken that is entirely untrue I was the Scribe last in 2010 and I'm still the Scribe chief justice I'm still the Scribe because as the leader you must know you must action things some matters are referred to the practice committee by the way I also established the Committees that there was no committees when I took over uh the division on the 14th of December 2020 so I reestablished the t- room I restored the meetings and um I I then also reestablished uh certain committees the it committee building committee uh Library committee etc etc so Commissioners picture this you you have the freedom to air your views to place a matter on the agenda you have the freedom to air your views um and say what you want to say and make proposals in our very first meeting the proposal came out we only have 40 matters on the motion Court role let's increase it to 100 matters that was at our very first meeting who says judge how can judges say they don't have a voice and we implemented that and if there were any other issues we would decide how to action it it would go be referred to the building committee it would be referred to the library committee or it would be referred to the practice Committee in terms of how we action matters and or it would be something that management will raise with a chief regist or with a director of Court operations chief justice I can reassure this commit commission there are indeed a record of each and every um meeting that takes place there it may not be visible to others I was the law scribe and I am still in my capacity as ajp still keeping minutes in that meeting then with regard to a continuous role The Continuous role is very much alive in the division but chief justice we all know what happened to that continuous role during the co era when I took over as the acting judge president on the 14th of December 22 more than 80% of the judges were involved in crime only 20% of the judges were available for civil Al allocations 80% of the judges were part of the criminal backlog project now what do you do as a leader when 80% of the judges are all busy with crime what happens to the Civil role what happens to the continuous role how do you navigate your way around that 80% of the judges in crime and the 20% who were seized with civil matters were bearing the brunt of civil matters and they were all overloaded with civil matters they hardly had any space in their Diaries 20% of the judges had to carry that load and Western Cape high court has a heavy civil load so with 80% of the judges in crime 20% of Judges busy with civil chief justice the reality is there cannot be a continuous role the criminal backlog project obliterated the the idea of a continuous role and I had to navigate my way around that so if anyone tells this commission writes to this commission and says that the ajp interfered with the functioning of a continuous role it means that they don't have an understanding of the state of the division I did an audit of the state of the division when I assumed the position of ajp and with 80% of the judges in crime it was very difficult to maintain a continuous role with only 20% of the judges in crime uh in civil the idea is to allocate a matter and let one judge take the matter to its to its uh completion that that is the idea but honorable Commissioners when I say 80% of the judges were in crime you must understand that th those 80% of the judges did not only deal with one criminal matter they had more than one criminal matter each and when I took over that division the number of partur criminal matters that had to be completed in peace Mill fashion for various reasons if one judge was uh in the criminal backlog pool had three parted matters to attend to they then had to align their diaries with defense council with a state attorney uh with and and align the diaries with the result that those parts were completed in a peace meal fashion which further obliterates the idea of a continuous role the idea of the continuous role is an ideal in a normal situation where the court is functioning normally and when where there are no backlogs and where you don't sit in a situation where 80% of the judges are seized with crime and you have a small number of judges who can then proceed with civil matters so chief justice this idea that I ran this division not according to a continuous role uh there's no merit in that one must be alive to the realities of the situation following the co9 pandemic and our division is currently still dealing with the aftermath of that in terms of the finalize finalizing of our criminal matters the Western cap High Court cannot at this stage have a fully functional continuous role until we have achieved a certain level of completion with criminal matters which we have now done uh in this last term all right going taken uh ajp but just to go back to the first part of my question about my impression that you don't consult your colleagues there uh this submission pertinently states that uh um you fail to circulate timeously to your colleagues reports discussion documents and resolutions requiring their input and uh it lists and a number of examples um and mentions something quite worrisome that you do not ask the judges for their inputs uh at uh has of Court meetings and they are not given feedback on decisions taken at that Forum chief justice I have responded to that allegation judge Ali mentioned a specific meeting and what had happened at that meeting that meeting was specifically called to give feedback on what happened at the heads of Court meeting I actually call special meetings for the judges to attend and not all the judges attend all the time I don't think judge Ali attended all the meetings but I specifically call judges meetings and then I call separate meetings to give feedback on what other issues are of concern I have responded to that complaint chief justice there was an allegation that I didn't circulate the first rationalization report I've responded to that that allegation that was under the leadership of Judge Traverso and judge lope that allegation is not true there was an allegation that I did not uh circulate the second rationalization report I've provided proof of that it was circul circulated to all the judges there was an allegation that I did not circulate resolutions at the judges conference to the judges I have circulated those resolutions and I have provided proof of that chief justice I think this allegation of me not communicating with judges and not circulating documents I I I I reject that allegation with with the contempt it deserves because one of my strengths is communication and I am an inclusive leader I'm a collaborative leader there is absolutely no way that I would not circulate documents to judges and for judge Ali to make the statement after our judges conference that I did not circulate the resolutions I provided the commission with proof that I've circulated it that in itself it's an incorrect statement and I would like to ask the commission to view that statement with caution because the exact items she mentioned that I did not circulate I I provided the commission with proof thereof and I do discuss important aspects as to what happens in the heads of Court meetings regarding issues that affect the judges whether it's the benefits motor vehicle benefits cell phone benefits and issues with regarding uh recesses leave periods etc etc I do and I had those type of meetings and and and honorable Commissioners those meetings where I discuss matters uh that would be addressed at heads of court I involve the admin management also in those meetings they also sit at uh in those meetings because budgetary issues comes up tools of trade is discussed benefits judges benefits are discussed and it's important for the management and I'm saying management I'm talking about the management who would be responsible for uh the budget of the court it's important that they are there or if there's a shortage of Staff which was also an item that we have discussed at heads of Court meeting I I I rais the all those issues uh in the meetings that I call special meetings the special meetings would be some things that's not just within the division but things that impacts on the judges so chief justice that statement that I don't consult is incorrect the statement that I don't circulate is incorrect and the statement that I don't report on what happens at heads of Court meetings are incorrect and judge Ali in her own complaint referred to a meeting which was specifically called to report on what had transpired in a heads of Court meeting thank you ajp now you you've mentioned uh a number of measures you say you have put in place uh since you took over uh that have worked to get the division back on its Feit uh helped it recover from from the bad condition in which you found it when you took over as acting judge president is there still any room for improvement in the operations of the court and if you think there is what ideas do you have uh chief justice and honorable Commissioners I not here today to only talk about what I can do for the division I am here to talk about what I have already done I have a track record I almost ran that division for two years I have a track record chief justice when I took over that division the director of public prosecutions were not allowed in the building for some reason the director of Court operations were not allowed to enter into that building and when I assumed office that is the first two people who came to see me the national director of public prosecutions informed me she's not allowed to enter the building she must work through the chief registra if there's anything she wants to discuss regarding crime she must speak through the chief regist and that hampered Service delivery because there were no meeting between herself and the leadership to discuss the criminal backlog I am aware that a a judge a senior judge was designated to be in charge of the criminal backlog but that judge also did not Li his St directly with the NPA so I am mentioning this because this is one of the bad things that I found when I when I started uh when I took over the division as ajp the Director of Court operations were only allowed to attend certain meetings so they were the two first people who came to me and I immediately restored their access to the division and I uh later on that we we we we communicated with each other and the NPA is obviously part of the stakeholders that I regularly consult so that was also one of the first things I did was Consulting all stakeholders be it the family Advocate NPA the legal profession LPC Etc I have given an indication of what I have done but the most important thing to remember is that there was no hand over in that division so I assumed the leadership of the division without any Handover and I was on my own and I ran that division on my own for one full term I did a wellness check and I discovered 324 files that needed to be actioned with correspondence as far back as August 201 22 and I had to action those matters expeditiously I did a wellness check and decided to run the division on my own the first term and I utilized that strategy because in my capacity as Deputy judge president I had the necessity KN how to know how the division should run optimally but the point that I'm making is the division was not in perfect shape at the time no t- room no stakeholder engagement people were banned from the building no regular meetings and I had to restore and work with all those those aspect when I assumed um the position as ajp the lead time of cases were um that was in in in in uh the 14th of December 2022 the clo the the closest date that you could get a civil matter on the role uh was two two and a half years from from that date two and a half years from that date I I arrested that date with mechanisms that I've put in place so Chief just I've mentioned some of the the the the things that I have done um so I've spoken about the restoration of the Committees I've spoken about our meetings um I've involved judges in the running of the division and some of the judges who are going to present themselves here today they are members of committees judge tari is dealing with the building and management as well as judge manami judge Ling is involed in HR and the practice committee judge Ali herself said that she was involved in training uh acting judges there's not a single judge who was left out and if judges don't have a voice chief justice I wonder why they would get involved and and sit on these committees that is not true they were actively participating in structures that I initiated and put in place so chief justice your question is what did I do can I just get clarification because I can I can itemize what I did do or is it what new I would like to do I was asking if you still think there is room for improvement on the operations of the court and if there is what what are those what ideas do you have to to to to to get the court in better shape chief justice currently the Western Cape division is drowning in paper in my view the court is functioning quite in a stable manner the court is fully functional uh you can never say court is functioning optimally because there's always room for improvement but the Western Cape division is drowning in paper so what is needed desperately now and the most efficient ways to improve the Western Cape division currently is through digitization so with regard to digitization all the staff have been trained the judges have been trained we are currently busy embarking on reaching out to other stakeholders Grassroots community members and every any any person that you could think of LPC The Bar Council the profession the man in the street we are busy embarking on consultation with stakeholders to provide training to them so the entire court is trained stakeholders will be trained we are currently in the process of finalizing our practice directives and then we will embark on the regist registration of all the parties and stakeholders and we hope to go live on one December this year that is the most pressing need for the Western Cape High Court is to digitize the court and that is work in progress at the moment chief justice with regard to the case flow as such I have introduced mechanisms to increase productivity I've indicated that um when I assumed my position I observed that the Friday appeal role was there were very few cases on the Friday appeal sometimes just three or four cases there are 33 judges uh that would mean that you would have three judges in motion court that would leave City Judges who have who needs to be allocated on a Friday and if there are only three cases that would then keep six judges busy and I immediately introduced a system where opposed motions are also Now Heard on a Friday to make the court more productive I've also introduced a pro pro bono project many years ago there was a pro bono project but I introduced the pro bono project not only limited to Fridays but to any day whenever pro bono council is available and that is to be understood against the background that 80% of the judges were involved in crime so I needed the necessary assistance specifically in the Civil pool and I made use of the pro bono uh resource so what happened then was that the number of opposed motions the finalization right in terms of our stats increased dramatically because you had judges hearing opposed motions on a Friday which could be 20 judges as I've just indicated and you have Pro boner judges hearing a poos motion so the biggest impact in terms of stats during my um stint as the ajp is in the number of uh of opposed motions that virtually trebled compared to previous years I also established the ra court that deals specifically with ra matters and the purpose of that Court was to try and mediate some of the disputes try to minimize the issues um and try to facilitate early settlement of R matters and that specific Court dealt with prasa and ref matters as well and then of course there's the issue of uh damages a medical negligence um matters that could also be mediated in that court and I myself I was involved I am involved in U mediating Family Matters and uh medical negligence matters in order to see whether those matters can be settled out of court so the RAF Court also had big impact because uh many of the matters uh became settled and that resulted in vacant slot for other matters and then what the project that Ian introduced was where R matters were allocated in a specific slot we then approach the profession and where matters are postponed a year or so later we give them an opportunity to fill those slots in other words we brought matters forward and that arrested the lead time of matters in the divis from where I sit here now if a civil matter if you require a civil trial date we are looking at the 12th of August 2025 if you are looking for a semi- urgent date we're looking at January 2025 an urgent date is even sooner so our lead times currently is excellent uh for civil trials it it currently is 8 months but the goal is to get our lead times in six months so the rest project uh increased productivity allowed us to bring matters forward and to increase our stats the Friday project plus the pro bono project also increased productivity in the division and increased our stats in so far's opposed motions uh are concerned um with regard to Crime the division currently have 33 parted criminal matters last term last term 16 criminal matters uh were finalized and we currently have 33 parted matters of which 14 of the matters are in sentencing stage so if you take the 16 matters last term that was finalized plus the 14 matters that is in sentencing stage we you're looking at 30 matters with by this term 30 matters would have been concluded uh so there is an improvement in the finalization rate of criminal matters uh chief justice I did mention uh in my papers that I have introduced the rafh directives I have also introduced the criminal directives and through implementation of those directives the court became more productive and I streamlined processes uh with the ra court and with the control of the criminal courts uh the criminal um directives that also improve the efficacy of the Court thank you chief justice thank you ajp so in some alls well as can be in the Western Cape division of the high court and it only faces the challenges uh that the rest of our courts have yes Chief J Justice I want to reassure the commission I am the deputy judge president of that division I've been trained I have been fully trained by the former judge president the former judge president was my mentor and for me to step into the position of ajp it cannot be corrected if any judge wants to create the impression that I don't know what I'm doing and I don't know what's going on and judges don't have a voice quite frankly that is not my personality so chief justice to answer your question it is correct the Western Cape division has normal normal challenges lack of resources shortage of Staff in need of building maintenance sometimes the airon doesn't work in need of more judges and in need of more courts and on my on Assumption of my position as a ajp and as I've indicated to the commission I have institutional memory and as the saying goes you must know where you come from to know where you're heading to so I am very alive and I've always been very alive to the fact that we need additional Courts at the Western cap high court and when I assumed my position position as ajp I immediately put mechanisms in place to achieve that goal for extra for additional courts uh for the Western Cape high court so I've put mechanisms in place and uh motivated for the additional courts and uh on the 24th of August this year uh th the that uh my request was approved so it is a short-term project short or medium-term 2 to threeyear project uh the uh Public Works approved the addition of three new Courts for the Western cap High Court plus a record room chief justice my answer to your question is yes there's nothing unique in the challenges that the Western cap High Court face the court is functioning judges are talking meetings are held judges can a their views freely and the challenges facing the Western court is nothing more than challenges that would face any court and that would be lack of resources lack of space to few judges and then the question of Digit Digi digitization of the Court thank you chief justice thank you ajp uh judge gamble do you have questions for this candidate yes thank you CJ ajp just a couple of nuts and belts issues before I ask you a few more probing questions your CV shows us that you turn 60 tomorrow that's correct chief justice so how much time do you have left to to offer the division effectively 10 years but you could go earlier if if if you wanted to I have 10 years but I could leave on 65 if I want to yes uh so the provision that you leave at 65 would mean that you could offer a minimum minimum of five and a maximum of 10 that's correct commissioner the I'm looking at the list of of uh of acting judges at the moment and I see that at present the division has 14 acting judges in in position that's correct uh there actually more than more than 14 judges some of them share share return but there are 14 slots for acting judges that's correct you've also lost um a number of experienced judges over the last couple of years and and another one to go shortly that is correct uh commissioner um one two 3 four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 and with one retiring short to be 12 the division lost uh in the last what three four years 12 judges to retirement um there are currently four vacancies yes the the the the pool of the skills pool and the experience pool of the judges uh is depleted at the moment was he depleting now I'm looking at the list the current list of of acting judges you probably have it there before you uh you've sourced acting judges from all over would you perhaps like to speak to that I see that you've even saw judges acting judges from from Ken and I think lopa um yeah would you like to speak to that yeah I just uh can't find my list I'm just checking if I can lay my on it um I can give you the list you can you can give me that list but what I can say is um I Source acting judges from the profession from stakeholders and names are put forward and then in consultation with the deputy we who then uh invite uh acting judges the idea is to make the pool as diverse as possible and what we have experienced was that we were struggling to find black capable black acting judges to act in the division so resultantly what I did I went to I went wider than the Western Cape high court in order to make sure that the appointments uh are diverse and yes I I have approached I think three African women outside of the province uh to come and act in the division now there's an issue that that the Chief Justice raised about division and disharmony in the division I think you need to place that in context I don't think you've given the commission the proper context in in relation to which that division arose because it's something that many of us have have lived through you were appointed in 2016 uh at that stage the applications the applicants for Deputy judge president were yourself judge Ali and judge lanji that's good chief justice the judge president at that stage the former judge president at that stage um was happy to have you and and pushed for your appointment as I understand it I was appointed as the deputy chief justice in 2016 and judge Ali was also a contender for the position what was the relationship between yourself and the chief and and the former judge president at the time of your appointment in 2016 your working relationship the former judge president and myself had an excellent relationship working relationship in fact we had different leadership styles he mentored me he trained me and I provided the necessary support to the uh former judge president um I I can safely say that there were no issues between us and we complemented each other and the division was well run at the time according to your CV in 2018 you spent the year at the Constitutional Court the full year that's Cur chief justice and while we while you were away was there an acting Deputy judge presid appointed in your place that is correct it was judged to sign when you came back from the Constitutional Court you reassumed your position as uh djp that's correct and then at the beginning of 2020 it was I think it was January 2020 you took the extraordinary step of laying a complaint against your judge president and that received a lot of publicity at the time and a lot of people were critical about what was going on in the western C I think you need to explain to the Commissioners what the context of that that complaint was Judge Campbell no we're not going to go there uh some of these matters are still subject to uh to adjudication by the judicial conduct committee and and perhaps uh a Judicial conduct tribunal and uh quite apart from that I don't think it would be right to to to to ask the candidate about things which concern someone else who's not before us to answer for themselves so please just assist from that line of questioning very well very well um after after that complaint was lodged what was the relationship between yourself and the and and the former judge president CL obviously impacted on our relationship uh chief justice uh I uh I I I heard your um directive that it is not necessary to go too much into detail uh surrounding what had transpired then uh all I can tell the commission is that I was a complainant and I lodged a complaint and subsequent to my complaint a counter complaint against me was lodged the matter was went through the necessary processes and ultimately a decision was made by this body as to what should happen to that complaint uh which in terms of which I was exonerated I'm referring to the counter complaint but uh if I could answer judge Gamble's question yes the division there were tensions uh at the time after I launch the complaint and uh I can would like to indicate to the commissioners and I informed the judges the same the dispute was between myself and the judge president it didn't involve any other judges there it it was up to that judge if that judge would perhaps want to choose sides Etc I'm not aware who chose sides what and who did what I regarded it as a personal matter and as a matter between myself and the judge president therefore if there's any anyone who wants to to acting judge president I already gave a directive that we shall not discuss what may or me what have happened between you and former judge president please let's not go there thank you chief justice thank you chief justice I would just like to make the point that it was just an issue between two people thank you chief justice thank you and then lastly when sorry may continue yes please we're waiting for you last when when you took over what was the relationship between the office of the the judge president and and the cap bar as far as acting appointment is concerned and what was the relationship between that office and the bar in general um chief justice I I sorry during which period speak did just repeat the question I didn't catch it I'm I'm asking what the when judge Goliath over as the ajp MH what the relationship between that office and the bar was relationship between the court and the bar yes uh chief justice Commissioners when I assumed office I reached out to all the stakeholders it was very clear to me that there was no communication between the office of the judge president and many of the stakeholders that I had reached out to the B was but one of the stakeholders that I reached out that is ground we traversed when I led you acting judge president you did tell us about what you've done about stakeholder engagement and and training and and all of that so yes for the sake of time if anything let's just uh yeah yes um uh chief justice I had a meeting with the bar um I I will leave it at that I I I think I'm not going to comment on on on on the nature of the relationship safe to say that I have reestablished a relationship between the bar and bench and then just lastly on that score there's a pro bono scheme in place which with with the bar would you like to explain to the commission how that works uh chief justice because of the problem with the criminal backlog and the fact that 80% of the judges were stuck in crime and I only had 20% judges in the Civil pool the need arose to obtain outside assistance and uh after I reestablished ties with the bar I approached the the bar to at our meeting at our St stakeholder engagement meeting proposals were put on the table for the bar to assist actually it was an old project many years ago with a bar did assist on Fridays I just expanded it I re reinvigorated the project after many years and currently there are about 30 uh Advocates uh at the bar who make themselves available on a pro bono basis uh I have reestablish that project the project is very very productive very fruitful and it is increasing as I have indicated our productivity and our stats more specifically with regard to in opposed motion and as I understand it that system enjoys the sanction of the minister and what happens is at the beginning of any particular term a number of pro boner um Council are sworn in as as judges for the term and then when the need arises if it necessary at short notice you can call upon them toh to come in and assist to alleviate the the Civil role that is correct uh chief justice that is the sole purpose of the problem Bono pool uh they we engage with them and they would notify my office of their availability any date that they are available they would notify my office and uh we would then make use of these services and yes their main role is to assist with it's assist in the Civil pool thank you chief justice thank you Jud gell Mr bosov do you have questions uh yes thank you chief justice uh morning ajp morning uh chief justice I'm aware we are running quite behind schedules but um yeah we still have six other people to but with your gra if I I'm used to having my two questions but I'll try and make them quick all right um ajp so just firstly on on um leadership issues um you're applying for position which is the key leadership role in in this division now big part of management is people management um now we you've at length addressed the complaints by by judge Ali or the objections rather is a better phrasing um but what I find confusing is in your in your written response you um make mention of the reason why minutes were no longer kept and um the objection was that it might be seen as stifling you know Etc and therefore there was a resolution not to keep minutes but you've not told this commission that in fact you do keep minutes but your words were they might not be visible to others now that to me creates the impression because the purpose of minutes is to have a record which is then circulated afterwards and everybody agrees yes that is indeed what was said and that is what was decided and as management we move forward from that base so what purpose does it then serve to keep these minutes on your own and to me at least it creates the impression that it has the potential of weaponizing these minutes for a rainy day one day and I'm concerned that that displays a a a misunderstanding of the the Nuance of why minutes are actually an empowering tool rather than a tool that could be used to to create more mistrust which is the last thing this division would require um and then and then just on that note again in the line of of people management this complaint that you speak to your fellow judges through your regist and that the registar is perceived as um you know almost kind of being you know conveyor of your instructions to your fellow judges and and then please I'm not detracting from from from your registrar's experience and importance that's not the point just being in management myself I I I think and also having a superior I would not take kindly if if secretaries were carrying instructions to me or me to my you know to my team it creates the impression of I don't have time to talk to you but um you know so I would just like to hear your comment on that that's my first kind of general question with regard to the minutes of the meetings in 2010 a resolution was taken that no minutes should be taken at the meetings I was the last scribe I took the last minutes and in case it didn't come out clear what I indicated was that I make a record of issues that are discussed for purposes of an action plan that is the reason why I make that notes as a leader it's not meant for circulation it is meant for Action if any proposal is made if any recommendation is made I must make a note of it to ensure that it is followed through but chief justice and Commissioners the resolution was taken in 2010 that judges want to engage freely and openly and to use your words no minutes can be weaponized against anyone it was a resolution that was taken I was the last scribe I have institutional memory about that decision the judges need to take a new resolution that we will in fact take minutes but having said that as a leader you must note note down action points if something must be referred to the library committee I will make a note the PE the judges who sit on the library committee will action it if something must be followed up with a chief regist for example where we resolved I would make a note we resolved that from now onwards instead of 40 matters on the motion Court role we are increasing it to 100 those are the type of notes that I record so that I can know exactly what the issues were that was raised and what action was taken and then there's a second chapter to this chief justice and Commissioners the meeting will reconvene and we will do our report backs and we will discuss if a matter was not properly resolved so the fact that there's not formal minutes taken flows from a resolution that was taken 2010 because judges want to be free to Air their views and a statement that absolutely no minute is taken by myself as the current acting leader in that division it's it's not correct because as the last scribe I know the importance of recording certain decisions so although I may not have returned as a full-time scribe where minutes are taken and uh circulated or perhaps I should pause there chief justice since I have institutional memory the minutes that I took in those meetings were just for recordal purposes the minutes were never typed out while I was described and while I the recorded minutes it was never typed and circulated that didn't happen it was only there for record purposes if we need to go back and see what happened on a specific day or whether something was raised by someone we would consult it but it wasn't typed it wasn't approved no one could change it it was just for purposes of recordkeeping and that stopped after a resolution was taken so I'd like to reassure uh this uh commission and commissioner bosov that uh the the the the the meeting and the Salient issues are most certainly recorded in the meeting and it is followed up it's actioned and it is followed up and it is raised again if it is hasn't been executed thank you um AGP then look I just want to preface this the following question with two statements the first is that um nobody expects judges to be perfect everybody's human so it's certainly not uncommon for judges to have their decisions taken on appeal and um appeals upheld Etc um and then secondly I want to just assure you I certainly don't take pleasure in in in in in the necessity of this question but it's recently be it's come to my attention that two judgments of the sca which have dealt with your judgments um as Court of first instance um the most recent one is Standard Bank the pigon construction um and I suppose the first sentence of the sca judgment really sets the tone in which judge gin wrote If the errors and their consequences were not so serious this appeal could be said to arise from a comedy of errors and in which the sea then explained that there were liquidation and sequestration applications before you and there was an a counter application for to join as an intervening party and apply for business rescue but then there was a settlement agreement which culminated in a consent order withdrawing the application for to intervene and business rescue and to place you know to and then issue provisional orders of liquidation and sequestration uh the discharge of which would be made contingent upon the sale of a property and payment of monies Etc that then fell through and the parties returned to court seeking and this now Standard Bank seeking final liquidation orders and sequestration orders however according to the sca you then ignored the consent order didn't deal with it at all granted the application for business rescue and discharge the provisional orders and the sea in particular stated that you in essence dealt with a non-existent application and given the consent order which you issued had no jurisdiction to hear the the the the issues of liquidation and sequestration any further and the sea I just want to quote their words sorry just uh in paragraph 28 I think is I don't want to belabor the process with further quotation but the court said courts are not entitled to Simply wish away previous orders or to ignore them totally when they bear on a matter at hand in addition where there is no application to set aside the order or the agreement it is not acceptable to deal with either in in the kind of offhand manner as was done in the Judgment refusing leave to appeal because you also subsequently refuse leave to appeal the entire approach taken to the matter by the high court must regrettably be at in the strongest possible terms then in an earlier 2014 matter pangara V bua Thea also stated that in which you then sat with an acting judge uh in a in a two judge um bench that the failure of the high court to appreciate or consider the appropriate principles it resulted in a grave Injustice to the magistrate that heard the matter initially and it may well have repara harmed that Magistrate's professional life and um and the court again said it it's your the high Court's approach was to be deprecated now as a leader I would submit that and especially when you yourself have now said that there is given recent retirements a bit of a a shortage in the skill school a lot of new judges and you're relying a lot on acting judges being a leader also requires mentorship and leading by example and the question I suppose is is how do you propose to do that when the sea in quite unusual terms it's not or let me rather say it's not usual for the sca when dismissing or upholding an appeal to speak in such terms of a court quo handling of a matter what confidence does that instill in the public public and those appearing in your Division and and those acting in your Division and new judges who look to you for leadership on not only management front but technical abilities thank you very much for that question I just need to respond uh to the previous question regarding the role of my secretary honorable Commissioners it is so that my secretary is interfac with the between my office and the judges and it is so that my secretary would send out emails uh say for example it's the motion Court role she would say to the judges in closed de with please find the motion Court role and she would sign it off as my secretary uh obviously all the judges know all the correspondents that emanates from my office from my secretary uh emanates uh is there is sent on my instructions if it's a document on which they must comment my secretary would say Dear honorable judges in close please find a document uh uh for your attention that is the nature of the uh correspondence between my secretary and the judges um I don't find anything concerning about that uh my secretary does not issue instructions to a judge and says Please do this and don't do that and uh it's all within a formal framework is to convey information from our office to send out a document for their attention to inform them of the role or inform them of something that's happening next term uh or to it can be a memorial that's arranged she notifies them that this is the time this is the date Etc so uh honorable Commissioners there's no need for concern in terms of the manner in which my register communicates with the judges most of the the communication is actually quite clinical and just informative and to inform them of a situation as to when something's happening or if there's a visit uh a delegation that may come out uh allocation of next terms motion Court role is information that is being conveyed no judge needs to respond to anything that my secretary forged to them because it's Clinic IAL information with regard just of clarity does this secretary communicate directly with the judges or with the judges secretaries so that they can inform their principales that's correct how does it work uh the email goes uh to the judges secretaries not to the judges no some of the some of the emails is for the judges and the secretaries are included say it's the motion Court role and then she will say de honorable judges in closed year with please find motion Court role for next term that is how it's done uh chief justice there's a reason for that because we our our computers intermittently uh goes off and at least if it we send it to both we know someone is going to get it but that is just a clinical role that's going out chief justice there are no instructions involved it's just clinical information or there's a memorial service then it will go out to the registers as well as the judges that is the way it is done I must say though that I find that practice quite unusual well speaking for myself I've not encountered it in my 24 years on the bench that a sec a colleague communicates with me via the secretary a secretary will communicate with the secretary then my secretary will communicate with me if the colleague is too busy yes communicate with me herself or himself yeah uh chief justice as the acting uh a a uh that as the djp in the division that is how it is done in our division if it's clinical information it goes to the regist only if it impacts on the regist only remember our system uh computer systems are off intermittently and it happened uh quite often where the judges are not aware of something that is happening and it's some time ago that the decision was made to include the regist was also in those Communications because the system is intermittently off and the judges accepted that it wasn't a problem but it's all clinical information so if there's a memorial service the the the the email would go to the regist that the regist must know because some of them attend a memorial service and the judges would be told this is the time you must be there etc etc so that is the way it's been done I didn't change any form way of communicating the way the former judge president did it I didn't do that and we had lots of technical issues in the building and it was later accepted that information was rather be disseminated two ways that the judge and the regist some issues only impact on secretaries in those instances the judges are not included unnecessarily um so uh what I did is just I just followed through with the way things have always been done in the division I didn't change anything chief justice and Commissioners with regard to the two cases mentioned I have been uh interrogated about just before you carry on there's a followup question on the last aspect from JP Mambo good morning uh acting judge president good morning pleas um I just want to refer you because this communication judge to judge or judge secretary to judges is a serious issue in the Judiciary as a CJ put it to you yes um one of the annexures to your to your pack um sorry I'm using case lines it's page 4145 it's an email from your secretary well I I take it as from your secretary um but it signed ajp at the bottom but it clearly comes from elar receivers I don't know if you want to look at it because I want to know because it's head at dear colleagues yes now a secretary can say dear colleagues to judges but this email is sent to judges it's it's got ajp at the bottom I need to to get clarity who sent this email uh Chief Joseph if it says ajp it means I stood next to her and I dictated it to her it comes from me and then at the bottom it will show that she is my secretary perhaps uh with hindsight I should have had my own stamp at the bottom yes I don't think it's a question of having your own stamp because when I receive emails like this from a secretary even if it's got a judge's name at the bottom I will respond to the secretary to say tell your judge to speak to me because this is an email from from your secretary my question is why is it not an email from yourself uh uh uh JP I understand uh the issue that you are raising um when I assumed my position as djp the former JP's regist would also put her name in at the bottom and I was trained that there's an understanding that any correspondence that comes from my regist comes with my instructions and that is something that the former JP always instilled in the judges but the point is duly noted uh it says Dear colleagues it means that I have dictated it to her and I typed my name at the bottom and then at the bottom the secretary's stamp would be there so what I did I I I changed uh I changed that with my secretary uh uh when my secretary types matters now she would say on that she's sending an email on behalf of my office um what I can say about uh the fact that my secretary sends out the email that happened in the former JP's office also his registra would circulate an email no matter what it was whether it was the role we we we we are not particularly concerned uh with what happened before your time a so I I would be happier if you just limited yourself you've done in that Division and plan to do for that Division if there's anything to be done so so if if I can just conclude that point when it says a it means it comes from me and then her stamp is just at the bottom as my regist yes Min um anything oh sorry there's sorry a I should have warned you there's another followup question I'm sorry George good morning Commissioners good morning how are you I'm very well thank just a follow up on that um um in the judge Ali complained she also raises the matter of the secretary communicating directly with the judges and she actually says she has raised the matter online in response to the PA who had not indicated that she was acting on your instruction it's actually paragraph 6.12 she says I then took the matter with the email in response and the secretary then resend the email with the words on the instruction of the AGP a ajp I I think the way the communication and earlier on you said you are strong in communication this indicates a weakness in communication with your colleagues would you agree with me if I say so and and futuristically how do you hope to improve on the communication with your colleagues I I wouldn't want to assume that you're are too busy to send a three line email to your colleagues and and just informing them about the unopposed motion role for the following term and then you attach it and it goes yes that is exactly uh thank you just follow up chief justice because it's also on this paragraph 6.12 all right yes there's another problem uh uh ajp which is not just communication because I understand your point to be if it's formal communication there's no problem it can be sent by anyone attaching a role Etc now I understand that fully I don't have a problem with it but it looks like it's more than formal communication it's actually a substantive to work that is being conveyed through the secretary I think that's really the concern so the example that is made here at 6.11 is that your secretary has taken files to judge Ali and then judge Ali says to her no no no I already have a file and then she says to her well why don't you do this one virtually and she does so without even discussing with you so I think it goes beyond this is just formal communication into to it's substantive judicial instructions that are conveyed through the secretary so the secretary's role is elevated which is perceived to be offensive by your colleagues that that's really the heart of what you must respond to thank you commissioner uh Commissioners that specific incident that is referred to my registra does not give the judges any instructions my registra because we have a shortage of ushers um we have a shortage of ushers so my registra doubles up as an usher remember there are 33 judges and only 16 ushers in the building and if the criminal trials run then the ushers are occupied in the criminal courts and then we don't have ushers to deliver files uh Commissioners that specific incident that is referred to was not any instruction given to any judge it was just the delivery of a file and um when I saw that comment I questioned my registra about it because my regist is quite experienced and she's very um she understands protocol very well she was nothing more than an usher on that specific day and it happened to be on a Friday when that happened uh opposed motions allocations were made the Friday for the Monday and uh judge Ali uh received the file from my regist my regist never gives instructions to any judges that was pure and simple ushering duties my regist has no interest whether a judge does a case virtually or in court and my regist personally had no knowledge of doing that because she multitasks as my regist thank you and as an usher it was purely ushering Beauty with regard to uh the signing of correspondents I can understand that um someone may have an issue but if if if she signs it it's formal uh it's a role that's being circulated or is the reserve judgment role that gets circulated the regist signs that some correspondents would be from me whether I circulate uh the uh information for comment that can also come from me or or it will say ajp with with her name as my secretary at the bottom but it will Clearly say it comes from me formal uh correspondence would can come directly from my secretary but I'd like to reassure the commission that I do put ajp under correspondence that I have dictated personally to the judges quite often uh so if I can just clarify the point with regard to my regist telling a judge do it virtually uh Commissioners that is not the case my regist would not even open that file to see the mode of the trial it was a simple case where file was allocated with the name of the judge on and she was just performing ushering duties nothing more nothing less and she still performs ushering duties if the ushers are not available to go and deliver files so I think that Act of hers is taken out of context because she does not know the modalities and she cannot dictate to any judge how to conduct a hearing and and and hence I do dispute that allegation that my regist attempted to tell someone how to hear a matter that is not the case it was a simple delivery of a file yes but she says that she never got any communication from you which left her uncertain about whether in fact this had come from you or it could come from your secretary uh uh commissioner she the the judge won't receive communication from me with allocations they get the file 2 days before the time their names are put on the file and it gets entered into the register so I don't communicate with the judge and say I'm sending this matter to you today I'm sending that matter to you tomorrow our system works like this we allocate in advance depending on availability the ushers collect the files that's been allocated with the name names of the judges on and that and they manage the ushers will deliver the files you don't email every judge every day to say here's this matter there's this matter that is not how the system works so they can receive a file today for a matter to be heard 2 weeks from now and if there's not an usher to deliver it my secretary will go and deliver the file on on behalf of my office um oh sorry is there anything else commissioner B still followup questions a yes yes thank thank you chief justice good morning judge good morning it's it's a slightly different angle but to this topic still the the Chief Justice asked you um more than once what it is that you would still do in the division by way of improvements and new things and you were asked once I mean more than once um and in your responses you were referring to what you have done now I would have thought that a letter this this submission from Judge Ali for example would give you an opportunity to reflect on what you would need to do if you appointed judge president because clearly according to her uh or according to her there are issues uh that need to be resolved but in instead of you saying or acknowledging this you have taken a stance that uh what she's saying there's no merit to what she saying and your attitude is that the end of the matter I I I'm quite disappointed I must say by the tone and the manner of your response to this but perhaps more seriously by your register's response um where she speaks about a judge to say her statements are deplorable that that kind of language and that you would include this without moderating it you would include it to be put before the this panel about a judge that you're going to go back to work with and if you're appointed to the position uh lead and hopefully at least as far as we we hope have a collegial relationship with her that you would allow firstly without moderating that the your register would speak in these t I'm particularly concerned about that um because I perceive of a role of a judge president as being the the the moderator among equals and among staff and so expected that you would tone you would tell her to tone down her language address the complaints or the issues that are being raised without speaking in this way to me it seems It's it appears to be as absolute disrespect and you don't seem to to have to have noted it that your register should never speak like that to any judge whatsoever in fact not even to her colleagues but but I'm also particularly disappointed that when you read when you respond to judge Ali you come out as more defensive um than acknowledging this is an indicator of an issue of issues that require addressing the minute issue it doesn't help to keep saying we stop taking minute minutes 10 years ago clearly there's a judge now who thinks we should keep minutes and I would expect a leader to say that clearly means there's an issue to be addressed and I would go back and address it do you have any comments to that it is concerns that I have and they seem to me to speak perhaps to a failing of leadership commissioner I did respond to judge Ali's concerns um it is so that she has raised issues and I have responded to it and if I can refer to the issues regarding minutes I am keeping a record of what happens at the meetings uh I must agree that perhaps this the tone of my secretary's response uh could could have been better um my secretary was just felt AG griefed that a specific Judge said that she mustn't deal directly with her but I will consider see that the tone uh should have been better the issues raised by judge Ali I indicated to the commission that I'm happy to respond to all of it um with regard to my registra responding to judges obviously that is a lesson to be learned to the extent that my name should then rather just be typed should just put ajp at the bottom and then her name underneath as my secret her stamp it's actually her stamp it should pass possibly preferably have been my stamp um some of the concerns raised by judge ali uh uh commissioner I have responded to it I don't necessarily regard it as being defensive I will concede I've I've given an explanation as to how my office functions uh with regard to minutes that is something that can be raised at a judge's meeting quite frankly judge Ali could have raised it with me earlier all the issues she has raised there could have been raised with me earlier yes I I I accept a JP I accept that she could have raised the issues earlier but they have been raised in this way and and my what I'm putting to you is your response in the manner in which she she has raised them uh seems to indicate a failing in a leader responding to matters raised in the wrong way maybe um but that the Instinct of a leader should be it seems to me to accept that indicates there's a problem that does need to be to be dealt with differently but I do understand your your answer thank you yes thank you commissioner I feel that most of the issues raised could have been dealt with uh directly I have responded to the issue of minutes that I do record I've responded to the distinction between expedited dates and semi-urgent dates I have responded to the fact that my secretary communicates on clinical issues with the with the judges and sometimes the emails would go directly to the regist depending on what it is um Commissioners with regard to issues raised by Ali I I did not um my my intention was to respond to the issue not necessarily to defend myself because if there's a difference between an expedited date and a semi-urgent and an urgent date I felt that I needed to clarify so in that respect I considered my response to be more clarification because judge Ali doesn't is not aware of all the processes uh that happens in my office um I have noted uh the the the comments and of obviously I have spoken to my secretary about that in terms of remedying a concern raised by one judge in the division in terms of the manner the communication gets circulated and uh I just followed up on the way it has always been done through the regist we do we send clinical emails but um yes I am alive to the fact that some judges May then take offense and judge Ali then expressed that she took offense to that um is there anything else I just needed to respond to wait there's still more for questions commissioner thank no no there are two two followup questions before you commissioner I've noted Youk thank you chief justice good morning ajp Goliath I just wanted to follow up to on the answer to the question posed by commissioner MBI around the specific incident referred to by judge Ali in her in her her document uh the one um relating to the allocation of files a comment made by your by your secretary did I understand your answer to be that that's an untruth by judge Ali I have raised it with my secretary but the SEC the secretary indicated to me that she was merely delivering the file because look that was the instruction she acts as an usher and the secretary indicated that she did not instruct the judge how to hear the matter uh commissioner the secretaries cannot dictate to a judge how to hear a matter so obviously my secretary indicated that she that was not what she had said the file was marked and she acted as an usher and it happens on a daily basis that my secretary delivers files to judges ajp the thrust of my question is um is what you're saying to the commission that judge Ali in her comment to the commissioner commission included a fabrication or an untruth I am saying to the commissioner that I addressed that issue with my registra and she indicated to me that she did not indicate to the judge how to hear a matter she was merely performing duties of an ashra and and did you have the similar discussion with judge Ali no I did not have that discussion with judge Ali I just instructed my regist and indicated to her that it may be best that we rather just get wait for an to deliver it because uh it was taken this this incident had happened uh Commissioners my secretaries there for many years and she knows protocols she will not instruct a judge ajp I'm sorry to interrupt you I really don't want to have a discussion about your secret I'm more concerned about what you're saying about one of the judges in your division that's my concern and can I just finish my question before you answer you see it ties into what you something you said much earlier in your in your exchange with the CJ you urged us in your words to treat judge Ali's comments with caution now that's a very serious thing to ask the JC to do in particular when you're talking about a sitting judge now you also in your your written responses tie that in to judge Ali's membership of Nadal which is even more concerning now can I ask you to please address that question firstly how it is that you can ask this body to treat the comments by a sitting judge with caution and secondly how it is that you tie that into her her membership with of Nadal Commissioners I have given an indication that judge Ali and I we were together uh we were candidates for the position of uh Deputy judge president um and since my appointment it is so that judge Ali did not communicate with me at all it is so that at that stage Nadal did Mo uh mobilize support for judge Ali and it uh she wasn't appointed so from that Vantage Point although judge Ali stated in his submissions that she is raising this because she's got nothing to lose and she's due to retire etc etc I had a concern about the fact that it appeared as if uh the fact that we were up against one another that it may have impacted negatively on our relationship and uh that judge ali uh she she raised certain issues um concerns that I felt I could explain adequately to the Dr in terms of the manner in which I run the office but my main concern was uh why did Judge Ali not address it directly with me that was my concern because judge Ali chose to use this platform and that was where the caution caution request came in because it was something she could have raised easily with me to take a walk up to my office and we could have resed any of her concerns and that it's in that context that I asked the commission to just be cautious because why didn't someone do the obvious but I understand the concern raised with regard to the fact that I now need to decide am I believing what my regist says and judge Ali says obviously if I can just conclude the earlier point I must believe what a judge says if a judge says something happened I must believe leave the judge and I did raise it with my registra and my regist said but judge I was just performing ushering duties you mentioned that ajp yes and can you please address the insinuation that Nadal is using judge Ali as an instrument against you um Commissioners luk Nadal issued a media statement in May where they uh requested uh individuals and organization ations to collaborate with them to support a candidate and that happened that is the reality of the matter judge Ali is Affiliated to Nadal they nominated her at the time Nadal did seek collaboration from stakeholders and from uh individuals uh it was a public document and um I I I I I I I didn't for me it was unambiguous to the extent that that that Nadal was seeking collaboration and um judge Ali was a long-standing member of Nadal and Nadal did nominate her for the position of djp in that round when I was successful um I I'm not saying that Nadal is using judge Ali for spe specific purpose I'm saying Nadal publicly did invite people to support their cause and to collaborate with them and just the mere fact of Judge Ali's connection with Nadal it's not an arms length person who had no ties with Nadal at all after all they did nominate her um for me it's just a factual situation the invitation went out and um that is the ultimate uh uh strategy that that Nadal called for and people did and and and they were they invited people to come in judge Ali has never been to my chamber since I was appointed as the djp uh so I would imagine that there could be a little bit of uh there could be issues that she may have since my appointment in 2016 she's never been to my Chambers in case I forget I'm at that age just just on on this last Point uh have you ever been to judge Ali Chambers as her leader yes I have been to judge Ali Chambers all right yes that that pacifies me just the last last followup ajp on the question of Nadal U do you believe um ajp that every person who is a member of Nadal will be biased against you no definitely not the position with Jud Ali is just the connection is just that they nominated her as deputy and I was in the successful candidate that's the only connection I can make I cannot have a blanket approach and say everyone I was also a member of Nadal so I most certainly cannot have a blanket approach and and and adopt that situation judge Ali's position is just unique in that we were up together for the position of djp she has raised certain issues that she could have raised with me directly some valid some not so valid I have responded to it I've I've noted the commissioner stance that says that as a leader I must say how am I going to fix it yes I am quite willing to fix whatever needs to be fixed but my responses that I gave was an explanation as to how my office functions and that is why I said if the Commissioners ask me on a specific aspect raised by judge Ali I am happy to respond there too so the situation with Jud Ali is just different different because we were up against each other for Deputy um and that makes for me that makes her situation unique that is all nothing more than that and I most certainly cannot have a blanket approach to all members of Nadal definitely not sorry chief justice sorry I know we haven't even gotten to a response to my second question but but I really need to address this because AGP you're not taking this commission into your confidence the issue with Nadal is not relating to what happened when you applied both for the djp No in fact you've asked that one of the other Commissioners recuse himself because of his membership or his affiliation with because a competitor yeah to this role is I suppose affiliated with always their chosen or supported candidate this it's not about what happened in the past and yes judge Ali has an ax to grind because she was unsuccessful the insinuation is is that you are using her her or they used her to ensure that their preferred candidate in this process gets the nod and you don't which is essentially accusing judge Ali of being part of a conspiracy along with fellow Commissioners that is a very serious accusation and it's not to do with grudges in the past you are accusing people of essentially something that verges on Criminal CJ CJ may I please follow up on that with your permission yes commissioner yes while you deal with that um ajp gath the could you please also deal and in similar vein we we've had an issue uh where you've expressed concern about the the the the the ability to remain unbiased and neutral of a a senior judge of your court that that was supposed to sit here who participated in the short listing and you you you demanded uh rather in fact you instructed that he recused himself you recused him and you appointed somebody else to come and stand in your place as your designate now the reason you gave for that is exactly the same as the basis on which you were seeking commissioner uh the one commissioner's uh recusal it is because of their familiarity to your competitor and so you do not trust uh that the judge will fairly openly and objectively exercise their duties and discharge their responsibility in evaluating you fairly so could you please while you respond to the Nadel is should deal with that as well commissioner judge Ali mentioned in her submissions that she that she has no agendas she mentioned that herself and when I saw that I thought what why is Judge Ali saying this it's not necessary to say this if you don't have an agenda and the connection with judge ali uh the fact is that Nadal uh she is a member of Nadal and they did nominate her previously I am not saying that judge Ali she be a member of the judge yeah she was just like I was I I was also a m many of us many of us on the bench judge Ali triggered this concern by me because she said herself I don't have ulterior motives I've got nothing to lose that what she said herself and I looked at it and I thought but why is she saying this if it's all above board she triggered that concern by me and um the Nadal sent a a circular around uh and made it clear that this that they support a certain candidate there's no problem with that the only problem I had with the circular was was the fact that it created the impression that the Western cave division was in disarray and I felt that that was not the correct statement to might if that was not in the statement I would not have had any concerns the fact because that is not the correct statement was not about supporting another candidate whatever the division is not in this array and I can assure the commissioners of that um I just need to respond to um the uh if anyone no I need I need to make a follow up CJ sure there still is another follow up before you commissioner Mal on this very issue from president M or had you had you finished uh commissioner B because we kept interjecting uh Chief there just so much to deal with I'm I'll keep thank you and you you you you satisfied Mr poov yes thank you all right I wanted to remind CJ that we spend two hours on this candidate two hours I am fully aware commissioner Willam thank you thank you very much uh CJ um my followup am I audible yes we can hear you okay thank you yes um good morning good morning commission sister how are you I'm very well thank you just to put on record that you and I have um interacted frequently in relation to me requesting you to release some of your colleagues for purposes of acting at the at the sca and that has worked well thank you yes um my followup pertains to the issue of the taking off minutes um you indicated that uh you were a scribe in 2010 and then there was a resolution that uh uh minutes should no longer be taken um and then you took over as the ajp and then you started uh making notes or recording notes for purposes of an action plan my question to you is um well the the CJ also asked you whether there's any room for improvement that you see and my question is whether you do not regard the issues that have been raised by J by judge Ali as a indication of the need to keep proper records in accordance with standard uh meeting procedures and to circulate these records especially because you indicated that not all the judges can attend meetings at all all all the time meaning that if these minutes are circulated then even the judges that did not attend the me uh the meetings would then be kept a breast of the discussions of that meeting I I posed this in relation to one of your responses uh to the CJ where you said you said that uh it is evident that judge Ali is not aware of some of the processes that you have put in place and I mean discussions that are are had at judges meetings if they are recorded even if she did not attend a particular meeting she would know that this was discussed and this is how it is being attended to so with the benefit of hindsight would you concede then that the area in relation to the keeping of minutes is one area in which there could be an improvement on your side going forward thank you thank you very much for that question most certainly I agree that we can do better in that regard um Commissioners uh my first meeting that I held with a judge where I asked the judges to have the conversation I did minute that meeting because I wanted to record exactly what the it's our first meeting after 6 years and I did circulate uh the minutes and the minutes ended up outside of the building and with the secretaries the court manager came to me and said certain things were said about her uh in the minutes minutes were circulated and then a Senor judge uh came to me and reminded me that there is a resolution that no minutes will be taken so from the second minute the second meeting onwards I only made notes in respect of an action plan uh so Commissioners I agree with what uh president Mela has indicated we can most certainly improve on that and it is something that will have to be discussed at the judge's meeting so that we can take a definite uh resolution as to how we will be going uh forward uh in the since there is a resolution still in place not to not to keep keep minutes um and the fact that I'm keeping an action log and and and and actioning things and dealing with the different committees Etc may not be enough it would probably be advisable to have some other system in place uh with the concurrence of the judges system since uh that resolution still stands thank you ajp but before you get to the second part of Mr bop's uh question concerning uh Thea's comments on your judgment I just want to remind uh commission malma and the other Commissioners that this is a critical leadership position in a notoriously troubled division of of of of of the high court in this country so I cannot stop uh Commissioners from asking uh questions about concerns concerns relating to Serious matters that they may have so if it take we have to take longer with a candidate then that's just what we must do so that at the end of the day we know that we have chosen the right person to lead that court so that's why we're taking so long commissioner malma uh back to you ajp are you ready to no my followup yes oh you you had to follow up yes I thought you just wanted to remind the time this is why ask you follow up that commission no I want to just make a follow up on two points quickly ajp The Advocate valo commissioner valo raised an issue with you about how your secretary responded to a judge and you said well that is not the right way to communicate but she was angry or upset that they they accused of whatever they did before commissioner Balo put that to you as a leader of the Court who read what she said in response to judge Ali did you take it upon yourself to say but you cannot address a judge like this to your secretary did you say that to her I did not say that to to her and I think I should probably have done better in that regard uh but uh she indicated that she wanted to to make her own statement but I think I should have done better to intervene there and you see that is lack of judgment from a leader because a a good leader would have picked that up and immediately deal with it do you accept that that is lack of judgment from leadership position I should definitely have asked her to tone down her response commissioner yes so um ajp you not in the meeting where she was where it is alleged was instructing a judge to conduct the matter in a particular way and judge Ali makes that allegation and she denies that and then you come to justify before us that she's senior she will not have made such a mistake she knows how the things work and that we should without you saying it but by how you saying it we should believe her over your colleague over a judge and you have not spoken to that judge you have just spoken to one person who's your secretary did not speak to the judge to verify the facts and whatever the situation might be but your justification here is that no she's so senior so experienced she will not make such a mistake she will never give a judge an instruction when a judge says I was given an instruction and we must believe here over a judge of your court a JP uh commissioner the fact of the matter is that it is a problem for for for me to say don't believe the judge I'm not saying that here today I am saying that my registra is used to delivering files and and conducting playing the role of an usher since I'm a a a djp since 2016 already and um she is alive to the fact that it is just a delivery and if that had happened it is unfortunate and I cannot say today believe my registra commissioner I can't say that I must accept what the judge says uh I just try to impress upon the commission that the delivery of files is within the normal uh cause of my regist duty uh and and that's the sole purpose is just delivery of a file not to engage judges on the matter and in and quite frankly it gets placed in a basket in let me just clarify that to the Commissioners it doesn't you don't knock on the door of the chambers it gets placed in a in a tray uh by the by the judges Chambers yeah that is how deliveries are made the Usher will do that replace it in the Inay and then there's the outray the user will collect the files so the delivery of the file it wasn't she wasn't sent as a messenger to the judge concern she was merely sent to place it in the tray in the Inay that is all sorry we still have other full up questions sorry commission questions Mr commissioner okay thank you thank you commission thank you thank thank you thank you CJ good morning uh ADP good morning just want to to to make a followup on the correlation that was drawn by by commissioner Balo on the on the uh designation of alternative uh on Church rasmas yes and uh Church ali uh the on the question that was raised by the CJ around what is it that could be done to improve the stability uh on the division uh the the question that I want to ask is don't you think that your your your approach your approach on Judge Ali and also on Judge rasmas uh is uh devoid on the quest to create stability uh in the division because uh definitely H the the the insinuation that one is throwing is that your stance on uh orth throwing Judas Midway through the process also creates a bit of a leadership Discord on how you manage the issues of Court don't you think you should have handled the matter differently because now uh you can imagine uh the relationship between judge Gamble and judge rasmas I suspect is something that you need to work on to stabilize it thank you if if I can just uh conclude uh with regard to the issue of Judge ali uh uh I'm sitting here with a list of the stuff that she has raised now um she referred to the allocation of Duty for unopposed motion role she had a concern that um when judges are involved in criminal matters they shouldn't be taken out of crime because there's a continuous role I have responded to that to explain to the commission that the continuous role will be disrupted because of criminal matters where we have 80% of the judges in crime uh the allocation of the duty of the unopposed motion role is done in an equitable manner uh because it involves weaken Duty and it so happens that some judges were allocated to this uh allocation Duty in the Unos motion Ro two three times per term which translates into working two three weekends per term so I have responded to that to explain that I I adopted an equitable system of allocating the unposed duty role to all judges if they are in crime they sit out for 4 days out of the crime during that week that they are allocated the unopposed motion role it's an equitable system it's a transparent system and the majority of the judges were happy with the way I did the allocation of Duty for the unopposed role judge Ali raised the issue of expedited dates I have explained to the commission that there's no list of criteria for the allocation of expedited dates I've been doing that since I was the djp and that judge Ali is confusing expedited dates with urgent and semi-urgent matters expedited dates are granted in a transparent manner both legal all the legal Representatives must apply together for an expeditor date based on the merits of the case it will be approved the from there it goes to the fourth division Clark who will then find an earlier slot for the parties in that matter so I've responded to that designation of Judges as Junior and senior it is so when we allocate full bench appeals we try to allocate one senior judge in the high higher hierarchy and then a mid judge with mid middle less experience and then we also put what we would call a junior judge a three bench judge so that the junior judge can then gain that experience by getting exposure to different judges so that is basically the only uh reference where one would talk about Junior and senior but in any event I have responded here and I said that allocations are done privately and there's no discussion around do junior or senior when allocations are made judge Ali raised the question of questionable statistics and Performance Tools the stats is completely out of my hands I have no interest in the stats it is done by it is done by the statistician uh using objective criteria when the stats computed failure to circulate ously I've responded I've indicated that the resolutions were were indeed uh uh circulated uh the the the the phase one was not under my leadership the rationalization report was circulated and the meeting that judge Ali referred to in her papers was in fact a meeting where I went to convey to them the judges what issues that were raised in heads of Court concerns that my SEC that my secret is allowed to communicate directly with judges I have noted I've noted that I've noted the concerns raised with that it is so that my secretary um does send out correspondence uh and communicates with the judges and the registrants I have noted duly noted that point uh that was taken um no records of decision taken that meeting I have noted uh that Point as well and I think uh based on the question of President Mela there is definitely room to improve the judges need to make that decision because I've explained when I circulated the minutes of the first meeting it was a problem and I was reminded of this resolution so that is something that the judges will have to to to to to to to work with uh with regard to my registr respond I concede that uh I should have intervened and perhaps she should have toned down uh her response um before I get to I Don't Know Chief Justice I'm in your hands do you need me to respond there was there was the issue raised by commissioner Balo and and and fortified by Mr bosov about your what Your withdrawal of um your colleagues designation judge rasas and then uh your your demand for one of the Commissioners to recuse themselves because they they are NAD yes uh it is correct that I did demand uh one of the Commissioners who holds an office in Nadal to recuse himself um it is so that the test for recusal is objective uh and whether a reasonable objective and informed person would on the on all the facts uh reasonably apprehend that someone will not be able to bring an impartial mind uh in the matter and in the assessment of candidate or that that person wouldn't be open to persuasion it was purely done on that basis to ask the president of Nadal to recuse himself nothing more nothing less uh I try to although I'm subjective I try to uh put myself in in the shoes of an objective person and um I felt a sense of anxiety and it was my view that even looking from the outside in if uh if the president of Nadal sits here having circulated the memorandum uh it creates the impression that the mind his mind was made up and that he would not be open open to persuasion uh it was purely on that basis that I made that request had that uh memorandum not been uh the media statement not been made I would not have uh asked for for his recusal but the main reason for the recusal is not the support of a different candidate the main reason for the recusal is the fact that an incorrect statement was made made uh in the state media statement that the division is in disarray and the division is not in disarray the waters are calm the ship is sailing it's not perfect but it's much much better from where it has been um um so that recusal must be viewed in that light it was a public document it was circulated and I attempted to apply that objective test and I did say to myself but if someone already uh belongs to this organization and it's already indicated this is the preferred candidate I felt that perhaps it would be best uh if that person is not party to sits on the commission because I had concerns whether that person would be able to apply uh his uh mind um going forward uh uh in to to apply uh would be open to persuasion because a decision was made before any interviews or anything um would that cover that your withdrawal of Judge aras's designation to this body yes um the the uh Commissioners the short listing process uh occurred uh in this manner I was instructed by the Chief Justice uh to to uh let judge Erasmus attend to the short listing which chief justice chief chief justice zondo former Chief Justice zondo indicated that jasmus must do the short list um we are in a unique situation because I'm also a candidate so the former Chief Justice then uh recommended that uh judge Erasmus must attend to the short listing and I Abid it uh by that uh decision follow up CJ on on on this point I think let her finish she she's still talking yes yes I received a call from the JSC uh instructing me to let judge Erasmus attend to the short listing Commissioners I received that phone call and then Judas attended to the short listing I abide it and if I if I can go further the then the short listing did take place and then um I then when I saw the short list I just saw someone name on the list that he has a very close relationship with judge Erasmus and at that stage I didn't make any designation uh yet when I when when the short list came out so that was my concern where he was concerned it's just the fact that he's got a it's a friend of his and that was um my only concern with judge arasmus um I thought he may be conflicted with one of his friends being shortlisted uh nothing more nothing less um so firstly I didn't designate him to do the short listing that was on the instruction of former Chief Justice zondo after the short listing I had a conversation with judge erasmas I said to him look your friend is on this list I I have concerns about that so I will not be able to designate you uh to attend to the JC today he did try to persuade me to say no he will be able to apply an impartial mind but I thought um I I have a concern because I know personally that he that his is his friend uh on the list um and uh then I did my designation on the 8th of August I designated uh uh judge gamble after considering uh my options I designated judge Gamble and that was the only designation I made the Chief Justice designated judge Erasmus I did consider designating judge Erasmus but when the short list came out I then designated judge gamble instead so from where I said I didn't change any designation at all I just exercise applied my mind uh in terms of section 178k after the short listing to designate a judge and um my uh my my motivation was to designate a judge that has no close ties with any of the candidates none of us are friends with this particular judge and um we don't have lunch we don't have breakfast nothing with this particular judge I'm not particularly close to the judge the the judge that I designated is due to retire on the 10th of November and that judge holds no allegiance to anyone of of of the candidates at all so if I can then just before you move on uh AGP I I just want to understand why uh judge erasmus's close connection with any of of the candidates would have bothered you because you you've been a charge long enough we all know that since the beginning of time since this body started operating Commissioners including the chair person on occasion have declared openly that they have a relationship with one of of of of of the of of of of the of the candidates and it's never been an issue I I recall an example where Chief former Chief Justice mang interviewed his close friend former Chief Justice zondo and he made that declaration openly before the interview started and it was it was not an issue and a fair result was was was achieved I'd like to than so why were you particularly bothered by judge rasmus's involvement in these proceedings yeah chief justice look um I'm 34 years in the profession and yes I was concerned about that it may not it may not be uh based on what you have informed me now may not have been uh the correct approach not to designate him but at that stage after the short listing I had a choice as to who I would like to designate and um the Chief Justice zondo designated him to do the short listing um and I exercise my discretion as in terms of who I wanted to designate to represent the division uh yes uh it was a concern and I've heard what the Chief Justice had said uh I just felt uncomfortable with the fact that one of the candidates was very close uh to him and I've heard noted what the Chief Justice said but uh the commission must remember that was was I uh and I'm trying to understand this is the is the suggestion that because the Chief Justice designated uh one judge that I had to stick to that judge because if that is the case uh then then I understand what the concern is about but I thought I was just exercising my constitutional right to take someone who's not connected to anyone and who's due to retire and you can sit here objectively and and and and represent the division what was commissioner there are other followup questions before I wanted to follow what you just asked earlier okay I wanted to ask are you aware of the incident that the CJ is talking about as a judge you have been on the bench for quite some time you'll be familiar with what she spoke about and when you had those concerns those concerns would have now been put at ease by that experience which we are speaking about h and a JP you're not going to give us the second reason because you build reason as you go your initial and your honest reason is that he Erasmus is a friend with a candidate not that I was exercising my rights you the rights is something that you are now trying to put here now after giving us an unacceptable explanation so do you realize that you were wrong to remove him on the basis of the friendship with another candidate because that has never affected this body and this body is not erasmas commission it's the Judicial Service Commission there's no erasmas who going to take a decision here alone so whether he's got a preferred candidate or not this body must still take a final decision as to who's going to be do you accept you were wrong by taking such a decision on a fellow judge and say on the basis of a friendship this judge will never be objective and will not judge me or score me fairly do you think you are right by removing a fellow judge on the basis that he's a friend with a candidate do you accept your wrong I I accept that uh having listened to what the Chief Justice says that you can interview a friend and example made um the fact of the matter is that I have never designated uh judge Erasmus in the first place the Chief Justice designated him and I was of the view that I could exercise my right to designate an alterate and I'm I'm hearing uh what the honorable commissioner has said um what the honorable commissioner is saying that I should have retained the person who had done the short listing uh I should have retained that person there um my concern was do I am I entitled to appoint a designate or not because I did not I was not involved in designating anyone for short listing and I suppose it is desirable to keep the person in but is it wrong for for me to to exercise my right to designate an alternate that has no connection with with any of the candidates uh I thought that I was designating someone that I was satisfied has is not connected I've heard the sentiments that the fact that Erasmus was closely connected to one of the candidates uh did not justify me not designating him I I I heard that statement and um at the time I just felt that I didn't want him to feel compromised uh by sitting in on proceedings where one of his close friends uh well uh commissioner Professor ask for a follow up chief justice I'm terribly sorry commissioner no but it's just cor effect and I don't I think it's a it's a real problem yes so I'm sorry Professor uh you know that I don't he he he he he he's the convenor of the objections committee and they've been dealing with this so he gets first dips because of that yes thank you I also tried to apologize to the professor um the problem ajp is that you've now I think four times said you you never made the decision to assign uh judge arasmus to attend to the short list that was done by the Chief Justice the Chief Justice instructed me to to to designate him yes former Chief Justice well that's now yes that's now a different Espin on it but the problem is that on the 8th of July 2024 you wrote to the Secretariat yeah and your email says our telephonic conversation refers please be advised that judge arasmus will be attending to the screening and short disting of the candidates nominated for the position of Judge president of the Western Cape division of the high court I will be attending to the screening and short listing of the four vacancies in the division kindly confirm the time scheduled for the short listing of the four vacancies in the Western Cape division so whatever was happening in the background it was your decision to send judge arasmus yes I I I did I did send judge arasmus I I complied with the directive of the former Chief Justice I did and since I was a candidate that was more reason why I complied yes I did yes sorry chief justice was just to correct the fact that jge zondo had nothing to do with it it was the candidate thank you commissioner I accept that I have sent that letter through and that that letter confirmed the designation of Judge Erasmus to attend to the short listing I did commissioner your hand was up hours ago yeah no just I mean on on this point you know um I'm saying that with great respect to you and I highly hold you in high esteem as a judge by removing judge arasmus and seeking for Commissioners to recuse themselves all what they do doing you were designing your own interview panel that is it I accept nothing else all what I mean I must put it this simple so that we understand so that everyone do understand what we doing yeah the first thing the first thing you do you want Commissioners to recuse themselves for flimsy reasons and you in the process even I mean forance I hear you say I circulated a statement this not such a thing in can two you designate I mean judges to interview you that's why you interfere in a process where you are directly involved and you don't just interfere you actively involved yourself the whole point is that you just wanted you have to have your own interview partner and that was wrong of you as one of the lack of your judgment as a church uh commissioner the D issue I have uh raised that already and I have accepted uh the decision that you remain on the panel I have explained that because of the media statement uh dated uh in May that uh I I I felt a sense of of uneasiness about it and you are sitting here now I have accepted that decision uh with regard to the arasmus issue um I do have the I did have the I could designate someone so the main criticism is that because judge IR I know you I mean I don't want to the point I'm I justel out or what I'm putting to you is simple that by involving you in this process Des reming all what do is your own interview is that right for you should we have even in the first place been involved in this process especially after we have disag person must you come again oh no I don't like you I want somebody else and even judge G in terms of your own um what we call a hierarchy of Judges she's not even the second third or fourth in the row she is somewhere in the level in terms of the of your own Senor in that division you see you jump several judges senior judges and then you point something far away so you were P hand picking persons that must in your view must appoint you yeah that only involved two persons and that would be my concern with an adult statement and in the fact that I my uh intention was to designate someone that has no ties with anyone of us and the judge who's out on his way out uh retirement he's got no allegiance to any of the candidates and I considered that to be a better option than someone who is close very close friends with one of the candidates I get your point when you say that it could could create a negative uh impression the fact that I've asked for the refusal of someone who's closely Affiliated to Nadal and the fact that the impression is created that I have intervened in processes in so far as I didn't designate the same person who did the short listing point I'm making in this is that that as a leader of the Court shows for the position that we're applying that you lack judgment you know you you lack judgment and the time you have impulsive judgments you just become I mean oh he was some years he was a member of therefore cannot be you already made that commission and I just want to to did I oh did I say commission you see when your Tri what happens your name is always on my mind Commissioners on a serious note I just uh we uh acting judge president gol has answered this question from all angles EXA so the last do you still insist on asking your on this one issue I'm talking to the others no I'm going I'm I'm going on this for the last the last point I'm on my followups regarding that statement what I've picked up what is striking to me is that the statement by your secret containing those I mean those I mean containing those sessions was written on 26th of September your own response was written on 26th of that is they were written on the same day the Am I Wrong to infer that you were part of the drafting of that statement with your secretary you you actually assisted your secret or you drafted with her because they done on the same time and she would have received the comments from yourself would I be wrong so that's last question um I have informed her of that comment relating to her I did um I did not sit with my secretary and craft assistant to uh craft a response uh her husband is an advocate and I think he assisted her with that I didn't assist her at all with that response actually I just received the response and I think I I I should have sort of studied it more but it it wasn't I didn't write uh the response yeah commissioner commissioner thank you chief justice um ajp um let's allow you some time to catch some breath I want to converse with you a different matter no she still has to answer she has not she hasn't oh she hasn't okay then I can wait then I can wait please thank you Chief Jus I'm just I just it's a factual uh correction of fact um ajp relating to the recusal of Mr MJC wrote to the JC on the 18th of September and the reason you gave is not what you're saying now that you wanted him to recuse because of the deplorable statement or the statement that was made about your division your letter says uh Nadel on the 27th of May issued a media statement in which it's recorded it's national executive had a meeting to call for appointment yes of a judge to be interviewed with you uh and you say the statement was widely circulated and then in the set circumstances you say I submit it would be inappropriate for Mr no Jessi to sit as a commissioner when it conducts interviews and to vote on the appointment a reasonable objective and informed person would on the above facts reasonably apprehend that Mr nese will not bring an impartial mind to the interviews and will not be open to persuasion in respect of this appointment so and and that's really pretty much the end of your letter so the reason that you provided on the 18th of September is new J cannot s commissioner new J cannot sit through these interviews yes because he would be biased or he's going to risk of being buyers because they support a candidate not that not what you're giving us now uh commissioner this the statement you you when when you look at that letter that you have quoted now it cannot be looked in isolation one must examine the statement the statement called for an alternative candidate because the division is in disarray and and and if that is a starting point that is my main problem because a an alternative candidate uh in my view the motivation for alternative candidate say the division is in that is an incorrect assumption and someone who's going to sit uh on this body is going to sit with that pre preconceived notion that division is in and that is why an alternative candidate must be supported and that is not something I can uh contest if that is already a preconceived view that someone holds in the appointment of an alternate candidate so it was more by the content of the statement and the the the the the idea that the division is in Israel which would then justify the appointment of an all I was doing a was to put the reason that you gave us when we decided uh your your objection or your request for recusal this is the reason you had given us and that's the B the reason on which we decided that is in order I I accept that because the statement was annexed and the commission is fully Alive to the content of that statement I will accept that thank you CJ uh now can we get to the second part of Mr bov's Question yeah um Mr BOS sorry sorry a CJ can I just correct that the the first case I discussed Wasing trading I think I said construction trading uh the Met of panga was raised at the previous interview involved the postponement um yes I have heard in that case I have conceded uh that I've learned uh my lesson in that case to the extent that postponements should not easily be granted um so um I think I've dealt with that matter in a previous interview when I was asked what did I learn um it was a matrimonial dispute and of course one party was ready and felt the other party was using delaying tactics and I sat with a colleague and we then uh were were of the view that a postponement should have been granted because the legal representative representative was uh had commitments in a higher court and that was the reason why the one party wasn't represented so I con see that um my colleague and I uh in that judgment uh the other judgment Pon construction uh I've I take note of the that judgment and the comments that were made uh in that judgment uh Commissioners I'm 19 years a judge and my uh Bill record is very sound and I'm saying this with regard to concerns raised by the commissioner with regard to uh my intellectual capacity uh to be an example to other judges I think my record speaks for itself 19 years as a judge uh what is it 10 matters that's been overturned it's not e e I would say I think my mind was clouded by the fact that it was 19 that the business was happening as a result of that I mean against the background of a wealth manager uh who had a fight with a businessman uh which resulted in in in the businesses sing multiple businesses um I I accept that my Approach was wrong in that matter it C I just actually follow up on my question okay I'll be quick to be fair if you on reading the sca decision I I have to take issue with your reference to covid-19 as on two points firstly judges have to make difficult decisions and cannot let emotion or personal views of the mure in which those decisions are been taken Cloud their application of the law but furthermore I take issue with your Reliance on covid-19 because it appears that rather what you actually relied on was an apparent flaud regarding the sale transaction in in pursuit or in Perfection of the settlement agreement in order to discharge the provisional um um the provisional orders and and the SE specifically said that happened after the consent order this supposed fraud and and should not have even come into play or even have factored into your decision to reopen the question something that frankly had been had been it's essentially you've decided on it so so I take issue with with with your defense of what you had done noting that you admit that you were wrong and and and and just finally if we were to take issue with every judge that has been taken on appeal and and appeal has been or overturned on appeal we'd be wasting our time the point is and this is comes from the threat that we've now spend hours on it appears that you sometimes or you have a lack of and now in management and now also when sitting as a judge there's a tendency of rash judgment and I'm not only one Jud only a of decisioning on the basis of number many absolutely CJ but my point is the manner in which the Supreme Court of Appeal interacted with it and and and assessed it and by the candidate's own explanation of why what was done I'm I'm I'm staging that explanation something else no no sorry then I stated it I retracted that my point is being and I suppose after then let me not repeat myself I've stated that you can't let other factors Cloud your decision when it comes to Pure application of the law because that's what people can have to rely on thank you very much commissioner uh the commissioner also mentioned about a fraudulent uh transaction that was also involved in this matter and that is a fact that I did consider in uh assisting rather uh granting order for business rescue so there are lots of uh issues involving in that matter uh and I didn't just look purely on the law besides the fact that it was Co there was fraudulent transaction there was a fight with a wealth manager I do understand and I ConEd when you look at it from a legal I have heard the commission heard now that they were also fraud involved which then motivated me to look at the matter through a different lens and arrived at the conclusion that I did but I accept that on the law the Judgment uh is fled you know I've been listening to you when you started you said you have an open door policy theion is well every of your own comment made about and also about trying to get wanting to get otheres from accusing themselves and formulating your own I mean how can you convince me that and you said you are a communication specialist that's what you said but from what I this you let communication you let communication you can't even communicate your own you can't even trust the same that do want everybody to so Hower how do you expect me to say this is the commissioner there was only one application forus that I made so from my vantage point uh it only involved that the president of mad it is take a procedure based on that statement which I explain the content of the statement that I had concerns about um with regard to the designation itself I exercise a constitutional power but I've noted the commission's concern that I made that change because the commission expressed The View that I should have let the person be the shortest to to to represent theion I have I have doubt with that that I was a weighed up up a judge who who who was close to very close to one of the candidates Visa a judge who on his way out and has no ties not with me with none of the candidates uh we're not close we don't socialize nothing the judge is on his way out the judge acted in the Constitutional Court an experienced judge um but I've noted uh the comments with regard to communication I do have an open door policy any judge who has a problem can come and speak to me about it and they do that is exactly what they do I have one instance where a judge raised uh certain issues uh here at the JC and I've dealt with this I've I've dealt with these issues uh that were raised um and I accept that that that there is room for improvement I will accept that commissioner St thank you CJ uh good uh good morning good morning acting JP I want to go back to the Standard Bank judgment yes because I think it's it's very important to characterize what you got wrong here it's important because candidates should not be afraid to come here because their judgments have been overturned on appeal High Court judges work under such enormous pressure and to get those judgments out is very important to get them out quickly and if they get them wrong well that's what the appeal court is there for and they are usually arguable points of law in most cases of any complexity and it would be wrong to characterize H how the the sca overturned your judgment on that basis and and why this judgment has been singled out it's not a run-ofthe-mill overturning of appeal the the court says you made two fundamental errors you granted an order where there was no application before you there was a non-existent application you granted an order and at the same time you ignored an existing order of court now those are those are primary and fundamental errors they're not they're not arguable points um so in in answering the question this is this is not about other judgments you might have got right or errors that judges made this is such a fundamental and serious error that you know the court says the high court must be regretted regrettably be deated in the strongest possible terms it's an exceptional situation um and I want I wanted to make that clear thank you very much C CJ before the candidate answers can I please follow up on that point the question I wanted to to raise okay uh so that we can save time uh good good morning Deputy judge president I think um commissioner stanberg is raising an important point because what Thea was dealing with there was a settlement agreement where multiple orders were granted one of the orders that were granted was to withdraw the business rescue application the other one was to postpone the liquidation application so at the later stage there was an answering of that was put up and the matter was argued at a later date then what the sca is saying when you had the matter you did not take into account the fact that there was a settlement agreement where the business rescue application was actually with draw but you proceeded to Grant a business rescue application that is the application that the court is saying it was not before the court and I think that is where the fundamental challenge is thank you very much CJ a yeah Commissioners uh I've noted the comments made uh I have heard in that uh judgment um from my vantage point the business rescue application was revived after the fraudulent agreement but I accept the sca's uh comments uh or ruling that uh the application was non-existent because I approached it as a fresh uh application but I've noted the comments and I accept that I have heard uh in that regard yeah um Commissioners I'm going to urge you to please think carefully before you raise your hand we've been interviewing this candidate for almost 3 hours now uh do you still want to put your question Mr son you you were the first person to raise a to raise your hand I I was in fact but I think in the interest of time a number of issues have been covered thank you commissioner JP um good morning once again ajp good morning JP um I'm surprised sure changing yourself regarding the initiative you've taken as ajp for your court to be digitized um I think you should have mentioned that more strongly you even sent a team to go and observe judges and Court staff am I correct that's correct uh JP I'm passionate about improving the efficiency of the Courts and digitization and Innovation is close to my heart so um the the court is fully trained yeah uh to we are we are out of our starting blocks and we are expanding the training in Cape Town we working on our practice directives you've mentioned that the Western cap high court is drowning in paper so it's very much needed and yes I'm am passionate about uh that project I just want to explore two things with you quick and you don't have to be U to give a very long explanation about each in the interest of time one is you've mentioned several times that the 80% of the judges are doing criminal work or we doing criminal work and 20% um doing the other work but I'm not sure if I heard what your vision is because from where I sit there's always a certain number of Judges that do the criminal roles and then there are the other judges do all the other work areas um I I don't think I've heard you what your vision is as to ensuring that there's a an equitable spread of judicial resources that attend to the work that come to the court are you able to to to to give that clarification what's your vision about correcting that well obviously my vision is for the Western cap high court to be a United bench to be accessible to all and to be a leader and efficient effective and expedient Service delivery uh but through the means of digitization which will then streamline processes and make the court more efficient and can can I stop you there I'm talking I'm talking about this issue of 80% in crime and 20 uh normally we would allocate criminal matters to 12 or 13 judges we' only that is our normal formula uh commissioner uh but because of the backlog uh we have many matters uh that is parted uh that needs to be completed so even if you take a judge you can take a judge out of crime only once they have completed uh the the the the the full year uh the the the Western cap division is in a unique situation that most of its matters involve uh multiple accused so the trials do tend to take long um so my strategy was to finalize backlog to finalize parts and during that phase 80% of the judges were in crime we also have ad hog judges coming in to finish the crime and that is why I had to introduce the prono project to assist uh with with a civil load so what the strategy is is to get more judges in the Civil pool but as we stand currently we have 33 parted uh matters that is of which 14 is in sentencing stage so there idea is to have only 13 judges in crime and the rest in the Civil pool while we are finalizing we're at the tail end of working away uh the old criminal matters we're at the tail end of that uh we have2 matters on our pre-trial Ro so it's a matter of balancing how many new matters are going to start in consultation with the NPA so that we can go back to our normal figure of only 13 judges in crime so what can happen is that you have 13 judges in crime and then you have judges who are partial civil and partial crime as I've mentioned some of the cases are in sentencing stage waiting for reports uh probation office reports or any other outstanding uh issues um so J in terms of going forward the Civil matter are being attended to by virtue of the special Friday roles that I've introduced so that the Civil worklow does not suffer the r matters are being managed and mediated which creates slots for civil matters to be brought forward to be finalized so I am dealing with the fact that there are more criminal matters running I'm dealing with the Civil matters in that way okay and in so doing that concern that there's not sufficient manpower to attend to civil matters uh is no longer there I've balanced that out with the pro bono project and the Friday project and the ref project okay thank you very much for that I I don't agree with you by the way when you say the running roll method won't help you the continuous role yes continuous role yeah yeah continuous role is an advantage uh JP because if you can focus on one matter and let it run through it is fine but what happened with these parted matters it the sometimes the judges get stuck in the middle of the matter because the council is involved in more than one matter and Council must then then first be in one court and then in the other court and I'm specifically referring to Legal Aid Council here so sometimes a matter must stand down while the legal a officer completes another matter so there was there's this peace Mill finalized ation that then uh destabilize The Continuous role and that is what we are busy working away now so that we can actually go back to a continuous role uh that is the ideal uh JP okay um one my last question CJ um one of the issues raised by uh judge Ali is your allocation patterns yes yes and the point she makes is you allocate more complex work to acting judges instead of allocating work to permanent judges um I've come across one case you you sat in a scalabrini home Affairs matter some years ago and there's another one that was decided in August I think this year by an acting Jud Jud it's a a matter that involved issues that have already been decided by the Constitutional Court um by acting judge man is it man if I may yes pronounce it and I asked myself this was not an easy matter because it had to do with declaring certain legislation unconstitutional and uh it es on matters that have been dealt with by the conc and some of them by a full court in couting so I ask myself how was this matter allocated to that acting judge and to be fair to you I look at your lineup of people who want to be judges in the Western Cape this person is not there and I don't know how many times she acted in your division to get the not to deal with that matter so I'm raising it in the context of what judge Ali says are you able to to deal with that do you know the matter yes yes I'm aware of that uh JP allocations in the division it's purely done based on availability and the Western Cape division is a very busy uh division so the judges specifically in the Civil pool they are very busy and sometimes you get matters that should then be allocated as an early allocation and this is that was one of those matters uh it was an early allocation and um it's it's a lot of reading so the the because the judges are so busy in the Civil pool what happens is dates were allocated to that specific matter remember I don't allocate the dates so when the file comes up for allocation I can only look at my register to see who is available to hear that matter and if someone outside the division if a acting judge or a pro boner judge is given that matter it means that no one was available in the division to do that matter because that is the F that is the starting point is to get if you know it's a high impact matter is to look for a judge within the division um so sometimes these early allocations also come up a bit late for allocation it must come up at least at least 10 days that would be two weeks uh it's it's uh two weeks which means 5 days of the week plus the previous week five days so it comes up 10 days before the time and uh that is the time when you would actually assess the availability of judges and uh but the but the recipe is uh first see who who are who is available inside the division before you would allocate it to someone else it's only if there's no one available inside that it would go to an acting judge I see outside um that tells me that there's no gatekeeping role that the leadership of the division plays when it comes to these complex matters because you would jealously get the Juris Prudence coming out of your court and you would not simply allocate uh to anyone I I do that with my DJ PS and we allocate 3 months in advance and we know how to allocate those matters so it sounds like in the Western Cape it's based on availability am I correct that's what your that's your answer that that that is a main consideration yes uh what one can do is change the date ask the parties maybe to shift the date so that you can then allocate it to someone in the division okay thank you thank you very much I've got no further questions thank you very much commissioner H thank you uh I've actually think that there is a matter that wasn't covered in some of the questions that were already post um ajp I'm over here commissioner Hassan uh thank you I I just want to ask maybe related to some of the elements around Unity um I think there is some perceptions that in the Western Cape division there are camps and I I say perception to be fair so I'm very interested um ajp um in this process of building Division and of course creating stability and I and I'm going to ask a difficult question should you be unsuccessful today ajp would you be able to support and help build that Unity with a different candidate at the Helm of the Western Cape division because we've heard numbers of things of not visiting different chambers the t- room you know there's a lot of rumors I'll say it like that a lot of rumors um that are are are Rife around the disunity there so I'm very interested um ajp what you would do uh should you not be appointed at the helm of this court thank you Commissioners I am the constitutionally appointed Deputy judge president and my role as the deputy judge president is to support uh the judge president and that is exactly what I intend to do uh that would then be my mandate um and when it comes to the appointment of someone else uh of course I need to be differential and people have different leadership styles uh so I will then navigate my way around that and just provide the support as my my current position dictates uh thank you Jud judge uh good morning judge good morning um my question just relates to what JP malambo was saying and in your interview in the beginning you said that um you have established but also sit on many committees within the division and I was wondering um does this together with the burdensome job of managing a division allow you to also sit on complex matters well initially when I I I I managed the division on my own the first term and I did quite a bit of Court work during that term uh but later on uh as the time progressed uh the administrative burden due to the administrative burden I had to reduce the time I spent in court but yes as a leader you do have time you can um prepare your diary accordingly and do sit in uh certain matters I think that slap the slap judgment that I did uh I think I was in my position already when I heard the slap matter I heard matters on trademarks while I was ajp um so and of course I I fulfill some role in mediating Family Matters before it gets allocated I mediate all Family Matters and matters involving children so yes I do have time for judicial work but it needs to be in a structured way because at the end of the day you also need to do some Court work uh to sharpen your skills and as a leader you also need to set an example and do go to court in certain matters thank you president M yes thank you very much and a ajp just a follow-up question um you said you managed the division on your own upon assuming your duties for the first time as ajp you you managed the division on your own did I understand you correctly in other words there was nobody acting as adjp that's correct what motivated that decision if I may ask uh bearing in mind um that you took over at the most difficult time and one would have imagined that you would have a lot of administrative responsibilities um did you not consider that it would maybe be wise to also have somebody body helping you um president Mela they were always senior judges uh and still they were and is senior judges that you can always approach to assist you whether it's with the ra court or with criminal uh criminal matters Etc my strategy the first um was just to to to uh to run the division on my own and do a wellness check and put certain things in place and and and and and bring things together and then appoint in during that term I then um identified someone uh to to to act as the deputy um for me my strategy was because I was the djp um and uh I knew more or less how the division functioned I could make strategic decisions quickly without having to consult someone at that time just to put the system in place and make sure uh that uh the most important things are done that needed to be done and during that term I then um had discussions with uh different judges uh to make an assessment of who has the necessary uh skills to assist me in the running of the division thank you C thank you president uh commissioner M uh thank you chief justice um I've got I've got two questions for you um um AGP one is just an invitation for your comment um when when judge gamble um interacted with you um regarding acting judges you said something to the effect that uh you are um unable to find capable black acting judges what did you mean by that no I in Cape Town in in Cape Town thanks for the qualification no I indicated that I I look outside of the province as well that's what I said I look outside of the province um we have uh black acting judges uh from Cape Town uh that is generic black we have uh if not all of them are from Cape Town except for three African uh women specifically I'm referring to women uh that I invited from outside of the province so there are generic black acting judges I just made the point that I don't limit it to Cape Town only that I do go outside because in Cape Town there's a lack of African female acting judges that is a problem we do have but it's just one or two African females and in in Your Vision that you outlined I I did not hear you um outlining in in detail what plans you have to to bring in um more capable black acting judges well I have started that process by looking Beyond The Province uh during my reign 29 women acted in the division uh the division is fully transformed in terms of uh gender but not in terms of race um and I think there is a need to appoint more African women on the bench um I have embarked on a pro program to to to appoint more black women which I did I think last time we had more more female or women or African acting judges than in any other group so that is work in progress and those judges are currently in in training um in the the total of 29 women that I had I see eight were black uh eight whites seven colored and about five Indian of the 29 I have mechanisms in place I deal with the structures I am encouraging African women to make themselves available I think that is the group where where the Western Cape can improve in terms of the diversity pool so I'm actively pursuing that agenda and actively approaching African women which I did thank you my my last question ajp um by my calculations and you'll tell me if I'm correct you said you were appointed djp on the in 2016 that's good and um that makes it 8 years and the last of this 8 years the last two years of this 8 years you were the ajp that's correct um in this eight years that you were the djp where you were required to work with the then JP obviously under what you call difficult period did you get an indication that you've got the support of your colleagues on the in in in your work as a djp because if that was the case why why would when an opening comes so many of them Avail themselves to do what you should have done in 8 years I think that is the aftermath of uh the issues uh that uh of in the tensions obviously I'm not entitled to the position of uh judge president in the division and I think anyone anyone else is free to make themselves available um as djp I had a cordial relationship initially with the judge president I did receive the support of uh all the judges in the division but when the problems arose um it is so that that that that it created uh division u in the in the in the division in terms of split uh little groups uh my task over the past two years was to try and overcome that bridge and that's why I introduced the t- room and regular meetings Etc uh I tried to normalize the functioning of the division by committees being active and the t- room fully functional meetings held regularly interaction between judges yes more can be done I'm not saying it's a perfect situation but as djp I did get the support uh of of of the judges in the division I think it is normal in the aftermath of uh the this the situation between myself and the judge president uh that um that there would be challenges uh to navigate and for the past two years that was my goal to navigate those challenges and build Bridges uh and um improve where I can uh and and try and uh create an environment that is conducive to collegiality which there is currently uh the fact that many judges make themselves available I think it is their right to do so uh no one is entitled to the to to that position and um that that is just the reality of the matter uh that does not mean uh that I didn't perform my functions as the deputy or as the ajp as ajp I was a caretaker and I'm satisfied uh that uh in my position as caraker have stabilized the division and going forward uh this commission will then decide who is going to take the division forward and it most certainly can be any of the eight candidates who are all entitled to make themselves available thank you Justice Professor thank you very much chief justice uh good afternoon again afternoon judge K and I think it it is really important um not withstanding the discussion that we had on that Supreme Court of Appeal case um to to state that you are actually a very good judge uh forensically uh we I think that must come out very clearly and you have P some of the most important judgments especially when you are in the Constitutional Court the raahu judgment uh the veterinary medicine judgment and the others you you you have actually done very well and I think that should come out very clearly and again there is one judgment I want to take you to page 31 of your of your of your document uh there's a judgment that you that you penned which is one of the beautiful judgments that you that you did um that deals with with trademark law you um you may you done that quite a long time ago in 2015 and and and that judgment is one of those that really um tried to to illustrate the differences between trademark infringement on the one right and the law relating to passing off on on on the other and and and I think you you did very well on it there is something that comes out though from from the Judgment I know it was long time ago I'm not going to bore you with the with the details but I just want to ask you a general question in relation to to trademarks generally and section 34 of the trademarks act which you you deal with quite competently in the in the Judgment um when I read the Judgment I got a sense that c can one say that the fact that the proprietor of a registered trademark fails to demonstrate significant consumer recognition be a defense to a trademark infringement claim um because in the Judgment when you are dealing with Section 334 you you quite correctly sure why the the the person who's claiming trademark uh infringement should not succeed when you are comparing the two marks uh but I'm just just curious to know that if you fail as a person who says look this is my trademark um and it has been infringed if I fail to demonstrate that there is this General recognition by by the public can that be a sufficient defense to a claim of trademark infringement and I don't know the answer I'm just asking you know look I've written a number of judgments on trade marks but um if someone can't uh show that uh its business is a social iated with a trademark it can become challenging to actually stake its claim uh if it if it did not uh if if it did not um use that trademark and then that that business is must be Associated through use of the trademark it can become challenging I don't think it means that that that that you cannot lay claim to the trademark because there may be other factors involved that that may allow you to claim the registration of the trademark as your own because it could have uh it could have been used uh for some time and then it was lying dormant and then you want to revive it and then someone wants to come and say but your business is no longer recognized through use of this trademark yeah I think there's no probably definite definitive question but it will just make it more difficult to show that your business is associated with it but it does not necessary mean that you're going to fail to protect the mark thank you very much um acting judge president thank you CJ thank you Prof um commissioner mam your hand was once up I don't know if you still want to put your question there a that's a quick one CJ I always hear this cels here every time a decision is made they say it has to meet the rationality test what is your understanding of a rationality test um when you exercise Public Power you must exercise Public Power in a rational way in other words if it's say uh the legislature or the executive or any public official if they exercise power and make decisions it must pass the rationality threshold because all Public Power is subject to constitutional control and the rationality threshold is very low uh to meet so for example say socio economic rights uh that's at stake and uh a department is uh being sued for not providing suff sufficiently enough service the Judiciary cannot interfere with polycentric decisions that's made uh by the other arms of State uh and why I'm saying that is if the reason for a policy or a decision meets the rationality test that is sufficient and the threshold is quite low because all decisions uh that are made must be there must be a rational connection between the decision made and the purpose for which a provision was enacted so in exercising Public Power where as acting JP you have the right to appoint or designate in exercising that power that's great you look at the reasons and say it's a friend of so and so is that a rationality does that reasoning meet the rationality test which is the lowest I'm happy that you are saying the rationality test is very law law as it is do you think the reason of the in the exercise of Public Power to choose a designate you say no this one is a friend of so and so does that meet a rationality test well the rationality threshold is low um it is so that someone else may feel that my reasoning uh uh is not uh does not meet the rationality test but the threshold is low um and someone else may say that uh I would have exercised my discretion differently but the fact that someone says I am inclined not to agree I I would actually have exercised my discretion differently it's not sufficient reason to say that someone else's reason uh is totally irrational ajp I'm not asking you about someone's decision I'm asking you about your decision does it meet a rationality test because I'm going to argue that you your your your reasoning does not meet a rationality test and as a judge who's supposed to be objective you must answer from that platform from an objective point of view and be honest with this panel after the engagements we have had with you in all honesty not whether someone else will say it meets the the lowest expectation or not in all honesty after the exercise we have gone with you for almost 4 hours now do you think that decision meets a rationality test which you must meet when you exercise a public power the reason why in the exercising of the Public Power ER you have to meet the rationality test is to avoid abuse of that Public Power because what you did is an abuse of that power because it doesn't meet the rationality test but in your own standard as an as a leader as an aspirant judge president do you think on a hindsight now that decision you took based on friendship of people does does it meet the rationality test uh commissioner the the issue is not necessarily about the reality is also about perception so it is so that uh from from a certain perspective uh it's uh one may believe that it it does not meet the rationality threshold because the mere connection to a friend as one of the candidates may be viewed as insufficient reason to designate a different alternative please I I think we have been long here all I'm asking is does her decision after all of that made a rationality test what she explaining she said it before we have heard that we just want to know if she says it's yes or no that's the answer but I need I must not go and second guess her in the deliberations uh commissioner I I'm trying to explain that the fact that someone is closely connected to a friend of one of the candidates may not meet the r rationality threshold in certain quarters I I can understand that my from my perspective in designating an alternate I looked at the matter clinically and said what would be the best option A designate who has absolutely no ties with any of the candidates including myself or someone who is connected to one of the candidates by virtue of friendship and I then took the decision that for the it's in the interest of today's proceedings to have someone who is completely disconnected to all the candidates and that was my motivation and um um commissioner MMA um I I hear you that you want a yes or a no answer I I I hear you on that but I need to explain to the commission that I was sit with two options and from where I said I made the most rational decision to to choose someone who has no connection with all the candidates therefore it Miss a rationality test excuse me therefore it Miss a rationality test because you made a rational decision that's what you're saying I'm not a lawyer you must simplify it for me yes it me your decision meant the rationality test uh in your corner yes the threshold for the rationality test is is very low someone else may feel that the person who is connected to one candidate May indeed be suitable but someone else as someone in my position felt I would prefer someone who is not connected at all to any of the candidates and that would for me be a more rational decision simply because a designate who is not connected to anyone will be able to fulfill their function better because it's not only about reality it's also about perception I give I give up CG that is the answer commissioner that's why I'm saying I give up very last question Commissioners commissioner CJ thank you so much very quickly uh good afternoon AGP AGP just to check with you who appointed judge gamble as the the the AGP today for today um I I uh designated him on the 8th of August this year I designated I did the designation it was yourself that's right did you do it in consultation with the Chief Justice no I didn't do that in consultation with the Chief Justice the short listing uh involved the former Chief Justice not the designation the the Cent logic that you Advanced on the matter of no J and and judge erasmas does it not apply in the case of U judge gamble who must be designated by you to come and and um participate in an interview where you are a candidate no it does not apply thank you so much uh because the the in the first instance uh section 178k grants that power to designate and I have uh exercised that power in a manner where I thought it would be best if someone represents the division who has no ties with any of the candidates on the list not even with me absolutely no ties uh uh judge Erasmus was designated uh to do attend to short listing by the Chief Justice and when the short listing came out and I saw that there's someone's name there that's closely linked to judge arasmus I then elected to exercise my constitutional power in a manner where someone who is completely neutral to all the candidates are appointed and someone who has no connection with any of the candidates at all it's not my choice I I'm not a friend of Judge Gamble and he's due to retire in November there's no connection between us commissioner hands still keep coming up and uh I've been very inconsiderate with this candidate is it's chasing uh 4 hours now she has not even taken a break we've been walking in and out relieving ourselves getting coffees while she's been sitting there answering all these hot questions I just want to say this for the last time please think very carefully if you want to you really want to answer to if your question will take this process any further maybe put it that way do you insist Mr bov all right thank you thank you very much uh acting judge uh president thank much thank you very much to all the Commissioners thank you you're excuse all right 12 1236 is is the time lunch is at 1 we still have six candidates how do you want to do this press ah take a short Comfort break take one candidate then take lunch yeah what CJ we take CJ sorry I suggest we take lunch and then come it's not ready that's it will be ready at G one okay let's take a comfort break quickly and come back and just start with the next candidate okay 10 minutes yeah that's a record it's a record I'm sure e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e think judge president has given me specific functions and that is to deal with the Criminal Division and also to deal with all matters falling under that division namely petitions that come to the court in terms of section 309 c where I will then allocate these petitions to the different judges I will also allocate uh criminal matters uh to the judges I'll deal with the circuit courts um and I also deal with uh surrogacy matters and any other matter which see deems fit to send to me for um management whether it be litigant or practitioners that seek directors um from the office of the judge president I will deal with that and I take it you have enjoyed the experience because here you are in front of us well it was uh um interesting and um also hard work but yes yes here I am okay I assuming that you have a vision uh for the court what you'd like to change improve or you know I don't know what you have in mind for the court would you just take us through what's what's in your mind at at night when you think about your day and how the future should uh look for that Court chief justice and Commissioners have been at that court now for almost 19 years beginning as a junior judge then as a senior judge and now in a leadership position I am of the view that and I think the commission is well aware of the difficulties that we've gone through in that division my vision for the division is a short-term Vision a medium-term and also a longterm in the medium term is a period of starting off until about 6 to 12 months longterm is about from 12 months to 24 months and obviously a long-term Vision thereafter I've got about 8 and a half years left um before retirement and I would like to build a court that is stable I would like to see a court that deliver quality Justice and access to Justice and I would like to see a court that Embrace new technology I would also like to see a court that um do things a little bit different because in terms of approach and in terms of views obviously I've got a different approach and different views as the AGP and that is why I'm sitting here today with regard to my short-term vision is there is is no magic want in regard to build a division that had all these problems but one can at least start somewhere and somewhere where to start is to have an open debate amongst the colleagues within the division and I firmly believe that being there for so long has given me an insight into the division I know the division like the back of my hand I know the administrative side I know the um officials that work in that Division I know the um legal profession that practice there in the regular basis I interact with the various uh organized profession bodies on a regular basis so I've got a deep understanding and the complexity of the division and for for me one of the issues to do in the very short term is for instance to have a weekend away under the orices of shaj so that we as colleagues can have an interaction within a private environment confidential environment and have a one-on-one talk because I don't know if it was mentioned by the ajp previously but when when she started it was the first meetings that we had last year in about 6 years as judges we never had meetings before it just suddenly stopped so the issue is how can you run a division effectively if you don't have judges meetings but more importantly is to have not only judges meetings once a term but often as possible so that we can have debate raise because chares have always got different views and perceptions and we need to talk about it in that we can learn from one another of because we need to build the team we need to continuously build in terms of our collegiality in terms of how we see things and how we going to do it that's the first thing that I will do the second thing I will do is change the way we allocate our matters we still have an old system of manually allocating matters to judges and it's not as we don't have the capacity or the technology it's there so what we need to do to dispel this notion of there might be unfair allocations or somebody get more work than others or I saw somebody walking in the corridor not being in court The Simple Solution as far as I'm concerned is to have a program we go on one drive and a judge that wants to see what he or she has been allocated click on the laptop open up and can see what they've got for the day or for the next two weeks what judges A's got what judge y's got and so forth and so on those are the things that I will immediately introduce in terms of my um interaction with the judges I've got no controversy with any of my colleagues I've got an open door policy um in fact I'm sitting here to today because a number of colleagues Junior and senior has came to me beforeand and said please put up your name not only that I had the support staff coming and ask that I must put up my name I've also had as you can see from the nomination letters people from the legal practice or the organized profession to put it that way that said I must put up my name and I think that the the reason for that is as a result of my interaction and the respect that I've gained during this period of time on the bench not only from the organized profession but also from the public in general and also from my colleagues at large in terms of my medium plan our cour currently function with on paper so if you want to file a document you must file it at what we call room one our storage facility is limited we don't have sufficient storage facilities anymore for those files that's there so from that perspective what is the solution case on lines we have been uh introduced to it we've had our training and um judge president malambo was so kind to come out um one Friday and we were sitting from 2:00 until about 5:30 to train the judges as to how to use casel lines and that is the answer so we can go electronically the attorneys and the public can file it electronically it will assist on more than one level it will assist that we don't have to worry about files getting lost it will assist where parties blame one another for not filing timelessly because once a document is filed it's there it's up so that for me in the medium term that is from 6 to 18 24 months period that should be introduced within the Western Cape High Court and I will drive that particular process with regard to my long-term Vision our division currently relying on acting judges and I've supported the ajp with regard to compiling a list for candidates to be appointed as acting judges because we have got five vacancies currently and our establishment is 33 judges So currently we've got 28 judges of which one has been recently recommended the Supreme Court of Appeal we've got three judges that's going to retire within next 18 months collectively if you take into account the judges that already retired in the past 4 to 5 years those that are going to retire the next 18 months and those that have been elevated to a higher Court we have lost about 200 years of judicial experience we need to get judges permanent judges now with regard to the acting judges and this also impacts on the reserve judgments is you get those that has got no interest in permanent appointment that are only there to help and assist with backlog then you've got those acting judges that's not sure whether they've got the temperament of a judge I would like to experience a term or half a term to see whether they have it what it takes to be a judge and then those acting judges that tells you up front I would like to be become a judge therefore I would like to come an act so those are the scenarios that we've got and we've also got the prono system in place for me it is how do we go about appointing the acting judges and what are the criteria that we are using currently to get the people on board in terms of the transformation in terms of gender transformation and an overall perspective of getting people that can also do the work and in that instance I will if I do U Get appointed as a medium-term uh vision of mine is to get more input before appointing acting judges to have to go to in order to go to the judges the permanent judge say I've got a list I've got nine acting judges I need to appoint for next term here are the list of 15 people what's your input on that and from that discussion whether they want to talk in a meeting freely or whether they want to come and see me personally to say yes this person has appeared before me or that person has got an issue then I ultimately will make the final determination so from that perspective we have to look in terms of how we going to go about we can also not only limit the acting judges to Advocates or to attorneys or only to magistrates the Academia is there some of these um practitioners are professors they are expertise in the field and would like to come and act and we need to have that um in order to give them an opportunity and some of the CVS are there but they don't get appointed so those are the things that I will change and that's part of my vision and let me put it it's not it is practitioners of color they're not white but more importantly in terms of the long term my vision is we need more judges that's as simple as that our workload has increased tfold since I became a judge in 2007 but our Precinct is old and is very um compact if I can put it that so we need more courts a building has been in the past identified that process has stopped due to lack of funds so there was um previously mentioned that we will be able to um get two courts probably civil courts and that is a long-term plan in terms of funding but in terms of the Criminal Division as well our case load has quite doubled in the past five to six years we have sitting with people in prison awaiting trial for almost 2 to three years before they get a trial date I've visited in the past 18 months various prisons and I can tell this Commission that if you walk into one of those awaiting trial facilities they overcrowded you've got 40 50 60 people crowded in one facility with an open bathroom sitting there for a year two 3 years waiting for a trial date that cannot be so what I have done is there was this program before where we used um Courts at prisons and one particular court Paul Mo but there was some sort of objection from the practitioners and whoever the facility was not up to standard I took it upon myself took the stakeholders to um Paul Mo we had the commissioner he retired now with us I asked the um legal profession what is wrong with this why can't we not sit here and deal with matters and they were telling me that this bench is too short and we sitting on top of each other and the commissioner said stop what do you want us to do do you want us to lengthen it yes so how many uh Council can sit here from four we increase it to seven and that's been done pmore is running currently in the past um 12 months since I took over six matters has been finalized in p and these are not six ordinary matters they are six highly complicated and um high risk matters with regard to Goodwood prison that prison facility was not up yet I've pressed the Department of Correctional service then under the previous commissionary di to get the facility up and going it is now but we have got a problem in terms of the it infrastructure because the cabling is um too expensive and no one has got money for it so we are using our own mobile system currently six matters has been finalized in that court in the past uh 12 months so these are the things that I would like to drive and to see more of these facil because we need to finalize cases the turnaround of cases needs to increase this commission will probably know and I've got a report here from the NPA that essentially says that currently the Western Cape high court has got 13 highrisk matters the commission has probably read in the newspapers about it but when you see the Witnesses under witness protection it's one thing but when you see the investigating officer under protection and you see the prosecutors under protection it's something else and was the cases are running Witnesses are being taken out it's a worrying factor and we need to deal with it because if we don't do it effectively and efficiently the rule of law will be under attack and that is my vision that to get the division running smoothly and currently I can say to this um commission that from 97 I just get my figures right about two years ago we've now got about 110 matters on our row of that 110 34 are parted matters so there are some judges that's got more than one parted matter 14 of those matters are currently in sentencing stage so we will be under the 100 mark of criminal cases on our Ro and how did we do it I physically went to go count those cases because in order to manage it you must measure it because without that you don't know what you're doing with and dealing with I've also indicated to the judges because what we found is the acting judges not completing the cases and the criminal matters and then they postpone the cases to term so when we arrive after recess period we find that most of the courts are busy because this acting judge is doing criminal matter and that acting judge is doing a criminal matter I stop that I stop it I said no if you've got a parted matter as an acting judge CRI matter you do it in recess and if those judges permanent judges can finalize a criminal matter whether just to sentence or whether there's a probation officers report outstanding do it in recess and that is what I've done within the short space of time and I think that I'm confident that I've got the backing of the judges with me not one of them has raised any issue with me yet to say that they disagree with this or they don't agree with that in terms of the case flow mananagement of cases in terms of being a judge president obviously you must also have your pulse or your finger on the pulse in terms of the rest of the division what's happening in the lower courts what's happening in the organized profession and in that regard my interaction with the magistracy I understand the issues there I've been a magistrate the Regional Court president was the other day uh at a office and we discussed the issue of the Southern Cape Southern cape has got a problem in the Regional Court there are only five magistrate magistrates but there are about 4,000 cases outstanding we need more magistrates to work down that load so that is work in progress as the how we going to deal with that in this past 18 months I could not give sufficient attention to all what's happening in the lower courts because of what was required from me to work in our own division but I've understand the difficulties that they're facing infrastructure problem recording machines that's not working um and how that impact on the delay day of of cases so from where I'm sitting uh chief justice and Commissioners is we need to build the Western Cape we need strong leadership within the Western Cape and we need leadership that can understand the issues uh of the Western Cape and and I firmly believe that we can or I can turn it around with my experience and skill set the last thing that I would like to mention in terms of the bar because that always remain an issue we see that young black Junior Council coming in but after a few years they disappear the K Bar has got what they termin a program where from year 0 to 5 you will have senior counil clopping together in a pool and pay the expenses of the young Juniors but that's only from0 to 5 the difficulty is after five or seven years what happened then that is where the problem lies and often The Briefing patterns of the state needs to be looked at it cannot be that you still find today that the state breef and I'm saying with all due respect white males walking into your court without any Juniors or black Juniors why is it still happening the state attorney might have his own uh briefing patterns but I we need to relook at that and I think if that changes that we have a system where senior Council must have a young black Council female male then it will assist in the transformation of the judicary because I firmly believe believe a strong and ethical bench and attorney's profession brings about a strong unethical let me just rephrase that I just want to say a strong and ethical Advocates bar and a strong and ethical attorney's profession brings about a strong and ethical bench thank you chief justice thank you judge L you you mentioned uh as you were going through your plan that um it or aspects of it have the support of your colleagues yes chief justice does that include the acting chge president yes because what has happened is we've discussed it that and we have to open discussion in terms of how we should uh do things and um she is aware that we have different views and opinions on certain issues all right uh just to round off on on your CV you you've also acted in the competition courts yes but that didn't materialize as I would want it to be because what happened is that there were no cases and then I got appointed acting DGP then I phoned JP and said to him I think I'd rather concentrate on the work that was given to me and and that was the end of it all right um and whilst the magistrate you were the national executive president of joasa that's correct an association of of magistrates that's correct chief justice for a term I was for two years um it's a non renewable term of two years and uh um I can proudly say that we I and um the chair of the genter desk one of the magistrates discussed the agenda desk in the organization when I was president to promote the interest of uh the female magistracy because at that time in 2000 there was very few uh black female magistrates in leadership in fact I don't think there was um so we've worked on it and I can say that the first chair of that gender desk is now a senior member at the Supreme Court of Appeal all right that's something to be proud of okay uh judge gamble do you have do you have any questions for the candidate yes thank you chief justice uh judge lanji sitting where I am in the I suppose the departure Lounge um of judicial officer I'm I'm very encouraged by by your Visions um it's good to hear that that there's a plan in place I've got just three issues that I'd like to raise with you the first is the question of the criminal backlog and Commissioners this morning had questions uh for judge Goliath in that regard uh the backlog is extensive and you've you've spoken about bringing it down one of the problems as as I understand it is that effectively the judge president has no control over the amount of criminal matters coming in that's the prerogative of the DPP you get told that the following cases are on the role for the following term and please find us judges for it how do you address that problem well we did address it in the practice directive so what we said to the NPA is while the matter is still down in the lower court and before transferring it to the high court I want a practice note from the NPA to tell me exactly what's the nature of the case how many accused are involved um what's the complexity of in terms of the indictments that we're dealing with and the time period that they think is matter done so we we've changed our practice directives to um deal with that issue so before the NPA can transfer a matter I first see what it is because what is transpired in the past is the DPP just transfer matters to the high court to um what we call a pre-trial court and then you will see host of matters sitting there and we don't have the judges so before a matter gets transferred I know beforeand how long that matter is going to run how many state Witnesses they intend calling and how how many of the accused might call witnesses Etc so we can plan properly I mean can tell this commission there is now one case that still in the district court in the lower courts um highly complicated organized crime matter where it is alleged that the construction Mafia is involved and there's also an ex High um politician involved in that particular case we track that matter because when that matter comes to the high court that matter will be allocated to a person that can deal with it accordingly and have a quicker turn around time my second question relates to serving The Province our province is huge it runs from shendal in the North Cape Town B at West swell and dum and right up to platberg Bay in in the east as you know I'm a a keen one for circuits and I regularly do circuits because I I believe that's the way that you take justice into the community it does seem to me from from the way things are going that there is an ever increasing necessity for a local division to be established in in perhaps George or Mosel Bay probably George because George has a a bigger commercial center that would enable the the division to cover oin PL niser Mosel Bay riversdale even down to swellam and it would make it easier for civil DET to get to court in a place like that rather than in uh having to come to Cape Town have you have you any thoughts in that regard I know that the I think it was the MOSI um I'm just trying to think of the name that compiled a report with regard to um the court structure um so there is the suggestion that George be a a local division a permanent local division and I support that wholeheartedly um but once again these are budgetary constraints let me explain to the commission the following if because I'm dealing with circuits if you send a judge on a circuit you must determine the length of that circuit in terms of time period because it's not only the judge that's going it's the judge the secretary the ographer and The Interpreter because ocj function separate from doj so and then you must take into account the prosecution and the legal aid because all of them are coming from Cape Town sometimes and the cost involved because to put up all those people for a period of 4 months 5 months drains the budget so when that is happened for me it is what's the case that we're going to deal with and will that case be finalized so when a circuit is being declared by me I know that this case will be capable of being finalized within that period of time and I think that's is important factor when dealing with circuits we've got a a continuous civil circuit within George that's running um for a term two weeks the first portion of the term and 3 weeks the last portion of the term but once again it is the cost implications because our budget has been cut and there is just um a problem in that regard but we go out as as far as possible on circuits I myself as acting Deputy judge president has gone on circuits because I know for the fact this case will take two weeks and I finalized it within two weeks within my period as acting Deputy judge president I finalized about six cases in the last um months from the start of this year so I'm going to court and deal with it I've also in order to avoid this uh paper war that we're fighting one instance I was sound myself uh a matter a review matter and the paper was this eye and I found um Justice ML and said look it appears as these attorneys all are on your platform on casel lines um can I jump on your platform and his reply was well it's for all of us luckily a day before the matter had to be heard I was founded that uh the matter has been settled uh by the parties but that is the Innovation that we need to do in order to get things going the third is a remark perhaps in a lighter note because I know you have great difficulty with control over the building but if you do get the job could you please fix the toilets on the second floor that are used by judges thank you CJ thank you Josh kmo Mr POS thank you CJ and uh afternoon uh I ad G JP sounds bit silly but yes um just to brief questions um I think the one is a followup on on Judge Gamble's question regarding the circuits but there was a comment from one of the submitting bodies I think the national Bar Council um and I think I'll just repeat what they asked but but how you would or could potentially use technology in a similar way or the Innovation that you've shown with your criminal initiatives to potentially you know we're talking about circuits now far away but but there's a need for Access an easier access to Justice on our doorstep in the very poor communities around Cape Town kicha langa Alie every so is that is that possible and and I know budget and everything but you know being in government myself also you have to make do with an Ever constraining fiscal space but but that's that's uh that's no ointment to the wounds to people who are sitting there desperate for you know if if I if they have to decide between while the transport to court is going to you know be the difference between a meal tonight then you know that that's not not justice so I would just and then there's a short question after but I think I'll give you an opportunity first answer that I think we have to embrace um technology and use it to Advantage uh whilst we were discussing with the regional Court president some of the difficulties that c experienced one of the options was to instead of magistrate that had a parted matter in B but she was is appointed in fredenburg so they put up uh in front of a laptop there in fredenburg and then was hearing the matter the rest of the evidence in bville because he was working there uh in bville um during acting period and pick up now that's the Innovation so it safe cost and I fully agree that we must embrace it but it is um sometimes problematic because the speed of the Wi-Fi might be a problem then pictures get Frozen and everybody becomes um unnerved about it um so so it is those infrastructural problems that we facing but I fully agree with Mr B that we need to embrace uh technology and in so far in terms even postponements in in in prisons as far as I concerned and I'm not too sure how many have ever experience the capee town m 3 in the morning with all these Vans chasing down those stre is to have a postponement whilst those that we know we not going to deal with but what we do find now there is objection to that from the accused because they want to come to court they want to see some of the families but there's also other reasons why they want to be there um so those are issues that we are dealing with that we would like to um Engage The NPA with and as if I become or if I get recommended to judge president those are the innovations that I will drive to ensure that there are cost-saving measures in place in particular in that regard thank you judge um and then the second one is you would have you would have seen there was a an objection from a Miss Alish that was filed now I mean what I really just want to ask it seems it was somebody who appeared in person there was a an earlier appearance before ajp Goliath and the matter was at that point it was djp goath um I don't know I I don't know the details of it all it involved in eviction and Etc then this person appeared before you in court and in your response you filed the the the transcript of the proceedings and uh the person was unrepresented and I think um if I go by the transcript the proceedings lasted all of a minute um and you had dismissed the matter for lack of urgency and you advised that it's rather that they rather approach the mag cour to have it rescinded the order that they took issue with my question isn't so much about the matter but more about the perception that an unrepresented litigant appears before you and the transcript creates an impression of um a bit of a potentially I suppose without being unfair and and please understand it's a question I'm not making I'm not accusing um but it's it comes across as quite dismissive uh especially when somebody's unrepresented um so I would just like to hear your comments on that thank you Mr commissioner B firstly I've got no independent recollection of this particular matter um I asked my secretary to see if they can draw a file that period and when the file arrived um my response is accordingly that um ordinarily what would happen is that if there is um a person or litigant that appear in person and you're on urgent Duty you will get the file before and and go through it and then you go to court and deal with it accordingly so I cannot um it might come across as sort of dismissive but that's not my way of dealing with matters if that was my way of dealing matters commissioner BOS of I can tell you now advocate for Transformations would not have recommended me or supported me neither the three female senior councel would not have uh put their signatures to recom me that's not me thank you C thank you Mr B Mr uh commissioner Goda uh thank you CJ I was covered by Mr bosov in part about the remand detainees and um the use of AVR I was also recently at Poore um and I've seen exactly what you've seen and and I'm just interested and could you may just briefly expand on how you will work work with the lower courts and the Regional Court um to make use of those facilities in order to deal with the issue of Rand detes faster if recommended as judge president I will issue a directive in that regard in terms of the postponements how we can deal with it but before issuing the directive I will sit down with all the stakeholders and see how we can deal with it in a more efficient and effective way without transporting all of those people all the time but there's limitations to all of this and it's progress uh it will be over medium to longterm period to implement it but it is there and we need to use it that Court was never optimally used it was always there but since I took over it's now being optimally used it's every term there's a matter down um to be dealt with and my ADD is that one of the judges that's sitting there is one of the more experienced Regional Court mag magistrate in cesa female that's dealing effectively in that in that particular case uh in that particular court thank you and then just to confirm that in in Cape Town we have two types of blue light brigades the one being the one from BS yeah I'm could Mr thank you very much CJ good afternoon judge good afternoon commissioner um initially I wanted to to speak to you about your your judgment Musa versus Hana that was confirmed by the Constitutional court but you said something in your in your in your in Your Vision that really required me to to actually focus on those because I thought they were important the first issue that I want to to address you on or to ask you on um it is the issue of of which is part of your your vision that you want to interact with stakeholders to see how black lawyers can be made part of the system so that they can survive I think in most instances the issue of briefing and all the issues that we always talk about in terms of how other people get access to work it comes across as if we need to do black people a favor that they need to be made part of and we end up making the white person who's actually is being paired with a black person to look good like I I've done this for this person I've done that for that person and I have an issue with that what are the the more nuanced and strategic sort of suggestions do you have um should you be successful even if you don't become successful um that can actually assist within the context of the Western Cape to ensure that the people that you refer to as disenfranchised are actually being made part of the briefing patterns business changes its mind government changes its mind and when they are paired with white senior account they are actually relied on because it's about opportunity it's not necessarily about people being paid for their fees and all those it's about H getting opportunities and proving yourself so that people can realize that you are good at what you're do what what are the sort of um realizable sort of goals do you have or objectives that you you think can be achieved to to change this the the mindset in terms of changing the The Briefing patterns commissioner it's a very difficult question but one can do something about it as um judge president you have to have as I indicated earlier your finger on the pulse in terms of what's happening within the profession at large and one of the things that I'm currently doing is to get involved with training at the bar um I do mood Court during recess periods and particular for pupils that's at the bar but there is a it's a an issue that we need to talk about networking as well it's how do we that has been previously disenfranchised Network ourselves in terms of showing that we are capable of doing it because you cannot just sit and think that somebody's going to knock on your door at your Chambers and say sorry man are you doing X Y and Z come um appear for me we need that and we need to tell our young um practitioners that we need to get involved with the organizations we need to get involved and be more active in that regard so it's not a case of yes a white man I must not be paed with him and then transfer skills um but it is how do we also ourselves work the system in terms of showing up in terms of going out there and tell the people that I can do this I'm capable of doing it give me the opportunity and I think that is where the involvement of um BL Nadal advocates for transformation play such a fundamental role um in in that process I hope I've I've answered you yeah no no I I appreciate the answer um but there's issue of touting as well that might complicate the situation let me go to my to my to to my second question um should you be successful you will be leading a division that will obviously and invariably hear political disputes that often have the character of legal something and you have to to deal with with those and there is a sense um in in in in the country that um yes we talk about separation of powers and we try to explain it and we try to even teach it in in universities but it appears in in reality that there is some level of judicial activism in in South Africa which potentially can turn the country into a Jud eurocracy what is your view with regards to that commissioner remember Parliament sits within our um jurisdiction so obviously if there are disputes of parliament it flows over to us in the Western Cape division um with regard to that it is we don't ask for matters to come to the high court it is when there's a Fallout and a dispute then it ends up um at the high court but the the question in terms of um the Western Cape itself it it is this is the bench and we have to allocate these matters I I'll leave it there CJ because I raised the issue of judicial activism and jocy but I think I will I will leave with them thank you Pro commissioner Bren thank you chief justice um good afternoon good afternoon commissioner um if you are successful you're going to go back to a division that is in my view seriously fractured with many divisions and many many many problems uh why do you think you can heal those fractures in in that bench and and while you're answering that could you tell me what you think the most the one most important attribute of a Jud can I start with the last question first integrity that's our currency yeah I've noted it thanks without integrity that's the core of what Jud judgeship is all about honesty openness transparency a litigant walks into a court despite that you or she would accept that the person knows and understand the law to um resolve the dispute is to know that this person with Integrity would deal with my matter that is for me it's non-negotiable with regard to your first question commissioner um yes there are fences to be meant yes there are difference views and opinion but they also an enormous amount of Goodwill I've been in that division as you all know probably now for more than 17 years I've seen that division grow when I started it only had 27 judges it's got now 33 judges in fact it needs more but most of the judges apart from five were appointed after me if the judges that's going to leave soon the next 18 months I'll be in the top three in terms of years of experience I understand the complexities the Dynamics I understand the individual judges in terms of their personalities so from that perspective I will have a deep sense of what it is that might be the reason for whatever differences that might be and that is why I feel that we need to heal ourselves from inside so that we can can contextualize what has happened within that Division and have an honest and open and Frank talk which we never had we never had a session of sitting down and just talking to one another I think when Justice malumo was there that one Friday afternoon it was the first time where majority of Judges were together because Cas lines is so important and the laughter the bantering the it was so good to see that within that Division and environment and it can be happen it needs leadership to do it and that is what's the position the reason why we haven't done the talk yet because there was a view that in this transal period let let's wait for the judge president to be appointed so we can deal with this in that fashion commissioner J thank you very much uh chief justice good afternoon uh adjp good afternoon JP um one thing that makes a bench gel when I say gel is like function optimally is when it is collegate you understand what I'm trying to say when you have a collegate bench I see you're not responding oh sorry I'm I'm I'm watching you here so on the TV because you're so far away so I'm watching you on on the screen so I want to understand what you understand what I mean by a collegate bench my understanding of Kiki B B that um is collegial with one another that is understanding the issues and um understand what needs to be done unless I've got it wrong and they can work with each other yes of course am I understanding you to be saying that's not the case as we speak in the Western Cape uh judge president I tend to differ slightly colleagues are working together yes colleagues are dealing with matters as we sit here and colleagues are sitting in full bench appeals um in applications they are working together there might be colleagues that has got different views and approaches to certain things but as a division currently we are working and we are doing what is required on that score let me just go a bit further than that you must remember that the Fallout between two leaders affected us tremendously it didn't only affect us it also affected the support staff and we need to build on that whoever takes over as judge president need to understand what really transpired within that Division I for the first time when it was Secretary's Day last year said the secretaries we going to have a function for them there were some issues about there's no money whatever I said I don't care we're going to have a Secretary's Day because those are the people in the support stuff that also got affected by it we got a Secret's day we had a finger lunch we bought small little presents for them just to say thank you thank you for the support thank you for being there all the time and they really appreciated that gesture um coming from the judges so yes we are wor working together but you know there are always differences with judges you know some people support guys I don't want to make light of it but we banter with each other in terms of um who's winning and who's losing Etc but the serious differences in terms of what's there need to be unpacked because remember Commissioners names were mentioned within the complaints of judges and some of them feel offended about it some of them feel that you know why got I got dragged into this mess now what did I do wrong and we haven't talked about it yet so those are the core issues that we need to deal with okay so what what you're saying is that colleagues are working but uh more needs to be done to bring you together to be uh a bench that functions optimally that understands what it has to do you say I agree with that summary um JP okay thank you very much for that now my second question is you and a JP mentioned backlogs you know I get worried as head of Court when I hear that that a judges who carrying three sometimes more than that in terms of pads you worked in the Regional Court I don't know whether you've had occasion to chair a PE yes no no I have you I know what you're talking about you know what I'm talking about but the question is the reason the regional court has a problem is they don't have a continuous role system at any given point in time you find magistrates at some stage carrying something like 25 part heads one person yes now looks like the Western Cape division is going there no no no no no no that's what we had no let me explain that JP yeah before I arrived to deal with a Criminal Division there was a project that the previous judge president was dealing with criminal matters he got a few judges four or five of them together that only did criminal work so what will happen is that um the NPA will you start with a matter Apparently that is what I've been told and I stop that you start with a matter so when there's a delay or there somebody got sick or they can't continue with one matter they will bring another matter in like in the regional court because these judges are now going to just do criminal work all the time but the difficulty with that is the bulk of those four or five judges acting judges and when I arrived and I realized what was happening you know those matters were already there as parted matters so those are the things that I stopped and said it cannot continue like this you start a case and you finish a matter so that perception that we might go to the Regional Court not under my watch but we've got it now we've got it now it's it's old cases that's yeah am I understanding you to be saying you Embrace The Continuous rool yes no of course absolutely I see CJ can I ask one last question yes JP um we put some questions to the ajp and I'll put it to you because you part of the leadership as we speak and um this was raised in judge Ali's Mimo of uh allocation of sometimes of complex matters to acting judges I give the example of one matter very involved Refugee immigration related matter that was done by an acting judge and I ask myself how does that happen when there's a leadership that must check what's on the role and check who who must deal with it just president I've got um specific duties that was given to me by the acting judge president and um one of it I allocate two days of the week on a Monday and a Friday I go through the file before allocation and in fact it is not uncommon that I will phone The Judge first there is it happened I mean that certain U but not under my watch and we're not saying try to blame the ajp here I mean she might have had her own reasons but you must be understand that they are acting judges that's coming from the magistracy there are acting judges that comes from the attorney professor and they are acting judges that comes from the bar can can I stop you there I want to hear you tell me how you as a leadership or if you get the job how you you will address that I will address it immediately in terms of and you must screen the the the matters and also in terms of going online because you must be able to understand the strength of your bench and the way I will um change that is to do the allocations and I will be able to understand exactly what case is going where once we have our system up and going and it's a simple system it's a EXL spreadsheet all the judges names on with the dates you can see there is uh case X going to judge why when you pick it up you can't see but hang on you know this is an acting judge this is a rather weighty matter so those are the things that I will immediately Implement thank you CJ no further questions president M thank you very much good afternoon my brother adjp good afternoon uh um I think I must just preface my question by saying please don't take it in a pejorative sense I'm just trying to understand something because um my understanding is that H you have been adjp for over a year yes am I correct yes so you and ajp Goliath I assume have been working as a team yes yes and if you were working as a team you probably had a shared Vision about where you want to take the division with regard to the said Vision um you must remember that when we discuss issues there might be some different View and approach and as ajp she's got the final say so if I propose a particular route perhaps and there's a different view on it well a decision stands yes so so are you um suggesting that in relation to some of the things that you say where your initiative like um postponement of matters at corre ctional facilities and so forth the ones that you managed to get right she was amable and the ones that you say you are still going to do uh in respect of uh in respect of matters where she was not amable no no no no I'm not saying that yes what I'm saying is that this is ongoing in terms of um the the role and the backlog it is trying to to deal with it in a more efficient effective way because see left the Criminal Division in my hands and I dealt with it in that way I'm not saying that she didn't uh approve of it no or that's not her vision at all I hope I make myself clear I I hear you so the the flaws or the weaknesses that are in the system are there despite your interventions in relation to the criminal matters because you say she left them in your hand so so meaning what you are still to introduce is something that you could have introduced before because she left it in your hand president M the issue here is you must remember that we working with a whole range of factors it is not just a matter of implementation it is a matter of getting the stakeholders together with a period of time and we discussed the issue of um I think it's AVR um with the DPP but it is a Time factor and also a resource Factor there is the problems that's there is a holistic problem it's not a problem that saying you can Rectify it overnight or you can Rectify it within a month or so there are all sorts of role players that needs to be involved in that yes um my last question CJ with your permission uh I'm asking all of these questions in order to try and fairly assess or gauge whether you would be able to implement what you have set out in your in Your Vision um that's why I'm asking all these questions one item that you said is what you can do in the short term is in relation to allocations and I think when you elaborated on it you said so that um I'm paraphrasing now so that um allocations must be seen to be done fairly such that no one feels to be overworked and someone is seen walking around the passages as if they don't have work um so my question is why have you not been able to intervene in as far as that is concerned as part of the leadership as the person who has been part of the leadership for more than a year well that is where the different of approach and Views comes in excuse me sorry I get there that is where the different views come in and approach thank you cjk you thank you adjp I you know I'm sitting here listening to you judge L and uh I just get a I get a feeling it's just a feeling that you are ti toing around issues you're not coming out clearly being fully candid about what's going on and uh but uh I I'll leave it at that commissioner good afternoon CJ and Commissioners good afternoon I'm here sorry oh oh sorry I was just looking at I'm here uh thank you very much for your responses there's one issue that I would like you to clarify us on as at the present moment uh the ajp is the head of court and uh djp you are the assistant assuming you succeed becoming the head and she naturally refer to her position in view of what has been happening in that Prov Vision around the issue of unity and cohesion uh uh how is that going to happen um will that collegiality that we have been asked about before continue or to regress I just want you to comment around that issue that's the only question I have thank thank you commissioner um it is not a secret that the ajp will always say and she mentioned that in the t- room as well in front of other judges that I've got um calm demeanor in and a way of dealing with ISU on an even-handed Manner and she made it known that she will work with me um but over and above that you start to learn to know a person if you start working with him and I just want to address the point what the Chief Justice said I'm trying to tip toe around issues I'm not trying to tip toe if that is the impression then I would like to correct that in terms of the allocation it's a issue that has been raised but it's an issue that at that point in time the AGP feels uncomfortable to implement why sees the ajp and he made a decision on that because what's happened currently is this the secretaries come with a allocation note they give man they write on the piece of paper they say my judg is available on this and this this date these are the matters they take the secretary's note up to a pigeon ho then somebody collects it from there write it manually into um allocation list so then you will have a list where you have to allocate matters from so you look at dates um we've got a matter you sit with a matter here now it's for 2 weeks from now now you looking whose judge is now available two weeks from now to allocate the matter but we don't know what happened in intern period with a judge that's from a day or two ago the availability you see so in order to avoid that because now you allocate the matter the file goes down to the judge the judge phones up and say but listen here don't you know that I'm a I'm busy on such and such a date I can't deal with this matter now now how do you address that it's simple you put an Excel sheet you put it on computer there is the one drive system so when you do all your allocations within seconds somebody else can open up their laptops it's there they can see it so it will avoid all of this tension ion that might be there or the issue of preferential treat you're doing it again tension that might be there is there tension or is there no tension which is it I I I can actually feel your pain is you're trying to count your words and and it's so painful to listen to CJ what what I'm just saying is that obviously if I get a file and it appears that I'm busy then they is a sense that don't these people know what they're doing okay that's the point I would trying to say it's have you you are allocating matters me don't you know that I'm busy with another matter that is essentially what I'm trying to get across yes commission I I became confused um in the course of uh The Honorable Justice answering me he then uh uh to explain the tiptoeing and in my mind it was really tiptoeing around my question can I be clear to what I was asking go go ahead and put your answer your question again if need be I'm sorry for okay thank you chief justice uh judge I was asking you that assuming you are successful and uh your boss become your sub immediate subordinate that is acting judge president becoming R to her position as the djp of that province in view of what is publicly known and in view of the stance that I have no doubt you and her have taken uh to improve the unity and cohesion within that division um I was asking you will that not affect that if you now change the roles you become her her boss and she becomes your Junior as it were uh commissioner the answer to that is no because she indicated on more than one occasion that she is willing and prepared to work with me as djp thank you commissioner thank you chief justice uh good afternoon uh judge L good afternoon yes um look just to place it on the record that uh I've appeared before you several times and uh I've never got any sense that you don't know what you're doing um it's always been a pleasure but I've got a problem with the way you've answered the question around Mrs alus who was not represented I know that you say um Advocates have praised you in your manner in court I could join that list as well I think your manner in court is very good but I always when you read something like alus well is it because I'm an advocate how does he engage with the unrepresented now I've looked at the transcript of that hearing day it starts at 9:53 it's over by 9:54 and it starts by you saying uh are you the one who was evicted and then she says yes and then you say well I'm not going to deal with this matter I'm going to remove it she says well no but the magistrate didn't do proper job you say well let's go back to the Magistrate's court and do a decision uh and then she tries to speak again and then you interject and you say matter is removed now given the context of that case that it is an eviction case Cape Town is notorious for evicting of poor people from Housing section 26 is a constitutional andrin right it seems that the way you dealt with that case showed a level of impatience uh because she's not an advocate she's an unrepresented person and she's being roughed up by the traditional system so I do want to get a better answer from you because I don't think you get the the gist of the the concern um commission Kobi I fully understand um the question that you raised and if one look it coldly that impression might be created but as I indicated um to the Chief Justice and the commers before I've got no independent recollection of this particular case but that is not my style of working with unrepresented litigant and if that is the way I operate I can tell you now that there would have been a complaint about it if one and the reason why I refer to the um The Advocates is if you have regard to the Commings from the general Council of the ball um no no I don't have a problem with the TCB I I accept fully I've got a particular problem with the way you appear to have roughed up an unrepresented litigant on an eviction case about a home but as I said um on the cold facts it might have looked like that but that is not the way I deal with matters and I will accept your criticism on that then can we move on to another aspect which also I've got a problem with and I do need to to get some explanation on the the issue about your involvement in leadership uh about a year having been an acting Deputy jge president I understand all of that you've presented a vision that places you as an outsider but in reality you are an Insider there are four issues well there are many issues but let's pick four from Judge Ali that she she she is protesting about number one is the issue of the abandonment of the continuous role we asked uh the candidate before you the acting judge president she explained why she's not using the continuous role your answer is you want the continuous role to be used you support it number two judge Ali complains about arbitrary allocations where there is lack of transparency about why allocations are given to certain judges and not to other judges and which has also caused resentment because permanent judges are being overlooked for very serious and important cases in favor of acting judges number three minutes are not being kept so you end up not knowing what was decided uh the acting trust president has defended herself on that about why minutes were not being kept the matter coming all the way from 2010 and then number um uh four it's the lack of consultation and lack of joint decision making now we put put all of those to the acting judge president but I think that we should also put them to you because you are also the acting Deputy judge president you're not an outsider you an Insider if these are true for judge Goliath they must be true for you so could you just explain firstly whether you think the criticism by judge Ali is correct or fair and if you think it is fair why you have done nothing about it for more than a year with regard to um question one in terms of the abandonment of the continuous role there are Judges that's doing criminal matters that has been ongoing for some years in fact there's one matter that's going on for four years and the state has not even closed case that judge was an acting judge when he started with the matter he's now a permanent judge and he on more than one occasion came to me I'm not too sure if he went to the ajp but he came to me and said judge please I need some civil work so what I have done is when I allocate on a Friday and there's a civil matter because we allowed him to dealt with that matter because it's a matter that's going on from some time for the entire period because ordinary Fridays are appeal days if he can do on a Friday a civil matter so from that perspective there is then an interruption because the judge been sitting for so long just doing criminal work and he wants to get exposer with civil matters and he's a relatively young judge in terms of years of appointment so with regard to the abandonment of the um well let me put it the criticism from from um judge Ali if one have regard to that that was discussed in a meeting and I said to um the meeting there because of Judges that in that are in civil because listen when the one J that came to me and talk to me about it he says listen I'm been sitting in so long in a criminal matter I want to do a civil case that because of that we will allocate civil matters to the judges and it's not as if you break the entire continuous role it's an application a one day matter it's not like the person is now have to do a civil Thrive for four or five days and then the matter stands over and it does happen happen within criminal matter sometimes that the matter doesn't run for a variety of Reason somebody got sick witness doesn't pitch Etc and it's in that periods then that these matters can be heard so that is how I see it from that perspective in terms of the uh continuous role but we cannot function without a continuous I don't know what the ajp has told this commission but we need a continuous role as far as possible because you can ask any senior um judge or judge president it call chaos yes judge um you know the real issue I'm trying to get to it's very unusual for this body to receive an objection from a sitting judge against another judge it usually it's the attorneys it's the Advocates it's the clients but to get something from a judge that says this person is not fit to become a JP is a big thing so that's why I'm saying we we've been debating with the the person accused of all of these things but it occurs to me that we should not let you off the hook because you are an Insider and the reality is I'm trying to get to whether you think I mean so it must have taken something very seriously for judge Ali to come to the point where she's sounding an alarm to the whole country about the state of the division you are a leader in the division these things should have been raised internally or maybe were raised internally the real issue is why have you as the acting Deputy judge president forget about Judge goath her interview is over why have you not done anything to address the problems of one of your colleagues let me ask answer it this way this complaint I haven't seen it and I haven't seen what exactly judge Ali was Raising with um the ajp but I know for a fact that the issue of the continuous Ro was discussed in a meeting and that's how we dealt with it in fact it's during that same meeting that judge Ali was uh indicated that she's prepared to do a judgment writing seminar for an hour or two for the um acting judges and she did it I was present when she did uh did that um uh judgment writing um workshop with with the acting judges and minut that's not being kept the minutes that has been kept it's a it's it's a long issue that's coming on for some time um and the acps decided that minutes are not going to be kept and that she made a ruling on it and the arbitrary system of allocation where there's no transparent system as I indicated um to the commission at large if we introduce a computerized system that will fall away I understand that but I'm asking you to account why you've done nothing for a year because you've been in the leadership commission Kobi that is where the different approaches arises where you say fine look we need to change this we cannot continue using the system it's an old system no I get that and then the the last of the four complaints which is the lack of cohesion consultation collegiality working together in the division you say that's uh well let me not speak for you but give you a chance to uh explain yourself I want to say the the following and that is that's a process that we need to deal with deal with colleagues um go about their work we are dealing with um our work and there are interaction the cohesion that there is or the differences we must have more often meetings currently we only have one meeting a term that is no sort to to interrupt uh it's really about why you've done nothing about that issue since you were djp in terms of uh cohesion of getting the colleagues together yes the the plans you're outlining which I I must confess I agree with but if you are an Insider you must also account about the time you were there and you did nothing about the things you promising what I can say is that you have to understand that within the division we've had the occasion of um having a farewell for one of our colleagues that retired all of the judges attended that his retirement we had an occasion where um we thanked the acting judges that came at the end of the term the judges were there and we have our functions now and then and the judges attend to that is part of the process thank you chief justice I thank you chk there's a followup question commissioner thank you chief justice uh good afternoon judge L good afternoon commissioner uh judge there's been a common theme throughout your interview and I'm a bit conern concerned that you seem to be dodging the issue rather than deal with it head on so I want to give you a further opportunity probably your last opportunity just to deal with the elant in the room I think what we're trying to probe judge is the extent to which in Your Capacity as ajp you were able to exert influence in order to address all of the challenges that we've heard about throughout the course of the morning in terms of me addressing these issues is I have as I said uh previously The Fallout didn't only affected us as judges it also affected the staff and I've was firm about it let's get the secretaries together on secret Secretary Day with regard to getting um judges together we've got a functional tar room and we are having that and we trying to arrange or not try we did arrange um some get togethers now it's very difficult if judges say well I'm not going to come to the uh this function because you don't know what's the reason for that it might be he or she might be busy um there all sorts of other reasons with it but as judge president and I think this is where the commission must understand is that we did not have a talk and a discussion together so sorry please just clarify when you say we didn't have a talk together you're saying you and who no no as as a collective as judges sitting down and say look we need to move on and we need to address as you put it the elephant in the room what causes what is it that you might feel offended that I did or I say as judge lanzi or what is it that someone else might feel offended about and the commission might think I'm T towing around it but it's not it is a fact of and I think you the the commission must understand it's not just a matter of walking to a person's Cham and say listen why didn't you what's happening here uh why are you doing ABC or whatever the case may be I haven't seen you for a while why are you so quiet I chat to judges and I walk sometimes to their Chambers but it is not um the way to deal with it I think one of the what is the way to deal with it the the way to deal with it is to get together in a room like this and to talk about it because as I said CJ before The Fallout has caused and affected people differently and we need to debate and talk about it we canot just assume these things and judge what why hasn't that happened yet uh you're the adjp you're saying this is such a necessary event to take place why hasn't it happened because of the interim process because the reason why it's not being happened is there was a decision taken that wait for the JP to be appointed to deal with this you must remember also there was also the case pending from um the previous JP still in terms of challenging a lot of things in in higher courts okay uh commissioner you covered thank you thank you thank you thank you are you covered okay no you get your 10 thank you CJ yourself acting J deput president the site oh on your right the thank you thank you uh just uh uh two questions from my side the the first question is whether are Judges allowed to protest no because uh because of uh of your protest against the sitting sitting on an appeal matter uh which uh me ER put into question the issues around around your around the commitment around uh judicial temperment ER commitment to Public Service I think the first question that comes to my mind what are the impact of that protest action on uh on the affected parties uh and extend to wish to wish uh that protest action H delayed Justice uh to be to be discharged the the second one relates to to the point that you raised to say and repeatedly have said so uh that because of different views with the judge uh or the acting judge president this did not happen so the only question that I want to ask is upon your assumption of an acting position because I believe that you are the most fortunate one to have acted for for that period like now you are still acting meaning that there was confidence uh in you displayed by the acting judge president now in terms of Key Program areas obviously around strategic level in terms of moving the Western Cape divion forward emanating from the the qum that was facing do you want to tell me that we never had a strategic session with the acting judge president to isolate these issues and agree on on a common approach to say this is what we are taking to your fellow judges thank you chief justice thank you commissioner in terms of the first question the protest action I don't see it as a protest action in that sense I see it in a way of protecting litigant that appears before a court of law that expect judges to behave in a certain manner open transparent and with integrity and if one have regard to some of the case law although not on point it's quite clear that judges can decide not to sit with other judges but those circumstances are rare and this one is one of those rare circumstances the second issue in terms of strategy and um of the way forward the first thing that I said is that we must have judges meeting and I don't know if the AGP indicated that for the first period she acted on her own but but she wanted to show that she can run the division and that's her decision because ultimately see is the acting judge president now the strategy of how are we going to deal with the issues at hand as I indicated previously I'm not trying to tiptoe about it the decision was taken in terms of the inim phase of the leaders to postpone that until permanent JP has been appointed and that is it commissioner sorry who whose decision was it to suspend uh fixing things until a permanent JP is is is is appointed when there are people two people acting and being paid the same amount of permanent JP and a permanent djp well there is one would be paid to execute these duties for for which you appointed who who took that decision to suspend the the well-being of of the division well um chief justice we had a a discussion about it who the the the entire body of of no no no no just the two of us oh just the two of us um and that was the decision taken to leave the court in limbo while you were being paid to be JP JP sorry to interrupt chief justice apologies um please please interrupt because I want to understand it is not about leaving the court in lumo it's about dealing with hardcore issues where the ajp is also involved it is about having someone to take charge and ultimately take charge of the division so that this can be discussed openly and I think the motivation behind that was because obviously the a JP had ambition to become the JP all right follow upj follow I can make it follow look this is a not I mean on this quickly this is what troubles me throughout I mean I shared the same view by the president of Thea the Chief Justice and other you were yourself you were handpicked by AGB that is she look out of the 30 judges or 31 she recommends you to the minister to be appointed as a is that not so yes he came to me and asked me if I would work with her that's correct commission yes now having picked you that you are a person according to her fits into her own Vision into her own plan you sit with her where she present to you she tells you what she wants to she wants from you how you should support that is you are engaging first your hand picked secondly she present to you what is it that you waiting W for in respect of this Chief I mean sorry judge pres was going to be appointed what what is it that you were waiting for because we are a team that is that has a mutual understanding she picked you and we comfortable work what what was the problem I think um commissioner T must understand that there was certain duties assigned to me by firstly secondly I acted on on those duties yeah thirdly in terms of strategic discussions we didn't go on strategic discuss in terms of things that um we sit in a dark corner and and and chitchat no it is about how can we stabilize the division how can we bring and work together and more importantly is the idea of get getting together and talk about issues that is a deep seated issues yeah that caused sorry as a result of the Fallout between the two leaders yeah no it's right I me I think we leave because just follow but I just want to leave this comment first there is something that we not telling us it is something that that you are not comfortable to tell us because in respect of positive things well we are prepared to say I mean that's fine and then tell us but in in so far as um there are other matters that you don't want to say well you're are not a decision maker and the third answer is that no you have postponed until president is appointed e judge I don't take you back to the the question that was raised by um Commission and I think that's that is where I I got some a feeling at least if I understand this I'm wrong um you were supposed to say was a judge um on a particular matter and because of a moral cord based on what had um with the former judge president and said that other one said that you took a moral course but I cannot sit on this matter with this do I understand that that I think I just help I didn't don't to sit on the matter I don't want to sit with a judge the matter was Lans have got nothing to do with this the file was immediately assigned to someone else without even getting or giv me an opportunity let me just place this in context for the commission is that when I went to the judge I said to him my it's obvious that the Jud they went to the and then this father was just report from my because I was the C judge without giving me opportunity to explain at the time we had already taken decision that to the in other words now you willing to explain why you to save the I understand well I've I've expressed my view to judge to the judge as to um what I'm going to do and I was also prepared to write a judgment on it thank you thank you so much goodon acting Deputy jge president I just want to to take it from where commissioner J has left it he asked you a question about the colate bench and you you responded to it very S I see here there is a disclosure that you you made about your refusal to participate in an appeal matter with one of your former colleagues for one of your colleagues and I don't want to go into the merits and demerits just to check with you if you you think that you are refusal to participate in that matter with the reason that you advance did it enhance collegiality within your Division and I think that in respond to that question you will also do it within the context that it was at the height of tensions and P divisions that were there in the W C division of the high court thank you so much thank you commissioner commissioner not one of my colleages me of and said that I had a problem with in fact I support of 10 other colleagues in this from senior colleagues some of them that the jion some you question no I I I just want to to check with you the man in which you you handled the matter you ision to refuse to participate do you think that that was the best option under the circumstances at the time commissioner let me say this in front of this body before taking that decision CA me sleep this night because it it was not an easy decision but I stand on my Deion the Integrity of the B can never be compromised good afternoon good afternoon yes um to go back to a question that was asked by commission and it was about the discussion about briefing pents um um and I understood you uh to say that in order to assist with changing uh the patterns of briefing your training and it's about networking and people putting themselves out there now I want us to raise the issue with you from a different perspective it seems to me that the bench should have a different interest to change briefing patterns different from to to what what my interests are and different in this way that the bench is supposed to have a vested interest in training for the future bench and I was hoping that when when when commission the issue with you you would answer it from that perspective um what it is if you were appointed as judge president you would do to enhance or to assist with changing the briefing patterns so that the bench of the future benefits from that we've heard from the ajp that he's had to report uh people from outside the province because in her words I think there a because you can find enough or capable black women African women uh to act and she had to get them from outside now I I would like to hear your thoughts about what it is you if you have thought about it uh you would look at doing in order to correct that in of course in the long time uh in order to have options at choosing people for your thank you commissioner ongoing training is vital and important but more particular the ongoing training must be to that extent that it also F in the gaps and as if recommended as judge president that is one of the things that I would look at as the commissioner prob know there are various training programs by S for aspirant women judges uh and that is to be support in that regard the role that I've currently playing in the meantime for being on the buiness as a leader is to actively get involved with the wood courts whether it's from the bar whether it's from students whether we in fact we were at a meeting with UA um some time ago where this particular same issue was raised and we said to the body that they must come and tell us what is it e and how we can help them in that regard in terms of continuous thing because as we all know that parttime studies and we engage with these bodies on a reg regular basis so that is definitely where I'm sitting time to an issue that I will deal with and not only in terms of The Advocates Etc but also the magist I go out regard to training for the magistrates as well um so there's an ongoing process that we have to do covered by and I want to ask you what your position is on taking at jud's meetings what do you think so what is your position on the taking of minutes at judgments meeting what judgments judges meetings what do you think the proper procedure should be I no difficulty with that I mean if we can have a quarter of what transpired and important decisions we take um it can only benefit the division we can always go back and say listen here three months ago decided this why you Chang this it's accountability keeps us accountable as Leaders so um and it should be I me as a leader want to be accountable somebody say listen you decided that two weeks ago and you just now decide something else how can you do this on what basis can you do this so in your position as acting djp did you raise that issue squ I was not in that meeting when it Ur I was on circuit but I mean that is why did you need a meeting to raise the issue no no I raised it I raised it you you raised it with the act and and and what what is the response because he don't want M to be taken excuse me no M to be taken because that is been apparently they according to her memory I speaking under correction when she was uh appointed as a judge she took minut and then there was some story about someone El must take over the men and then there was a decision that the men shouldn't be according to her memory like speaking under correction when she was uh appointed as a judge she took minutes and then there was some story about someone else must take over the minutes and then there was a decision that the minutes shouldn't be taken so so you're saying this is one of those issues where there wasn't anything postponed you had one view the acting JP had another view you squarely raised your view that this is important for accountability but she declined to implement it is that what you say yeah thank you did you say yeah yes sir sorry okay I'm hard of hearing sorry commissioner Assan uh thank you very much uh CJ uh potential follow on but maybe a little bit different um just just to clarify um to preface my question um acting djp how how long have you been acting in the position since April last year April 2023 yes perfect um I'm interested and it's it's an interesting point because it would appear that you've been the only candidate that's acted in the position of djp and I'm interested to know about your thoughts around leveling the playing field and giving exposure and opportunities to others whether you have ever raised with the acting um JP that others should also be given an opportunity to act in your current position uh let's start there Have You Ever Raised that I raised it squarely so you have raised it with I raised it with all right and what was the response from the ajp and your your subsequent I would think response to that her subsequent response was she can't she find it difficult to work with any of the other senior judges for reasons that she advaned and shees of the view that with regard to my temperament the man I deal with issues she feel more comfortable to work with me okay thank you CJ all right thank you very much uh judge we've come to the end of your interview you excused thank you chief justice all right uh we take a quick lunch it's 10 to 10 to 3 come back at half p 3 well come come back at at 20 p 3 so that the candidate can be called and and we ready ourselves and at halfast 3 we interview her or him her all right e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e were the main uh trade unions at the time and so we had to do a lot of labor relations between the the unions and and the company and and Advising the company as such and we also represented the company when I say we it was myself and and and the colleagues that were in the department uh we represented the company at the Chamber of Mines which is an association where the mines were and they would devise National policy for the mines um and also negotiate at that level with the trade unions on wages and all those things I I was also in charge of giving opinions legal opinions on employment matters and also interacting with lawyers outside because I was I was in House Council I would also um appear at the ccma in the labor court because U that was allowed being an employee of the company representing the company to do so um so that that's just generally was my role and I also was in charge of um devising if I can recall the disciplinary code and procedure of the company as well as the anti seexual harassment policy of the company at the time and went we did Road shows and workshops um in different regions and mines so in a nutshell that's what I can say oh yeah while I was there I think it's important to mention this I was asked to uh to be a trustee in the in the board of the Mind workers Provident fund which I chaired um a a few years or a year later if I if I recall so being a chair of the fund I would collaborate with administrators with asset managers and a whole host of stakeholders that had the relationship with the fund um and also was I also got to be in involved in the Institute of retirement funds when I was there as well that is um as a board member The Institute of retirement funds is an Institute where retirement funds administrators in the country um collaborate and and I was part of a number of committees in those structures either as a member or in the executive yes other as a member and also I forgot to mention s that I was in the national executive committee of s law I was elected there when I was still at Samson Oak Higgins attorneys um to be in the national executive committee of s law and I was there for a number of years and I became the vice chairperson of the hting chapter at some point yeah I count 11 years of your involvement with it yes it was a long time all right then you decided to strike it off on your own uh yes then I ventured on my own I think like many young people do you go and Venture and try things and see how it goes and when I went to Port Elizabeth I started a company called um Loi Consulting in fact it its full name was noi investment Holdings uh trading as Loi Consulting because as a startup I the I would do something that I was trained to do which is the consult on employment matters and and and and do training for companies and also at the same time I was in the panel of too I'm sure a lot of people know Doo dispute settlement uh so we would get drawn from the panel to go and arbitrate matters to mediate um to to facilitate whatever that was that would be needed at the time um by the clients that didn't last very long you started another um Enterprise business yes I had a collaboration between myself and and another partner we started schuma business um and labor Services did we did similar work but um my my partner was more human resource inclined and so he devised policies for clients on that line and mine was the labor side of things but because of his illness we couldn't continue with a firm then I had an appetite of wanting to go back to to practice and and and focus on pension law and no longer labor law this time because that's the area that I was now involved in so you joined Tia Incorporated attorneys as director and Senior attorney yes director and Senior attorney and um specifically formed a company a branch of the company in in Port Elizabeth which I which I led and um uh and focused on but I was in charge of the litigation for the entire firm because we had three branches we had the main office in Johannesburg because this is where most of the Pension funds and administrators are located and also in Cape Town because that's where others are and so we had Johannesburg Cape Town and the little branch in Port Elizabeth all right then you allured to the bench yes one day when one day in 2011 judge president um Lambo gave me a call and asked me to come and act at the labor Court in 2011 I think it must have been September or so I can't recall and uh the rest is history the rest is history and then I went to the high court you you acted at the at the labor Court yes acted at the labor Court um I think the second the the last quarter of of the the last term of 2011 then I act I was called again to act in 2012 uh from the second ter if I'm not mistaken and then directly from there I was called to act in the high court so I acted in the high court right through from January 2013 until I was appointed on the 2nd of December 2013 um and at some stage you became involved in the competition appeal court yes I became involved in the competition appeal court in 20 2015 I was asked by judge president at the time um D Dennis Davis to go and act in the competition appeal court and that was appointed by this body or sorry recommended by this body in 2016 and appointed in 2017 and I recall that uh the the vision was for you to take over that Court as it's judge president when uh judge president Davis retired yes I was until the sca post you yes I was informed of that M so how long have you been at the Supreme Court of Appeal I when I when you called me when you were still the chief Justice's president that was from the 1 of April 2020 then I continued to act until my appointment on the 1st of July 2021 so I've been there for four years and apparently you've done so well there that uh right at the moment you were busy filling in your JSC questionnaire for this position the former Chief Justice was contemplating inviting you to go and act at the Constitutional court but we'll get back to that you you've written a number of of of judgments as a judge in all these courts in which you've said yes chief justice about how many would you say on estimate youed all judgments all your judgments uh the ones that I could locate because I traditionally would send my judgments to S although that was not something that was done as a matter of course in the high court judges choose whether or not to send the judgments there but so I was able to locate about 163 I think I I can't remember but I've put it I put an annexure in my questionnaire annexure C and annexure D annexure C deals with the reported judgments in all the courts and then anexa D deals with all judgments that I could locate how many of those reported doesn't have to be an exact number 40 something 43 or yeah I think okay and I heard I saw two more um after I had handed in my application that they were also reported from the sca how long were you a judge at the Western Cape division of the high court I was a judge there for 7 years chief justice okay uh your career trajectory has been is it's Strang one you were offered a leadership position at the competition courts and you chose to go to the appelate division the Supreme Court of Appeal now you had an opportunity to go to the Apex Court well all be an acting stint and you decided to go back to the high court that that that just make that makes sense to me why would a supreme court of appeal Justice one doing well for for herself uh want to go back to to the high court to a a seemingly well not seemingly to a troubled division at that I I know why have you why are you applying for this job is what I'm trying to to get to get from you thank you chief justice I will give an honest answer I was actually nominated for the job and the approach came to me as a surprise and because I was still minding my own business doing my work being comfortable at the Supreme Court of Appeal but I took to heart the confidence that was shown to me by those that nominated me that and I reflected on it that they saw something in me that at this moment in time you have something that we think can be valuable uh to cont for you to contribute in the Western Cape division of the high court and since I come from that court and I'm very much close to it it is the court from where I come I decided that I'm going to accept this because I believe that uh being a judge is an act of service and so you serve as a judge Loosely translated I go to where I'm sent all right that's a Nifty answer okay now are you not worried that uh if you go back there although you spent all those seven years uh in in in your previous life there you would practically be coming in from the cold and uh how how do we know that your appointment would not cause resentment and perhaps meet with resistance um I I'm not new in the court Chief Justice I know all the colleagues in the court in fact even the ones that were appointed after me I had an occasion of uh of of interacting with them on at the personal level and and I can safely say that a number of colleagues have actually called me and they've said to me we are behind you and we are supporting you so I I know that there would be no resentment whatsoever when I go back to the court and I I'm I kept in touch with the colleagues I'm not new and I don't see I don't think they see me as an outsider per se uh because the time that I've spent away from the court is not too long it was only four years and I think that chief justice while we're there I I think as a as a person who has been outside of the court and now coming in I would be bringing a fresh perspective and the manner and the way of seeing things in a new way because I'm not too close to things that are happening there and sometimes when you're not too close you have a a broader view of things all right uh I don't know if uh you have a vision for for the court if you were lucky enough to get appointed what what do you know about his current uh condition and uh what plans if any do you have for it thank you chief justice I have put my vision down and if you would allow me I'm going to read my vision okay thank you my vision for the Western Cape division of the high court is first to ensure that we serve litigants in the public as our constitutional mandate requires of us this means working to cut backlog making Court processes easier continuing to make the court accessible and improving the court experience for its users secondly it is about us who work in the building the judges and the court staff I want to cultivate or enhance a culture of collaboration collegiality openness accessibility and efficiency it is to contribute to making that Court a United and a transformed one which should provide quality Justice to the people of the Western Cape thirdly is about collaboration with the stakeholders who are the users of the services of the Court fourthly working with the magistracy section 84c of the Superior Courts act provides that the judge president of the division is also responsible for the coordination of the judicial functions of all marites courts falling within the jurisdiction of that division so my presentation touches on these aspects why I accepted this nomination this this is the first time in 23 years that a new leader for the Western Cape division of the high court is being considered when when as I've said chief justice When Calls came for me to make myself available for nomination for the position of Judge president I heeded yes after some long and hard deliberation this I did because I took to heart the confidence that those who approach me have in my abilities I was humbled by that I believe that I'm suitably positioned to lead the division and and to set a vision for its future I want to be part of building on the gains that have been made and facilitate any changes necessary for the well-being and development of the division that court is where I learned most of what I know as a judge today it is very close to my heart I literally grew up there I do not come as one with all the answers but as one who would like to be part of the collective that will find Solutions and cultivate a new culture before I went to the division in in January 2013 I was warned about how difficult the place was and how I would be unsettled by the by the environment as an outsider who had not even practiced in that division when I got there I was warmly welcomed by all the colleagues in the division this is partly due to my personality I think I've always enjoyed healthy relationships with colleagues like other workplaces there were challenges but at the heart of it all no matter their differences colleagues in the main worked hard they were respectful and committed to the delivery of Justice they would not let their differences affect the their public duty which was to hear matters and deliver judgments as someone who has been in the division who had been in the division for for seven years and outside of it four years I believe I have a unique set of both experience and skills to lead the division into its immediate future because I have an objective perspective about its present circumstances I'm not new to leadership currently I'm one of the two judges serving in the rules board as its Vice chairperson who together with the chairperson are responsible for leading the board the rules board is a body that is charged with making rules for almost all the courts of this country I'm also one of the six judge six judges who are currently members of the judicial conduct committee a structure that oversees discipline amongst the judges of the highest courts in the country apart from the Chief Justice and the acting deputy chief justice I'm the only other judge current currently in service in that committee I would like to think that I was appointed to these positions because I have leadership qualities I'm a presider currently at the Supreme Court of Appeal a presider is a senior judge who manages several matters allocated to them and other judges in the term members of a panel usually include acting judges the presider not only directs the proceedings in court but provides guidance on the approach to be taken in matters and assist Junior and acting colleagues when consulted on substantive issues before I became a judge I served in various leadership positions in the legal profession and in the society at large as I've mentioned with the Chief Justice including the South African society for labor law The Institute of retirement funds mind workers Provident fund vision for women which is very close to my heart an organization in Port Elizabeth that inspires mentors and empowers young girls and women um to be to to know that they can be something better better in life and other bodies I also managed a company that I was part of and as well as a branch of a law firm of which I was a director I also did management and Leadership courses early on in my career all that is in my CV one of my other unique skills and experience that I would bring to the court is an emphasis on thought leadership which would help strengthen the dur Prudence of the Court I've had the unique privilege of having set in four different courts including the appell courts the CAC and presently the sca the advantage of sitting at the appell court is interaction with colleagues who come from different divisions around the country with this experience I bring a broader and the Richer perspective at the sca we sit in panels in every matter where one learns to respect and accommodate other views and where we cannot find each other to to disagree without being disagreeable as a judge of almost 11 years and 13 including my acting students I've been a hard worker and I and I believe I have a strong work ethic I've LED from the front and Leadership positions I've been I've held I've never shied away from challenges I've written judgments in complex matters even as a junior member of a panel in the high court and in the appell courts I've also shown my independent mindedness in that where I differed with colleagues I would write separately no matter how complex the matter was and how much time the research it would involve at the sca I've had exposure and engag in complex legal issues across the Spectrum since 2020 I would have participated in approximately 10 to 12 sometimes 15 matters in a term on average translating to about 160 or more appeals up to to date the division is uniquely placed it is in the province where the national legislature seat is the present this presents it with opportunity with an opportunity of ning the talent and cultivating strong um Jes Prudence in areas of administrative law and constitutional law I would encourage continuous learning in the court by promoting the culture which I found when I first went there of senior colleagues assisting junior members I would advocate for a structured IND induction and mentorship program to assist acting and new acting and new judges in reviews The Division has always had a practice of having two judges sitting together this can be a platform to pay a senior judge a senior colleague with a junior one for transference of skills so so that the inexperienced judge is not thrown into the deep end I'm aware that there are two two senior judges at the moment who or who had held workshops with acting judges we will build on that the division could have a Judicial education committee like the one in the Howen division which develops a program per term by promoting peer learning workshops every Thursday lunchtime on topical issues I know that the division has always sorry his colleagues I know that the division's colleagues who have vast experience in specific areas of the law I would identify and their strengths and weaknesses with a view to utilizing their expertise in the strength in the areas of strengths but also to balance the allocation of matters so as to expose all colleagues to a wide range of cases in order to build capacity for the court to the advantage of the litigants my focus will also be on enriching our judgment where is this document do we have it no oh no should I continue I thought huh sorry I thought we we we do we not need it well I've I've been listening very intently so we we we we can we can ask uh yes I can share the document afterwards I was not asked to to to to make it available yeah mayor kba well we didn't know you were going to read the document so okay yeah no but you can make it available to us as do so can I continue to yes please okay my focus was on that on this part that my focus would be on en reaching our judgment writing skills with an understanding that while judgments are primarily written for the litigants they may also be precedent setting and they are also used as teaching tools the division has been for years circulating a list of Reserve judgments which um Works successfully to get judgments done this is useful in keeping a watchful eye on bottlenecks and delays to ensure that judgments are delivered timelessly I would identify reasons for late delivery of judgments and find ways of assisting colleagues who have challenges as part of ensuring our accountability to the public I would encourage colleagues as I've said earlier to appload judgments to Sly as that is not consistent ly happening and prepare media summaries for all important judgments transformation remains a key discussion issue for the Judiciary Western Cape has unique challenges on this aspect in both the legal profession and on the bench many black African judges who became judges in the Western Cape did not practice in that in that Province the majority came from the other places now I'm including those that also have retired currently there are few black and women senior advocates at the bar only two black African men and no African woman who is a silk when I last checked the website their tennis profession suffers from the same lack commendably very good black African judges have been drawn from the magistracy this is this is a good balance and shows that um one need not only look at the practitioners I would do my homework to also draw acting judges from the Academia in the province um and from elsewhere in the country transformation and Excellence are not mutually exclusive Concepts they must go together given our unequal past while we transform we must mentor and develop skills in a structured way to get us all to the level that benefits the litigant the immediate challenge in the division is working towards change in how colleagues relate to one another we have to work towards creating a culture of openness transparency and cohesion where would build an environment of trust I hope to provide to provide leadership that is attentive felt visible accessible and collaborative my role as a leader is to help others to do their work to the best of their ability how will I facilitate this I will visit each colleague in their Chambers I know this sounds simple I will visit each colleague in their Chambers to find out what the issues are to open commun communication channels between the head of the court and the colleagues we are human beings before we are Judges I would then encourage holding a boss barad maybe with a facilitator to talk about issues faced by the division My Hope Is that in those conversations would be able to cover out a vision for the future of the division shortterm medium and longterm we would hold regular judges meetings to ensure feedback transparency and accountability I would like us to work as a team where colleagues are part of the decision making process and the administration of the Court involvement in committees is one way of achieving that I'm aware that there are committees in the court currently some more active than others we would review their effectiveness with a view to enhancing them and creating more participation I would suggest the creation of an Elders type of committee which can be made up of senior colleagues including the judge president and the deputy judge president or the chairs of committees or any other formulation that colleagues may find suitable this committee would discuss matters that that require attention between the plenary judges meetings it may also advise on acting appointments for example I would also meet regularly with the court staff as they are the backbone of administration collaboration with the chief regist Court manager and the provincial head is is important courts are facing various challenges at the moment Central to which are shrinking resources which affect the turnaround times for service delivery the court does not have enough Personnel in the register's office it has lost a lot of personnel and they are not being replaced interpreters resigned in numbers after lockdown this leads to postponement in criminal trials backlogs in criminal trials remain a big challenge facing all the courts and as we heard when the former Chief Justice gave statistics in the Judiciary annual report for the period of 2022 to 2023 Targets in all divisions were very low at 30% although many divisions outperformed their targets the Western Cape sitting at 58 58% of finalized cases for that period backlogs remain unrelenting case management in criminal matters has been in place in the division for many years there is however an increase in criminal trials even when certified trial ready they cannot speedily be heard or resolved um so collaboration between the leadership of the court and the dpp's office to manage this is key there must be discussion as to which matters should be coming to the high court and when for proper planning in turn the operational consultations between Court administrators their operational counterparts at the dpp's office as well as the police regarding operational matters in preparation for criminal trials should be installed collaboration is also required with the legal aid to streamline their decision-making processes when considering applications as regards civil matters judges are involved in case management and pre-trials are held every second week I was part of that when I was there there is a significant increase in pra matters and we know the big elephant in the room are rough matters and the cripping increase in medical negligence cases and in my view heads of Court should engage with the rough to find ways on how it can improve in bringing matters to court the earliest States available for allocation in civil trials I I was told is um in August 2025 the earliest date available for semi urgent is in January 2025 but there are those set down for March 202 as well for opposed motions matters are being allocated for February 2025 case flow management Remains the most effective way of weeding out matters that should not go to trial early on but this must go hand inand with mediation mediation as you would have seen in my CV mediation is very close to my heart I'm one of the seven judges who were sent to Utah to be trained as a mediator and as a trainer we came back and conducted various workshops for judges magistrates and traditional leaders via SJ with which was well received and well attended colleagues were given some practical tools of how they would conduct mediation the idea was not to have judicial officers mediating all matters per se but to sell mediation as an effective tool of resolving disputes to equip judges with skills they could use in case r management and to encourage litigant where appropriate to opt for mediation mediation offers a lot of benefits it is cost effective it may lead to Speedy resolution of matters and the solution comes from the parties themselves modernization and digitization will go a long way in helping with court deficiencies judges and Court staff have been trained on case lines and I'm also trained was trained on case lines twice at the sca and I'm made to believe that the division is ready for the roll out and that and that there will be a self-help facility that will be put in place in the court for those that cannot upload in their home homes or in their offices the roll out of case lines means traveling to court from far away places to file documents will be a thing of a past judges and practitioners will have access to documents online wherever they are and in court the system will also help with the auring of spa with the auring space which the court is currently uh struggling with litigation is expensive as part of enhancing access to Justice I would move for the cre ation of a prono desk mened by lawyers on a weekly basis particularly for unrepresented litigants in motion Court I will collaborate with the legal profession on how this can be formalized and even recognized as a as prono hours for the benefit of participating practitioners I will collaborate with the legal profession to listen to their concerns as recipients of our services and on ways of improving our systems second courts are key in bringing Justice to the people ways in which we can make them more effective and accessible will be looked at I would also look into the proposal by the rationalization committee where which I saw in the document to make tetu Second Court a local seat I would interact with the magistracy to address issues Beyond reporting at the PE there are several challenges that need attention for instance the method of how posts are created in the Regional mistes Court is outdated it was last reviewed in 20 in 2008 Regional courts are centered around the city and bigger towns so Regional Court magistrates in those areas are expected to service other areas which are not as small as they were in 20 in 2008 for instance a magistrate from Cape Town would go for only 5 to 10 days in a month to Hermanas which is which has about 200 criminal cases why can't a post be created in Hermanas for instance Hermanas is not the only place there are other places as well the attainment of a single Judiciary is imperative the magistracy needs to be supported by the Judiciary Beyond case flow management and and and coordination of Statistics I would add my voice to the calls for full in institutional Independence for the Judiciary and the better resource Judiciary thank you chief justice and Commissioners for listening to me thank you justice that's a lofy and all encompassing Vision I must say but have you been well you've given us a lot of intimate detail that seems to S suggest that you've been in touch with the court yes to get a accurate sense of of of of of of its state correct chief justice I was I was in touch with the with the court administration okay to get correct information as to what is the state of affairs with regards to court administration I also was in touch with colleagues in the division just to put me up to speed because it was necessary for me to have those details um for the purposes of of understanding what the current circumstances in the division are okay you you do many things and some of those are holding the position of Vice chairperson of the rules board for courts of law yes and you you're also one of the six members of the judicial conduct Committee of this body yes chief justice okay okay well the oh you mentioned uh mediation as one of your passions you did not mention that you also trained judges you have trained and trained judges in cyber crime and competition law as well yes yes when I think that was a few years ago before there was still a Cy cyber crime bill at the time and there was a European team that came I just can't remember their name that they came via SJ and they um trained trainers judges as trainers and then we had to train other judges or at least sensitize them maybe not train but sensitize them about cyber crime and what it is all about right well um it's impressive that all the professional bodies support your candidature and uh they speak very highly of you that the GCB saying you have a reputation for integrity and ethical Behavior and you are a well respected judge in the cape division especially among practitioners so that's quite a compliment I humbled by that chief justice all right uh I will leave it here for now uh justice M judge gamble do you have questions for this candidate thank you C and good afternoon good afternoon former colleague if I may say judge good afternoon judge k your list of judgment is is is is impressive to say the least thank you um you've covered all areas of the law um my eye falls on matter number 28 called the Polaris you remember that matter I remember it we had an interesting discussion about it at the time because it was a shipping case that crossed over into business rescue that's right yes and uh I see that you say that that's been internationally acknowledged now yes I actually stumbled on it um sometime on a publication that was done and that was interested and I read it and I found that in fact the it was a subject of the publication because it talked about the intersection between company law and and and shipping La yes and um for those who don't know Cape Town has a very busy shipping practice the cape and Durban courts do a lot of the shipping matters yes um I dare say this is one of the first judgments um written by an African black woman on shipping law and that was quite a quite a sealing to break through oh I didn't know that um J banaana the the question that I and many of your colleagues are asking is why are you moving south rather than North I think there's a gr there's a PO I ask and I ask it with with respect for the following reason um your Acumen lies in in research and and strong judgment writing you've um you occupy uh I think a fairly senior position in the sea now you've LED panels there um that that court is going to be depleted but many see your your future in in the Constitutional Court um do you have any long-term any long-term goals in that regard you know commissioner it's very difficult to actually answer those that question at this point in time because three years ago was it three or four three years ago when I sat in this on this chair I did not know that I would be sitting on this chair again today but one thing I can say is that I'm committed you know where I to be appointed um in the high Court as a judge president to stick around and stay in the high court because one thing I can commit to is that I will not abandon the court because I'm committed to making sure that what I envisage myself doing and and contributing at the court is brought to um to pass and I can see it um so being s successful if I look at your your personal details um in paragraph 4.1 um you just 51 years and and some months and you will have completed with your appointment if you're successful just over almost 11 years uh you would then be entitled to exit uh at 65 would you not yes because you will have done 20 yes 20 years so the minimum period that you would be in the court would be 13 years well for me I don't look at 65 for now because I'm not because I'm not about to retire so that's not even something that I'm thinking about so what I think of retirement I think 70 is somewhere down the line let me assure you that when you get to 64 and a half you'll be thinking very seriously about the the 20e option but but Jokes Aside you you you could you could exit after 13 years um failing that you would have you would have been in the position for approximately 18 years that's if you wented 70 yes which is the maximum that's right period that you could um during that time you are going to be involved as we've heard this morning from from the other colleagues in a considerable amount of administration work yes and I my concern is that we will lose your contribution to the jurist Prudence because you're going to have a lot a lot more on your plate obviously you you will go in and sit in the big cases that's right that's what judge's President should do yes and that's always done it but they should do it they should go in lead the the Judiciary on the Juris Prudential side that's right um and that would be my concern and and I'll give you a chance to to think about it that you you you're going to lose your you lose your contrib we're going to lose your contribution to the jurist Prudence um at the cost of administration and fixing fixing broken toilets and things like that if You' seen my path um commissioner as we were discussing with the Chief Justice I I I've actually I consider myself an allrounder because I didn't just go and practice law I did a lot of things and and that makes me a person who actually well exposed into many things I don't see being a judge president as Administration in the sense of doing you know small things and tasks like that and maybe allocating matters and all that I see it as a broader thing because it is is a leadership position where where you set the tone not just for the court in how the culture yes the Juris Prudence also the province uh because you take along the magistracy with you so it is it is a it is a position that is broader than just Administration and then excuse me lastly um you will um inherit and if you get the position you will inherit an incumbent Deputy yes who has been um in a leadership position as a deputy for eight years I think seven eight years yes and in a in a leadership position for two years do you foresee any problems um between cooperating with with Deputy Deputy judge president G if you get the position not at all for my side definitely not uh commissioner I've known Deputy judge president Goliath for a long time um since I was in the division for seven years and I've had a number of interactions with her and I respect her I think that uh the position of the Deputy judge president is an important position because it is not only a supporting role to that of the of of the judge president the Jud the deputy judge president has tasks that are generally allocated to them by the judge president but besides that when the judge president is not in available for whatever reason the deputy judge president um does the job and so it's important that we work together effectively and in a in a matured way and that is something that I commit to do and then there are no issues between the there are no issues between us thank you thank you J thank you thank you CJ thank you judge kambo Mr bosov thank you CJ and afternoon uh judge buana right here okay um at the risk of but I don't want to repeat um judge Gamble's questions to you but um so a friend of mine once said to me when I was bemoaning my career PA Etc he said you know sometimes choice is a curse as well and um I just want to inquire a bit about your career path and your decisions in your career and and and please see it as a compliment because clearly your membership of the Judiciary is something um we should all be very grateful for you are in you the world is your oyster so to speak now you mentioned that you that there was a potenti you know possibility for a leadership role at the competition appeal court but that was then overtaken by your current um you know the opportunity that you then pursued at the sca um may I ask why and and is my suspicion correct that the sca was seen as um academically a bit you know more challenging and and satisfying potentially or or what what informed your decision to instead of pursuing a leadership role at that position at that point to pursue um the the opportunity at the ACA and then with regards to now you know the potential for you know within the near future opportunities at the Apex quarter Rising what then informs your decision to rather pursue here because and and this brings me back to choice being a curse you know whatever you were to pursue I'm sure you would succeed that and with a potential career span of 18 years still ahead of you what Assurance do we have that 5 years from now you won't be sitting here again or in 3 years from now for an opportunity at the Apex Court okay and and and yeah and that's just within the context of a division that really re urgently requires long-term stability and long-term commitment um thank you yes thanks let's start with the first question about competition appeal court there were no firm discussions at that time between myself and and the judge president Dennis Davis it was just a futuristic thing that this is something that he would like me to do in the future so it was not something that was colliding per se at the time and so um and the other reason is that the competition appeal court is a specialist court and doesn't open you up so you you you would be dealing with just one area of the law yes you'll be in the high court as well but at that point I thought being at the sca where you would learn a lot more um would be something that I would like to do and that is why I opted for the SAA I didn't think about it in that sense at the time and and I mean I want to repeat my commitment when it comes to me now being um approached and having accepted to be um um considered for the judge president position of the Western Cape high court that my um um what what I'd like to do is to have that that Division coming to the stability that will make everybody um happy about the where it would be at the time and I would not abandon the division and just simply fly away and say well because this is not about a personal ambition because even moving from the Supreme Court of Appeal and coming here it is not a personal ambition issue it's about people thinking we need you more here and me saying okay I'm going to accept that call thank you CJ just with your Indulgence I mean I know it wasn't one question but if that could be my first question that's go away then just the the second question um chief justice I wanted to make a a followup on what he said all right you can either on the first one yeah um mine is very quick president M was interviewed like you for a position of JP in Free State yes and in a short space of time she went to become the president of the sca did that court of free state collapse after that no it didn't it was left stable thank you thank you commissioner carry on Mr um so you judge you would be aware of of the um objections filed um in in during this process and you filed the response quite a comprehensive response I don't want to go into the detail of it yes I think um my question is just that um the complaints centered around your relationship um professional engagement with with with court staff and and support staff and administrative staff at the division were you to be successful um in in this process you would obviously have to work with some of the people at the center of this objection and your response on a daily basis how do you propose to mend those fences or build those bridges again um you know because was quite an unpleasant to and fro and and I don't want to breathe life into into it I just want to you are actually not allowed to breathe life into it because uh the objections Committee of this body it deliberates on all the complaints that come against uh candidates it carefully adjudicated that matter and found that it had no merit and made a decision that is binding on all of us not to put questions about it to the candidate and this is not just unique to this candidate it it serves for other candidates who've come and are still coming CJ my understanding is that the committee dismissed part of it that that had the double heay attached to it but that the remaining there was the other half of it that they were comfortable with us but I I I will defer to the committee to confirm or or correct me if that is the case then you you are most welcome to on the uncontroversial part CJ the point is that's why I say I don't want to go into the detail of it but but clearly they whether it's whatever might liely it um the candidate will be if success will be going into a division where there is this for lack of a better ter thing in the air um and and I would just like to just from a leadership point you find out how how she would address it there wouldn't be actually because those people are not in the court the the people who wrote in are not in that Court well one is no he's not no both of them are not in the well the one was never employed the other was an ex employee we dismissed the first one about the uh Widow completely the second one is relevant in so far as a general point but not the complaint but whether or not judge buana has a good relationship with staff that's open to ask Perhaps Perhaps given that there isn't really a delicate way of then asking the question I'll I'll rather abandon that line of question I would not want to deprive of an opportunity of putting a question you think is worth asking Mr posof as I said before you you you you may ask on the part that the objections committee said we may ask I think maybe then I'm just not comfortable going down that line and perhaps overstepping CJ so I'm I'm not comfortable doing that okay I don't think it' be fair to this process okay thank you then then then I have no further questions okay thank you commissioner M I don't know if you had it was a followup okay yeah uh commissioner thank you very much CJ good afternoon judge good afternoon commissioner um since these interviews have started um a lot of people have been asked in terms of their trajectory and their history of assisting people from disadvantaged backgrounds um and their role as they progressed taking the village with you of a a situation and even some of the candidates who are actually trying to get this post they've been asked if they are successful um what is it that they going to do to make sure that all that we are complaining about briefing patterns and all these kind of things at some level they are they are addressed I want to ask on that sense that in in your own journey of of success which is quite remarkable um what what have you done um to ensure that as you progress um those who were at the bottom you actually carried them with you going going forward and when you get the post what is it that you are going to do to contribute to the debate that people from disenfranchized sort of communities they deserve to be given opportunities to showcase what they can do I mean you you in your vision you referred that U at the C B for instance there there are two males who are senior counselors and there is no so those are the challenges that we are faced with when you assume this leadership role um what will then be your role but I'm interested first in your journey before you answer the the second part of the question chief justice could I just intervene here could I ask uh the commissioner to rephrase two questions which is when you get the post to if you get the post oh thank you very much commissioner if you get a post thank you very much commissioner thank you so much commissioner I am I take Keen interest in actually mentoring I I take Keen interest in mentoring particularly women because I believe that I'm where I am because other people took me along with them and mentored me and so I don't only talk and give speeches in conferences and workshops and seminars I have one-on-one mentorship I have people even currently that I mentor and I and and actually someone that I bumped into also here said to me judge she I think she's applying for a position I don't know if it's tomorrow she bumped me said judge I remember you held my hand and you said you know that's fine we want to see your hear your voice in the judgment and you showed me the ropes when I first came to act in the court and so that is what I do um and and and and and when it comes to the the Western Cape the Western Cape has a has a difficult a different kind of um scenario when as compared to other places um other places you will be able to find a professional African person everywhere you go but in the West Cape you don't necessarily get them readily there or you don't see that they probably are there so what one of the first things that I would do is to actually interact with a legal profession that we may go and find people because I believe that there are people in the corners I was also found in some Corner in Port Elizabeth so we we need to collaborate with the legal profession to try and find people one but also not to do only to do that but to Mentor people because you have to understand that we come from an unequal past and therefore we need to pick each other up and so make sure that we are exposed in these kinds of areas but the third thing is that um I think this discussion also involves businesses clients and so it's a legal profession and people that that give instruction and brief people that must be involved in this debate I'm talking about big business and I'm talking about big firms to be involved in this discussion Russ so that they can influence their clients to to brief and give instructions to black people and give them a chance thank you thank you CJ president M yes thank you very much uh CJ good afternoon my sister Justice banaana good afternoon president just to record that you and I met for the first time in 2012 when you were still acting at the labor court is correct you correct you you borrowed me your bib yes and we have had a cordial relationship ever since definitely I'm just saying this just to clear the air that you are not running away from the no not at all not at all president yes um you'll confirm that you and I have had several conversations yes um regarding your what I thought would be your career path yes that's correct president in your Mission you you reference was made to your strong work ethic and I can attest to that and it was precisely because of that that we had several conversations along the lines of your career path that's correct President also that after uh being nominated for this position you called me and we had a long conversation and uh you indicated that you wanted My Views before accepting finally accepting the nomination that's correct president yes thank you my last question um you alluded to the fact that uh you were attached to to kiso dispute resolution center at some point as a mediator and that you attended a uh seminar in ut on mediation and so forth and mentioned that only in relation to the importance of mediation as an alternative to adjudication or ADR yes yes but um if appointed do you think that your experience as a mediator would come in handy in terms of healing the Rifts among colleagues that currently exist in that division definitely president because mediation is about pulling people together who are in conflict and you have the skills of being able to write to ask the right questions and to assist parties to finding a solution so I I believe that those skills will definitely come in handy thank you justice thank you CJ thank you president thank you president uh commissioner go thank you CJ um I do have a question but before I ask it I just want to go back to Mr Russell Daniels and I will try my best not to overstep good afternoon judge good afternoon commissioner um judge do you know Mr Russell Daniels I I know him as an aser who used to be at the court so I know him like all the ushers in the court yes now do is there any reason why Mr Daniels would fabricate such a story I don't know I'm also shocked I was actually taken so much AB back so I don't know what commissioner Godel the decision was that the candidate would not be asked about that objection because it was adjudicated and found meritless so we can't put questions by our own resolution we can't put questions to this candidate about that objection that's how that's how this works that you do have the policy the objections polic of the Judicial Service Commission yes yeah you you can't put those questions all right well I'll move on then um so judge you've been in the western capap high court for seven years yes I was um and how much criminal um experience did you gain in that time a lot in in my first year of acting I was involved in a criminal case and it was it it involved um rape and and murder and um a case where I had to impose life in my first that was my first criminal trial and I've done criminal trials a lot in that Court Criminal Appeals from the meres court so and also currently do Criminal Appeals in the at the sca so in my 11 years I've done a lot of criminal work okay so um the Western Cape is plagued by um Gang Related matters quite a lot of them uh some of them will probably take multiple years to conclude yeah um and that attributes to the backlog of the criminal role yes at the same time the Department of Correctional Services also has a massive problem with remand detainees yes so in your um Vision you explained um that you would Le leaz with the DPP the legal aid and other stakeholders to address the backlog in the criminal role but I was just um wondering what if you could maybe just explain how you would also work with the magistracy and the justice department and perhaps Correctional Services to encourage AVR technology you know electronic hearings in order to address the issue um regarding ramont detainees yes I think that's important I would work with them to make sure that when it is not necessary for a matter to be physically in court then we can deal with those matters in that way so I would collaborate with them thank you commissioner Chief Justice Just to follow up uh not on the crime issue but on that first issue okay just to um for those Commissioners who were not uh with us when we began we reported on the matter that uh the two objections were considered and dismissed we then said it is still open to us ask the candidate whether or not they've got good relationships with staff because it's an important aspect of leadership but the objections were both dismissed and that is why the Chief Justice keeps reminding commissioners of our own decision in accordance with our own objections policy exactly come from commissioner thank you for the intervention commissioner no thank you chief justice good afternoon judge B good afternoon commissioner no my just to put on record I was the the the question by Justice M was the same question I wanted to ask so you covered yeah all right thank you commissioner commissioner uh thank you very much CJ judge um let me start by first addressing some of the important cases you've presided over and I think it is just relevant to to mention it um also as a Muslim woman as someone who does represent um that Community uh quite often and just to to say how important and how groundbreaking it's been um I mean even my own grandmothers and many many members of my community um have for a very long time been fighting for recognition so I think it's just important to ackowledge um the activist role and nature of some of those uh cases but to my to my question um CJ through you I'm very interested and and I I I picked up pieces of it when you were relaying your vision but maybe it's just a little bit easier to to speak to it now there are seven senior judges in the Western Cape division who will retire in the next two years yes um and I think it's cumulatively almost 100 years of experience and another candidate also mentioned this um so I'm interested in your views around around how to build a strong pool of succession um but also what you will do beyond the regular run-ofthe-mill um acting stins um and sort of going on courses I'm very interested on that and perhaps relate it somewhat um if you could also bring in the rationalization project uh which is quite a big thing ongoing in the Judiciary thank you thank you thank you so much commissioner um the first one um I think it's important to use the skill of the retired judges by making sure that we bring them back to assist with workshops on important topics and and also to to call the judges back for important matters um um where they can sit and transfer skills to Junior colleagues one of the things that I think might be important relates to criminal trials where we have a backlog one of the things we could do is to recall or maybe ask retired judges and perhaps Regional Court uh reti magistrates that have retired to assist with uh the backlogs perhaps during recess periods because of the shortage of courts that we might have during term and so we need to utilize those skills and not simply let the skills go without being tapped into um when it comes to the acting I think it's important not to develop people only by acting but educating so there should be education not only of acting judges but of Judges themselves because we have to continue to learn because things keep changing and adapting and developing so I would encourage as I've said continuous learning and it must be structured induction programs must also be structured um the last question was about uh can you just repeat the the the rationalization let me let me let me actually phrase it properly because I do have it here um about what you can do to enhance access uh more particularly to the poor and marginalized taking into account the rational rationalization um interventions and projects that's ongoing in the Judiciary thank you thank you very much commissioner um I think one of the things that's mentioned in the rationalization report is whether or not the Western Cape should have a local seat because currently we have a main seat in Cape Town and that is the only one and then we have second courts around and we have tetu um in in in George uh which which sits um five weeks a term that also Services um um places around it and so I think the local having a local seat will be will will bring access to Justice to the people who don't have to come to Cape Town and saving on transportation and all that um I think it's important also there was something else that was mentioned in the report that had to do with concurrent jurisdiction that that needs to be addressed I don't I don't I haven't thought through it as to exactly how the issue of concurrent jurisdiction between the magistrates court and the high courts that you find a situation where a plaintiff picks a court they would normally pick a high court because they think that high court is more efficient and they'll get Speedy Justice now the defendant has to travel all the way to the high court and in a matter that could have been dealt with at the M Court's level and and and and and that's the first thing and the second thing is the the defendant will have to get lawyers and pay them at the rate that is higher than that which they give I know that the courts normally give the scale when they give costs the matter is SC scale but that doesn't address the issue so those are the things that we need to think about about uh as we rationalize okay judge presid thank you very much chief justice good afternoon judge maana good afternoon judge president I think you've already mentioned that uh the first time we met you had already accepted an acting invitation to the labor Court yes um on that last issue the the con court and the sca have already said the high court has no choice whether the matter is a MAG cot matter it must hear it if it comes to the high yes I I understand I've read that judgment unless you will pull some magic and help us yes no I think for me it's more about perhaps education judge president and for people to understand the benefit of having the matters being heard at the place that's closest to the people than getting people to travel all the way to to the high court um I heard your vision I listened very attentively do you actually know what is the problem in the Western Cape division um judge president I was part of the court and then there are historical issues in the court yes that happened when I was still in the court Dynamics whether overt or covert but and tensions and all that so so there are issues that I know and some of the issues that came to the public domain happened at least the first two months that I was still in that court and so I do know what the problems are in the court and I also know it because the colleagues have kept me informed about the court because I'm interested in knowing what the problems are okay thank you very much for that now um it appears on a Case flow front there's a problem in terms of a skewed capacitation reality in that more judges seem to be required to do criminal trials than civil work in particular uh I'm not I'm not sure if you are aware of that Dynamic and if so what will you do if you are appointed to address that that problem thanks thanks uh judge president I'm aware of the problem I think maybe before I answer the question of what would I do maybe I should say the consequences of that problem um that the permanent judges that should be developed the Juris Prudence of the Court are taken away from civil matters that are important because of the problem and you get acting judges coming on an out toog basis and there's no continuity therefore and development in that regard and so that is that is for me an issue that we would need we are to be appointed there that is an issue we would need to focus on um because we have to get continuity and and empowering also so that even judges within the division get a fair spread a wide spread of matters and then when it comes to my ideas on how we can deal with a Criminal backlog the first thing is an obvious one which is uh the strong relationship with the dpp's office because it's important for that discussion to take place that some of these matters are not supposed to be in the high court there are simple matters that are supposed to be at the regional court because I think the Regional Court in my own view is the court that is supposed to be the trial of facts basically on criminal matters and and and and what it robs of what what happens when a person when a simple matter comes to the high court that accused is robbed of an automatic right of appeal because because when when they when the matter is said in the high court they have to apply for leave to appeal as opposed to when the matter comes from the regional court and so so so that relationship between the dpp's office and the leadership of the courts is very important and it it must be tightened up the second issue um is is the I I was told that there was a pilot project in the court where the court identified one accused the matter where there was just one accused matters that could just be removed from the role swiftly those matters um um as I think I've already mentioned that we perhaps can have a project where we have retired um judges and and retired Regional Court um judges and perhaps practitioners that could do that but during resear maybe deal with those simple matters that we can get off the table quite quickly um those are just the the maybe the shortterm things that we can do thank you um CJ I don't know um I still have a question unrelated but I have a followup to this one okay ask ask the questions you have JP I'm sure they will be ask thank you you are a head of court so you hold a special status thank you very much um the follow-up question relates to the overall responsibility of a JP in a division yes you also have some oversight responsibilities over the lower courts yes the regional courts I'm sure you heard from commissioner Godel I don't know whether he asked that question or maybe he didn't that uh awaiting trial detainee periods are a big problem in the regional courts they spend years on trial before their matters are finalized it will be something that will be your responsibility as head of the division to try and assist do you have any ideas how you could do that if you are appointed um I think um judge President we could look at the causes maybe first whether we have enough people enough compliment of the Regional Court magistrates as I've indicated I think that with the the the the establishment what what is currently being used in that regard is outdated so we need to review that look into into reviewing that and also secondly to look at the bottlenecks what are the causes of inefficiencies in the system that make matters uh that create the backlogs and so that is that is how I would for now that's what I can think of Judge president thank you thank you very much my last question the high courts have a problem with the reserve judgments I'm sure you've read about that in the Judiciary reports and in the reserve judgement reports that come out periodically yes um I think the problem in the Western Cape is not as pronounced as some courts like mine yes but uh do you have any ideas what you would do if you got the job to ensure that uh judges deliver their judgments uh at least within reasonable times taking account of the fact that we don't have judgment writing time um unless you look at resist thank you thank you judge president I would identify what what is the problem uh why why the particular colleague maybe I'd look at the pattern as to uh how many colleagues and who are these colleagues who tend to have judgments reserved and and go to the colleagues and try and look at ways in in which I can assist them if it is a matter of capacity maybe alleviate some of the pressure to them so that they can be able to do to do the Judgment I know what what used to be done sometimes is to give a judge a trial a criminal trial because when a person does a criminal trial they've got some flexibility in playing around with their time that they can use to also write the judgments thank you very much for that thank you CJ thank you JP commissioner n thank you good good afternoon judge B good afternoon commissioner they they just uh one question I think you have touched on this in your plan but it keeps on going around what is your view about the importance of a good relationship with the staff that is I think we have touched on that but if you can speak to it just again it's it's very very important I mean the stuff they are the core support of the judges so they are the backbone of of that Administration and they help the judges to do their work well and and and so it's important for judges to have a good relationship and take K interest in the people that um that they work with not just being interested in the work they do but being interested in them as a person thank you CH no question commissioner thank you CJ good afternoon judge good afternoon commissioner yes um judge you you spoke about mediation yes um and that you've trained you've you provided training to to judges after you attended yes the mediation course um now could you share with us in in how does how does it get practical lied um it it's obviously a well-intended um dispute resolution mechanism alternative dispute resolution mechanism we have it in rule 41 a um and but when one looks at rule 41A at least the first parts of it it's more a mechanical um process where people indicate whether they want to engage in mediation my experience is that generally um litigant seem to prefer to to to choose not to go to to mediation what what do you see do yourself doing if you're appointed to this position to practical eyesee this alter alter native dispute resolution mechanism whose whose purpose is to to move or at least to ease the backlog in the courts um thank you commissioner as I understand there is thinking to move towards Court annexed mediation at the moment and we are currently awaiting legislation to indicate what kind of model would we have um in our country would it be a hybrid model model of having for instance um almost said Commissioners um AR mediators coming from the outside privately or would we have a ccma type of thing where you have people employed within the system and assisting um the the training when that we did was not to make judges necessarily mediators but it was to assist them with the with the tools one to to get them to know what mediation is all about so that they can sell it to to to the litigants in front of them they so the judge would not just say well this is a matter that needs to go to mediation but the judge will be able to say why mediation is important in circumstances like this I'll U um I had an example but maybe I should leave that one um rule 41A I know that it is seen by a lot of people as just a tick box exercise because someone feels in a form no mediation yes or no but it is really something that is meant to nudge people to think about mediation deeper and perhaps a judge can assist in educating people there about mediation at case management level at least because I think those two should work together um so I would encourage mediation in that way that at case management level in matters that are deserving family disputes and other matters please let's engage meaningfully with the parties as to whether or not mediation is not appropriate and and and tell them what the benefits of of mediation are thank you C CJ sorry follow up who's that oh commissioner go ahead thank you very much again judge on the issue of mediation um obviously even in the rules of court now um you have to show some interest in mediation before at the high court before you Institute Institute the matter and obviously the M court that is Court annexed and all those kind of things um but isn't it that mediation is now going the roote of arbitration where we see the marsh rooming of uh private organizations that are doing especially in family law that are doing mediation and the costs associated with mediation are contrary to how mediation has been advertised don't we not experiencing that challenge now that's true I mean I think that's an impediment for many people who think that well at this point I have to pay for the mediator I have to pay for the cost of mediation and and I think that's one of the things we still need to think about creatively is how to do and if I recall the land court at the moment there is a provision for costs and it's not the parties that pay for the mediator and we still have to devise rules as the rules board as how how those the mediators will be paid if I recall I might be wrong so I think you correct it is actually an impediment for many people and we have to find ways of how we can be able to make make it less less um cost to be cost effective rather thank you very much CJ thank you commissioner Just One Last uh question from me uh justice m one of the judgments you list um as as your reported judgments is um is the case of Lisa s which uh is bilingual you you wrote it in English and is the closer yes uh is this and by this I mean the practice of writing Court judgments in our indigenous languages is this something um that we should encourage and is it a practice that you would uh uh enforce at at at the Western Cape division of the high court if you you get this job definitely chief justice I think there should be recognition that all 11 languages are constitutionally recognized and entrenched and promotion of language is important um so I would definitely inculcate that and encourage us as much as possible to make sure that we write judgments in the language that people understand um and maybe not just judgment writing um people proceedings in court could happen in the language of the people that are there if all speak the same language but I understand the issue of cost because of the translations that have to be done for purposes of an appeal and all that kind of thing but but we should work around those things in order for us not to lose sight of the promotion of language thank you Justice You're excused thank you thank you chief justice and the Commissioners I appreciate the opportunity for e e thank you I should look good afternoon uh chief justice and good afternoon commissioner how are you I'm well chief justice and you I'm fine thanks uh you are from my neck of the woods you come from the Eastern Cape of course chief justice and you studied at my albata the University of trans Skai of course I am from unra where you obtained two degrees a b Rec and lb yes uh did you proceed to work there you your CV says you worked as a legal assistant uh as sorry at the lawyers for human rights where where was that um if I may start by saying when I first um went to University of trans Sky there was an office of lawyers for human rights that was at um I I can't remember the the street name inata inata it was um headed by Miss Dennis Rudolph at that time so miss Dennis Rudolph used to go to the university of trans Skai to uh educate or train students about what human rights are for so I then cultivated a relationship with that office and I still remember in my very first year I asked Miss Rudolph whether I I could uh come to the office and uh do voluntary work during uh school holidays because I was interested in the human rights law then you you were a regional distribution coordinator with the independent forum for electoral education yes what what what what did you do there it was it was during the time when we were preparing for the first democratic election in South Africa so lawyers for human rights had so many um projects at that time so um we were busy with voter education as students were busy with so many things under the umbrella of lawyer for human rights so I was busy with voter education for almost every magisterial District of trans Sky I traveled trans Sky throughout H that is building up to the general election in 1994 all right then you were a legal advisor at M and Associates but for a very brief spell I I I liked doing um vocational work even then also I wanted to gain some experience in litigation I would ask uh the the the directors that can I come to your office and do some voluntary work mostly I got in into those office by doing voluntary work but by the time the the the the the time comes for me to leave and go back to University out get some stipend or something yeah you then you returned to lawyers for human rights who I I I built I built a a a a a very solid relationship with the lawyers for human rights because that's where I started that's where I I cut my teeth as a lawyer that's where I was told that a lawyer never writes with a blue pen a lawyer uses a black pen to write and you just decided that you were going to join the sideb and you went and did your articles and started practicing yes definitely at gako Incorporated at um Owen Street you worked for the a number of firms including the women's Legal Center where was that in Cape Town in Cape Town yes and joined the State Attorneys Office yes as a senior assistant State Attorney I started as an assistant then I was promoted you were there for 9 years well you say between 2002 2 and March 2011 I counted yes yes right that's correct and you decided to start your own practice yes I started my own practice where I dealt with some um commercial work I still remember I used to do contracts for companies um that had businesses uh in in some African countries like Zambia and and laka so I was I was busy with commercial contracts during that time and where did you open this office in Cape Town in Cape Town I I practiced from home at that that time yeah you're very brave I must say when I was offered an opportunity to work there I I couldn't wait to to to run away and go back home not everybody um can withstand what is happening in the western care all right you you you you your life as a soul solo practitioner was shortly because you started acting yes I thought I was going to practice for quite some time but the former JP said I must I must stay on uh until I was appointed I thought I was breaking away from government now to start my legal practice but it it never ended like that yeah I see that you started acting as a judge in April 2011 and you never went back yes I only went back during reses all right my practice and you were permanently appointed in 2013 in February you've acted at the sca as well yes when between June and September this year all right it was just for that one time yeah how did you find that experience no the the experience was um fulfilling uh things are done much different from the high court and I must say I've learned a lot to take back to the high court and also things that we thought were correct that we should correct at the at the high court level I see that you you've done a lot of things you've served in various committees and uh and and boards in addition to running your own practice so Administration work is is is familiar with it I've done a lot of administration work it's only at the high court that was never given an opportunity to do that yeah I was going to ask about that I take it to you one of the most senior judges in your division uh there are senior judges before me yeah no no I understand that but you are not low level you are somewhere I'm not low level no no I'm not low level have you been given an opportunity to act uh in in the leadership position pertinently as as as as an acting uh Deputy judge president I thought that was something that I was going to address later on okay when I'm dealing with my vision perhaps okay no that's fine yeah that's fine all right uh the professional bodies generally speak well your reviews are are fair um the GCB says your an assessment of your judgment shows that you understand uh legal Concepts including constitutional law yes but then they mention a judgment of yours they and the Law Society of South Africa which you you you served at some stage yes I served at the lssa yes they they mention a judgment is it La against commission yes I think I I sent a response in as far as that is concerned no I just wanted to raise something with you about I'm not concerned that you overend by the conal court with few if any judge will claim that they have not been overend on appeal at some stage uh what I wanted to raise with you is a concern uh uh raised by the Law Society that you omitted to mention that judgment in your questionnaire I omitted to include it in my question because I was not aware of it it I completed my question otherwise I I had nothing to hide yes all right uh you mentioned the vision I'm I'm salivating let's let's hear this V vision for for your court okay uh let me start uh by um advising this commission that I was nominated to this position at the time when I Was preparing to take my acting stint at the Supreme Court of Appeal it came as a surprise to me but I had to to to to um agree to to to to serve because I'm already serving as a judge in any event so I'm going to start by telling this uh commission why do I think I'm the right person for this position I've prepared something in writing I don't know whether you want to read it yes I would like to you you may do that I find that that saves time yeah after I had an opportunity to observe different leadership styles from different leaders leaders that I served under I'm convinced that mine is slightly different from others besides being a Visionary and a strategic leader I think transparency holistic approach on matters welcoming spirit and inclusivity is key to successful leadership I would classify myself as a born leader because I chased opportunities to lead throughout uh my my my young days up until now from my teenage years at the University of trans Skai I saw myself with some few students establishing a student body that was called students for human rights during those years this body did so well in conscientia community of the former transy region in educating them about their basic human rights and their right to vote closer to the first democratic election in 1994 as young students we undertook this task diligently although we did not have any Bill of Rights at the time our source document that we use was the the universal Declaration of Human Rights that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948 the establishment of that student body was a success which prepared the less privileged H adequately for our democracy this initiative would not have been possible without the support of the lawyers for human rights and later on funding came from the University of trans Sky despite being the youngest in the group then my thought leadership and transformational commitment was well embraced by all involved shortly after I obtained my degrees I joined the black Lawyers Association which at the time did not have a student body in the former trans Sky I and my former colleagues who were candidate Attorneys at the time were task with the formation of the bla Student Chapter as we were fresh uh from University and still had contacts on campus this initiative was well received by student who aligned themselves with the bla objectives regrettably I had to leave Matata before its launch as I received a work opportunity as a director at prel oring Incorporated in Cape Town once more when I arrived in Cape Town the culture was different to what I was used to in Matata there was close to no or organizational structure that I could identify or associate with for instance there were two or three people who identified themselves as members of the black livw Association but there was no organizational structure in place I remember after having a meeting with Advocate D who shared the same sentiments that uh we need to uh form a a body a structure of the b a in in the in the in the Western Cape we decided that I will mobilize people who are interested to join the organization and put formal structures in place in our first meeting I still remember Advocate Z I was elected as a branch chairperson and I was elected as a secretary Secretary General the organization grew slowly throughout the years and when H Advocate Zea relocated to Johannesburg I led the organization as a branch chairperson I grew in this organization has served and served the bla at the NC level on more than one term to this day I owe it to this organization for nurturing my leadership press this is the organization that deployed me to various structures where I led at uh different leadership roles like being a counselor at the cape Law Society and the Law Society of the South Africa in addition I served as a board member at the at the South African board for for sheriffs and which at that time we found it in disarray however by the end of our term as the board all systems were in place and I assisted in setting up its disciplinary department and I chaed the disciplinary Committee of the sheriffs I must say I gained much um leadership uh uh leadership uh um sorry I gained uh much experience in leadership when I was at the state ATT tenes for those years and also when I ran my practice as a solo practitioner although I had somebody who was assisting me at the time for these reasons I would find no difficulty in giving a strategic and jurisprudential direction to the division I must say that I've mentored many acting judges in my division in judgment writing and in case management some of them did exceptionally well under my guidance and have now been appointed permanently I interact with my colleagues and staff in general rual well I'm forri right in my Approach and I'm also time conscious and I'm not scared in getting my hands dirty I can say safely say that I classify myself as a diligent and hard worker who's not afraid to lead from the front my in my interest in imparting skills to others is not only Li limited to the bench I do talks on relevant topics to students disadvantaged communities government institutions mostly during races also I still do the bla I still uh offer training at the BL trial advocacy training during resar I do this training to law students and to the legal practitioners at this point I must pause and say that I am a human being in and at times I would make mix mistakes so this means that I'm not averse to criticisms if I make mistakes I take I take kindly to constructive constructive criticism and take it as an opportunity to correct my mistakes and appreciate and understand issues differently also in times of disagreement and with my calm and strong demeanor I'm able to diffuse tension or conflict quickly before it escalates to something uncontrollably I always think that communication is key to any kind of relationship transparency in communication and collegiality is something that should always be fostered at all times I believe with with all that said I am available for this task as I possess relevant leadership qualities the fact that I have not acted in this position should not be put at my doorstep as the acting criteria in these positions is not clear from where the Western Cape is Western Cape high court is currently it requires strategic and Visionary leadership and I'm mindful of the fact that this is a view I formed from being a judge in that division for a considerable number of years despite that being the case I've stated that I have not acted in the management in I have not acted in a management capacity in that Court as the criteria remains unclear however I must point out from the outset that the situation is not easy as one would see or as it appears there are serious Dynamics at play in the Western Cape High Court one might say for instance I would ensure that all the colleagues attend T room they go to judges lunches they attend judges meetings but I don't think that would be a solution from the for the for status so with that being said I would like to share my 10o plan if appointed as JP I would like to implement first number one I would start with uh addressing relations two visibility of the leader in the division that is the judge president herself number three skewed patterns of allocation of work four transparency in the location of second courts five modernization of court and virtual hearings six access to courts seven shortage of judges and tools of trade eight transparency in the appointment of acting judges nine efficiency in utilizing uh Court time and 10 m maintenance of stakeholder relations more especially in the lower courts with regard to the relations in an environment where trust relation relations between colleagues have broken down for years in my view it would assist to get an opinion from a specialized individual on workplace relations to First conduct an assessment and give us aort report on what remedial measures need to be implemented that's for stus because as I'm sitting here I don't know what what is the problem in the Western Cape coupled with that is the perception that some colleagues due to their backgrounds perhaps not originating from the Western Cape are not supposed to be judges in that court I consider these first two critical issues as delicate and of utmost importance and could not be simply ignored or be resolved by a relationship coach or a diversity training Workshop uh in a one day session perhaps these might be those might be relevant at a later at a later stage but not now we need to identify we need to zoom in into the into the pro pro problem right now however on the other hand I must point out that the situation is not that ominous the Western Cape High Court Prides itself with judges who are committed to their oath of office and are always hard at work whatever relationship issues that might be there they have not affected the work output in fact this is the compliment that we always receive from colleagues from uh higher courts that is from colleagues from the Supreme Court of Appeal and colleagues from the Constitutional court number two I'm going to deal with the visibility visibility of the judge president as I've stated earlier in a division that has trust issues it is my my opinion that there should be visible leadership what makes relations to be strained in that in is that judges are reluctant to open up for that trust to be regained for status the lines of communication with the management should be open and clear having identified these areas of concern once communication lines are open it is my strong view that judges would have confidence in their leader for instance judges sometimes do experience work and personal challenges while executing their duties for instance if judge if a judge approaches a judge president for whatever reason that might be there or concern such conversation should remain between the two confidence is of atmost importance and should be key one other example if an email is sent to the judge president that email should be responded to promptly it is the role of the judge president to administer the day-to-day Affairs of the division efficiently and that invariably includes issues that are delicate enough and should not be responded to by the judge president's register or secretary I'm acutely aware that secretaries are there or a secretary is is there to support the office of the judge president but there are issues that are sensitive personal and operational in nature that are not supposed to be addressed to the judge by a secretary it is therefore my plan to recognize acknowledge and give consideration to my colleagues stakeholders litigant in general should I get the note in order to gain and maintain confidence on my colleagues and the staff in general I will Implement an open door policy more inter interaction in forging healthy relations in the form of discussing and uh sharing sessions perhaps sharing a sharing session that would be planned on a certain uh Friday afternoon sharing sessions on new judgments at least once per month reinstatement of Judges lunches I don't know whether judges can afford judges lunches given the fact that given the state of their salaries currently also judges meeting and end of fear functions would at least help to to to to mend the relations in the division because there be that ongoing type of an interaction I will also ensure that the information from other structures like the peec heads of Court meetings the ocj that affect the division is reported back to the judges for discussion and resolutions to be taken as a collective I'm now going to go to the third point Equitable allocation of work for quite some time now there has been a discontentment in how the work is allocated in our division by way of an example most permanent judges are working between unopposed motion court and Criminal Court currently matters of substance especially civil matters and high profile matters are allocated only to Selected Few permanent judges and on ad hoc or pro bono acting judges or acting judges who are appointed from the ranks of of uh from the r ranks of The Advocates profession for instance certain judges have been privileged to be allocated to be allocated cases that enhances and develop the Juris Prudence whereas others receive none of that sort I'm fully aware that perhaps that might be a strategy on uh on the part of the management to address the issue of the backlog but it is my strong view that expertise and experience of permanent judges in my view is not something that is normally taken into consideration when uh work allocation in both criminal and civil matters is done coincidentally this does nothing to recognize the diversion skills that are possessed by by the members of the court I mean permanent judges so permanent judges remain in criminal court for years this by no means should be taken as downplaying the criminal court work or trivializing the work of some judges over the others however the truth is the truth is that the jurisprudential strong points of permanent judges should be recognized and nurtured throughout their careers at the bench in future this would create a pool from which the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court could draw acting judges from I'm mindful of the fact that we still have backlogs and backlogs are still going to remain with us for quite some time at the same time the reduction of case backlock cannot be addressed by removing permanent judges for about 3 years from the Civil pool some sort of balance in my view should always be maintained this is not only detrimental to the judges who lose touch completely with that area of law also it causes difficulty to Advocates who deal with these uh voluminous and complex matters for instance when they revert back to their practices at the end of their stins it causes delays with the handing down of the judgments as they have to juggle between successfully operating their practices and or working on their Reserve judgments in my view to ensure that permanent judges are upskilled and an expertise is created amongst its rank if appointed I'll ensure that an equitable distribution of work amongst colleagues is maintained the uneven allocation of work should not be a weapon to settle scores and or to stifle the growth of others on the bench in addition when a motion court is allocated to certain Duty judges it should be finalized by the said Duty judges and not be reallocated to judges who are not part of that Duty by so doing a perception would be created that other judges are favored and or are shielded from heavy lifting now going to deal with my four fourth Point transparency in allocation of second courts previously when I joined the bench the allocation of uh Second Court was done by order of seniority however lately there seems to be no criteria at all on how they are located some senior judges monopolize certain secet courts and in some instances Junior judges are given preference over senior judges I think also a clear Criterion should be put in place to the fact that for instance a duty roster of Judges due to go on second should be kept and updated at all all times no judge should go on second on Second Court on two consecutive terms or for the whole year for that matter as it current as it as it it's currently done a judge should spend at least one term at second court and thereafter rever to the division should a matter or matters not be finalized on an allocated time it should be transferred back to the court or behe virtually and be finalized as soon as possible also I found that there's a problem in as far as the current demarcation of secet courts are concent some something needs to be done or the second Court demarcation needs to be relooked at as in my view some existing courts are not located where the people are or where the people are concentr concentrated judging from the way the amount of work is increasing second costs should be designated for both civil and criminal work and not only be criminal work orientated by so doing this should assist in bringing Justice to the people I'll deal now with modernization of Courts and visual sorry and and virtual hearings this project was first touted even before covid-19 hit the world however its roll out out has happened at a s snail pace and I understand that training by Mambo JP happened for this first first time in our division a month ago and even then I don't think that was enough to upskill the full compliment in the division some ongoing training training on case lines and V virtual courts need to be done as a proponent of an online court and one of the first judges that received training from virtual platforms when covid-19 hit I think virtual hearings are the most efficient way in finalizing cases expeditiously I know Lambo JP has always offered his services in so far as the JP has already offered his services in so far as training is concerned but this new innovation has not in my view received the embrace it deserves in my observation the older judges are not keen in learning new ways of doing things should I be offered this opportunity to Le the division I'll ensure that filing online and reverting back to Virtual hearings is in is introduced gradually or incrementally so as not to overwhelm those who are not keen on trying new things in fact it should be in introduced in such a way that all would buy to it for instance virtual hearings have proved to be quicker and efficient in agent matters more especially in after hours duties and unopposed motions this is by no means evinced that open court should be done away with however this Innovation will need support rep from the office of the Chief Justice I must stress that if judges do not have functional laptops and they don't have they do not have access to a stable Network or for instance ocj pays limited amount of of time when making subscri subscriptions or buying licenses from service providers to access the network this strategy would be fule exercise I'll now deal with the access to court section uh 34 of the Constitution guarantees access to courts to all there is a perception out there that courts are only accessed by those with Deep Pockets this is evident on the caliber or types of litigant that we encounter in our courts on a daily basis even though the legal aid board had uh previously broadened their scope in terms of matters it covers it also faces some challenges in the sense that their budget has been cut that will also Cil a number of underprivileged liant uh from accessing more especially the high court coupled coupled with this is the geographical loc location of the high court for instance the Western Cape high court is not easily accessible from the people who are coming from the most disadvantaged locations or backgrounds and in my view this remains a huge challenge the lack of means is evident when one deals with the unopposed Motions or a criminal trial it is either that the litigant or Witnesses come late to court because of challenges with the transport and find out that their matters have already been de been dealt with or do not have or do not come to court at all because of the reasons related to shortages of funds in my view this problem could be partly addressed if for instance a criminal matter originates from KY and the accused and Witnesses are all from that area an at hoc Second Court could be created in kyisha magistrates Court to deal with such matters so as to eliminate the strain of traveling on those persons this would only be a temporal measure until the location of Second Court in our jurisdiction is revised as I've pointed out earlier on I recently understood that uh for instance for legal practitioners uh license to be renewed with the LPC that is legal practice Council they are compelled to have done a stipulated number of pro Bonner work at a certain period of time if the legal practice Council as a stakeholder could share a list of practitioners who have not done the number of hours a judge on duty for instance could refer unrepresented litigants to these or to those attorneys the Capa also used to have a pro bono Advocate readily available in court I'm not sure whether that is still the case it is my strong view that legal services and access to courts should be open and accessible to all citizens of this country I'll now deal with the shortage of judges and tools of trate the reason why we have this constant backlog is that currently there is a shortage of Judges that has been underscored by various judges from various divisions I've heard this time and time again this problem has been there even before I joined the bench as a judge it is not clear whether this situation will remain or change would happen at some point it is not even clear whether judges should get used to working under these pressurized conditions as the situation cannot be changed as a result most judges end up getting sick due to stress they encounter on a daily basis let's take for example if the Western Cape high court is allocated six to 10 judges tomorrow do we have space to accommodate them in the form of Chambers Court and staff not at all the court the courts around the country in general seems to be carrying more challenges than Solutions this at that judges do not have updated law reports in their Chambers they even find login challenges to their online platforms that ocj has subscribed on that is Lexus Nexus and Twitter this pose even greater challenges with the limited staff compliment of legal researchers most daunting I'm now speaking for myself I have been standing on the queue for the past 3 years for a new laptop that has forever been promised that is on its way I would at this point implore the office of the Chief Justice to ensure that at least judges are provided with the basic tools of trade to ensure that they function optimally The Strain is even more if judges have to be burdened with the lack of resources to do their work even if there are austerity measures in place judges deserve to be provide provided with tools of plate to deliver on their obligations as mandated by the norms and standards next Point transparency in the appointment of acting judges it has always been said that the current process of appointing acting judges is shrouded susceptible to abuse and patronage I'm not sure whether that is correct however I'm acutely aware that the former Minister of Justice that is Justice Ronald L lamula introduced a policy to ensure transparency and fairness in the appointment of acting judges despite this being the case it is my view that all the members of the legal profession should be given a fair opportunity to put their skills into test it cannot be that the same faces show up all the time when calls for when calls are made for acting judges in fact should I be appointed I think a committee should be uh put in place that is ched by the judge president to screen and identify potential candidates in the broader legal profession in line with transformation init initiatives to act as judges on the one hand I would ensure that senior judges who are eager to train and Mentor acting judges are identified for the success of the division in retaining skills as uh more judges who are experienced have now um retired uh uh the next point is strategy to utilize uh C time efficiently in light of our of our backlog currently and shortages of and shortage of Judges I intend to devise a strategy to use the court time efficiently for example councel and legal practitioners should stick to to the allocated time either by the courts by the court itself or um the time that they have reflected in their practice note in so doing allocations of two to three short matters per judge per day would be possible should Council stick to this allocated time for instance arguments should only be limited in issues of dispute Council should not be allowed to read the whole head heads of arguments as the other parties would inadvertently have read the record timelessly also in order not to put strain on the long list of Reserve judgments and also to start the new term on a cleans slate I envisage the last week of ter to be used to utilize or to be utilized by the judges to catch up with their Reserve judgment and any other previously allocated work that remained unfinished to be finalized in that last week so that when the new terms starts the court starts on a clean slate my last point is the m maintenance of relations with the stakeholders and magistrates Court I do understand that uh there is an ongoing relationship between the judge president and the stakeholders and the stakeholders stakeholder relations should be maintained at PC level on an ongoing basis we all understand that the coordination of all judicial functions of magistrates Court fall within the jurisdiction of the high court and it is the responsibility of the Judgment of the sorry of the judge president to to coordinate uh those relations also I'm mindful of the fact that magistrates Court they operate at Under animous Pressure to dispense Justice at an entry level of of the Judiciary um in my preparation for this interview I stumbled across a a report that was prepared by the public protector dated um 4th June 2024 so in the interest of time I want uh really go through what the public protector identified as problems it seems that the problems are all the all all the same in that the prop protor identifi that there's a shortage of resources at the magistrates court and it seems also issues with regard to domestic violence are not taken care of by the magistrates and also magistrates themselves have reported that they have been victims of um sexual harassment by their colleagues and H this is about 16% of women M magistrate who who voice that uh opinion so if magistrates have been um victims of gender violence victims of gbv gender based violence themselves how are they going to make sure let me start by say if if the the the the the women magistrates have been victims of gender based violence without any uh any any any intervention in the form of counseling being done to them are they going to be able to do justice to the cases that come before them also if the male magistrates are found to be the perpetrators of this gender based violence that is sexual harassment are they going to do justice to the matters that come before them involving sexual harassment that is my um my question another problem that was identified by the public protector was the issue of bribery and Corruption but that one uh she didn't have any um mandate and or capacity to investigate because it's beyond um her scope is criminal in nature and also there's lack of security in the magistrates Court so if I'm appointed as a judge president I would make sure that I do interact with the lower court in order to see to it that I support them in as far as their challenges are concerned the public protector in his sorry in her report concluded that Court infrastructure resources and staff conditions are Det ating and there needs to be some improvement it is without a doubt that also the lower courts experience H huge uh backlogs due to covid-19 so what should be done in such matters so it would assist to interact with the magistrates more to to to to to get a feel as to what is it that needs to be H attended to as of priority I would also make sure that I identify all these court within my jurisdiction who suffer from these hardships and support them and see as to how we can better mitigate these challenges depending on the nature thereof in conclusion I must say that judging from the support and messages received from my colleagues and from the support staff of the Western Cape high court from last week up until this morning I do enjoy support of the majority of them and I would have no problem in working with any one of them that's my presentation thank you judge M judge gambo thank you CJ judgment Tommy uh amongst your Lany of complaints was the question of the allocation of work um and did I understand you to say that that there's an inequitable allocation of work that some people are getting interesting cases and others not was that your complaint it's not only my complaint is the complaint that I've heard from many of my colleagues as well well I I want to just have a look at barard laas again that was a very complicated tax matter that was allocated to you mhm am I correct it was a it was a problematic tax matter perhaps it was problematic um it went to the Constitutional Court in judgment was delivered there in 2022 Volume 5 which means towards the end of 2022 um but you say you never you never knew that the case went to the Constitutional court and I I I didn't pick it up have you since read the Judgment I did are you aware of the of of the strid and criticism of your approach um in the Judgment of Judge Rogers yes I I I did uh see the criticism also I don't know whether you've read my judgment speak pardon I'm not aware whether you've read my judgment no no I'm asking about whether you whether you've read the Judgment of the Constitutional Court which criticized you for your failure to apply one of the basic rules of our law that's staro decises yes and that you ignored president yes I've I've I've I've I've seen that criticism and do you understand the criticism yep then there's further criticism I'm simply looking at what the GCB had to say with further criticism that you uh dismissed a constitutional challenge which was made in the alternative um without even considering it are you aware of that yes I'm aware of it that's why I was asking if did you uh at least have a look at my judgment before no I didn't I'm I'm asking you about the criticism of the constition in my judgment I said that matter was capable of being uh determined without reaching a constitutional point on the issue of circuit courts um you suggest that there's an inequitable distribution of circuit courts but you know that not inequitable as such it needs a revision because Jud judge just ask you to be patient with judge gamble as we have been patient with you okay let him finish his question thank you chief justice circuit courts in in in our division are advertised at the the beginning the end of every term sorry the beginning of the term the circuit courts for the next term are advertised colleagues are invited to apply sorry circuit courts are advertised so for instance now at the beginning of this term the circuit courts for uh the beginning of next year the first term in January first term in 2025 they will be advertised and and colleagues apply I've applied but I've never been given a chance to go to Second Court but they are advertised it's not a question of them just being dished out but if if you put your name down you would be told that someone has taken it much more Junior than than you the you you speak about promotion of collegiality and you speak about um promoting that culture in the t- room when when ni did you to attend the t- room in the high court I can't remember do you you at one stage were working from home quite a lot do you spend all of your time at the cape high court or do you still work from home when was that b you pardon when was that that I was working from home no I'm asking a number of colleagues during during Co and after Co worked from home I'm simply asking do you spend all of your time at the cape iport or do you still work from home I don't know how to to to respond to that question because I'm not sure which period are you asking for I can't I can't just respond without knowing which period I referring to whether it was during Co or after everybody went back to the building no no postco postco I went to the building when everybody went back to the building and then lastly you appreciate a judge M Tomi that if you if you get the job you inherit um a deputy judge president who's already there and who is going to be there on her Reckoning for at least another 5 years that that will you will you will inherit a judge president in the person of of Judge Goliath you appreciate that me do will you be able to work with her I think so I don't have any problems with the well judge president currently the reason I'm asking is because I recall a judge's meeting not too long ago when you accused her of dishonesty in the face of other judges in in an open meeting you know the the meeting I'm talking about I didn't accuse her of dishonesty I still remember you intervened and you asked her to to to to investigate the matter and the matter I don't think it was really investigated to start with well maybe our Recollections are different but I do recall that there was it was investigated but the the outcome was the same as what happened at the the meeting if if you want me to put it like that that's why I'm saying I don't think it was investigated because we filed statements as to how the issues turned out but I don't think those issues were even taken into consideration by the ajp but you say not withstanding that um that interaction you would have no difficulty in working with her not not at all I do go to her Chambers every now and then when I've got a problem thank you chief justice thank you judge gamble I allowed you to continue with your questioning but the thing is we don't know what you're talking about and practice uh in this body is that if you're going to raise uh an issue of concern with a candidate you you foror them and this body so that they have a chance to to to to to respond and we have this body has a chance to determine if that objection has any legs it it should be it should be allowed but then you wouldn't know you that's why I gave you leway yes my apologies chief justice I was responding to to the statement of of the intent that the judge put forward I was responding to the issues that she raised in her statement of intent all right but my apologies for over spping the mark no that's fine uh Mr bov thank you chief justice uh afternoon judge Momi good afternoon commissioner um just on the on the judge Jud M um I note your reply that you said look you weren't aware of it at the time of your application um but that judgment was handed down more than two years ago so we would you agree that your I mean given your position as a judge and the expectation I suppose from people who appear before you and the general public that judges know the law that there's an expectation that you you or keep yourself a breast of developments in the legal landscape and especially when it comes to judgments of the higher courts yes I do I do and especially given their binding nature on the lower courts yes so does your explanation not admit to shortcoming in that regard not at all because sometimes you get to know about your own judgment when you're researching a certain point when you're preparing a judgment you don't always follow up on every each and every matter that you've granted leave to appeal on once the matter leaves your desk there are so many things or there are so many matters that a judge should H attend to the high court the the the work is moving very no no sure I take the point um I think my point is rather that regardless of whether you actively follow up on your own judgments there are services in which the the various courts and um circulate judgments on a daily basis to those who subscribe to them so it's very accessible especially with safle being open open source facility what I'm saying is that in the normal course of um familiarizing yourself with the latest judgments of the higher courts you should have come across this judgment and said hey wait but that that looks familiar I remember that case and and what I'm saying is your explanation perhaps reveals a shortcoming in that regard in the general um continuous um updating of yourself with the developments in the law yes I do update myself in the development of of the law I check all the cases that are are delivered for instance by the Supreme Court of Appeal and by the by the concort only if those matters are reported I don't know whether this matter was was a reported judgment but I didn't pick up that it was a reported judgment hence it it skipped my mind or it skipped my my daytoday uh looking at the recent decisions that have been uh delivered by by higher courts okay thank you judge thank you C commissioner thank you very much CJ I just want to ask two questions quickly and then I'll tell you why I'm asking those questions what what is your understanding of a Judicial temperament judicial temperament it it it uh requires that a judge uh should be able to listen and uh take into into consideration other people's views and be collegial to to others and not act outside of what is required of a judge what is to understanding of collegiality is that colleagues should be uh should have Rel relations good relations and should be able to work well with others so when I walked in here the CJ was still conducting the interview and the way you were responding to her um at the beginning I thought maybe the C CJ explained your relations before I came in and maybe you know each other from some somewhere else because you kept on interjecting her and not allowing her to finish her points I was like does she have a problem with her or1 but you do that to your colleague again this side and this time you don't do to her you do it to your colleague she says to you no wait until he has finished his point but that's what you've been doing to her do you define that you are the one who just said to me now judicial temperament means that you must listen to others but here you have to be stopped for you to listen to others interject the most highest office when it interviews you is that a true reflection of judicial temperament and collegiality at this level in in public commissioner malma I didn't see that as an interjection I thought the Chief Justice had finished her questions and also I thought um commissioner gamble had finished his questions if I have interjected I do apologize it was not my intention to interject thank you CJ thank you commissioner commissioner thank you thank you uh CJ good afternoon uh J mandami good afternoon commissioner yes just just one from my side the you you did mention that uh you it's easy for you to interact with the acting judge president uh upon that is the question that was posed by judge cbell so now the question that I want to pose is given the key areas that you have raised as part of your vision and with the relationship that you have painted around the dire situation of permanent charges uh in terms of uh secet courts the question that I want to pose is uh I get an impression that it will tell me if I'm I'm not correct I get an impression that uh there is no platform by judges to raise this key uh areas that you have uh highlighted as problematic areas that has to be fixed uh that are that are captured as part of your vision going forward is my impression correct you might be correct commissioner because I raised them with the ajp and I raised them with the adjp and I guess you not the only one that have raised them and the in the meetings that are not minuted but notes are taken I get that all these issues were raised in those meetings not in in a meeting I raised them by via email or verbally sometimes thank thank you J thank you CJ uh commissioner M good good afternoon good good evening uh judge M good good good evening commissioner yes earlier on we were told that the Fallout between um the then JP and the current ajp had actually led to serious problems in the division and um those would be some of the things that you would then need to deal with should you be appointed to this position but then the question that I would want to ask you in relation to skewed allocation and uh second allocation do you think that there are Judges that are being favored as a result of the positions that they've taken in relation to the Fallout between the then JP and the current AGP the short answer would be yes I think so so you there are divisions in the division I'm not sure about the divisions in the division but the there are there are critical issues in the division thank you chief justice me follow up just on this question you say there are critical issues in the division the first one that was highlighted it would seem to miss favoritism can you tell us what are the iCal I don't because when you say they are critical issues we don't know what are they what according to you um commissioner I don't know whether I should talk about individuals in this commission that are being f favored or there's a perception that they are being favored but there is that perception without calling names yeah please don't mention names we may pass on from the question in fact no we may pass off on from question because my understanding was there is favoritism that that one could and then I understand to saying there are critical issues not necessar that I didn't understand that to be names I I was maybe thinking what is this critical point issue but now if we are not comfortable can pass on What's that question commissioner Stan uh good evening judge uh manami good evening commissioner I'm going back to the laisak Judgment when judge gamble asked you about uh this the Constitutional court judgment you responded by saying have you read my judgment and I have two questions in that regard are you implying that the Constitutional Court got it wrong and your judgment was right not at all commissioner what I wanted to to clarify is that perhaps the case that was put at the Constitutional court is not the case that I was confronted with that's all well I'd like to probe that the the Constitutional Court said on the issue of um the um the resend ability of tax judgments it says that all the authorities which has said those are final judgments and are ascendable were brought to your attention but you ignored them and didn't follow precedent now that seems to be correct from a reading of your judgment and the Constitutional Court's judgment so what about that was not before you you would remember that Med cash de dealt with the vets with the vat Tax Act the matter that was before me dealt with the tax administration act the M cach was decided in 2000 uh the judgments that I relied on were provincial uh divisions that were recent and some of them spoke on what was happening in that matter that they referred to the tax act to the TAA so the tax act TAA in my view was addressed more better in the recent judgments of the provincial division in the in the in the in the in the judgments of the provin provincial divisions that's than what was at play in the medc remember medc did didn't do deal with the with the rentability of civil judgments uh the con Court in that matter dealt with the Declaration of sections sections of the vet act unconstitutional well the court here also comments that you didn't explain that you didn't actually distinguish you you didn't take into account a whole lot of authority and you didn't explain what youve just plan now which I think is correct yeah that's why I said I I do accept that criticism my I sorry no no carry on because my judgment was not thsu it it came from uh presidents from the provincial division my second question also relates to answer to to judge Gamble and following on from commissioner malma when he asked you about um the constit Constitutional court judgment and you said well have you read mine do you think that displays collegiality and an appropriate judicial temperament I thought um by asking that question it was going to have a balance on what was before me and what what was dealt with by the Constitutional Court I didn't in any manner try to disrespect judge gamble thank you follow up CJ uh good afternoon judge I'm here good afternoon commissioner yes I just want to follow up on the laar Judgment um my understanding of of that judgment uh first and foremost um Rogers J um was not conclusive in in in his statement he say you appear to have uh not relied on on President that's the first point he was not conclusive about the issue but that's not the point he he actually referred to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal or the appell division the 1973 app division case the krua case and in in in in his reasoning he says that in fact in that particular case the appell division stated it categorically that tax judgments were reable and that is the the basis upon which the criticism is based I'm not sure do do you have any comment on that I've seen the Judgment that it started analyzing judgments from 1965 those judgments were not before me when the matter was argued it was only met cash that was put uh before me but was the issue whether a tax judgment can be resed an issue before you yes but surely that is an issue that can be that can be researched uh it might be that the parties themselves or none of them actually argue the case before you but I think if there is Authority from a higher Court um then one would expect um that at least that Authority is is located unless perhaps there there's a challenge with resources in terms of research and and so I think that's where uh Rogers J was coming from commissioner the reason perhaps maybe I might have appeared hostile in asking whether judge gamble read my judgment the case that was before me was not clear to start with from the applicants the applicants didn't know which uh instrument to rely on firstly it was said the obligation is brought in terms of uh um uniform rule 322 capital B there's no uniform rule dealing with rentability of judgments in as far as that rule is concerned secondly they said they brought the application in terms of rule 42 thirdly they said they brought the application in terms of common law I was confronted with those three legal instruments and I had to analyze them all as to which one would be relevant in their case it seems as if their case was all clear before the the Constitutional that's why I'm saying I don't know which case was put before the the Constitutional court because the papers were in shambles when they came before me but I do take that today the the criticism is is is is is on me it was not a a good drafted application that I dealt with no no I can accept that a case evolves with time and sometimes when it get to the con Court it becomes better better explained I can accept that thank you very much CJ and even wrong legal instruments were quoted and I had to to probe during the hearing which rule 32 are you referring to are you referring to 312 small B that deals with thanks I think you you have made a point and I think I agree with you thank you much it was a bad case that I had to deal with M uh Mr commissioner commissioner n yes thank you chief justice um Jud M I just want to come back to this point that you were discussing with commissioner Steinberg on the SL judgment because I'm very worried about the way you've characterized the criticism of the Constitutional court because it's seems there's one issue that they take with your judgment which is whether or not you are correct that a tax judgment is not final and therefore not rescindable do you accept that yes because that was my finding yes now on that issue it doesn't matter whether they characterize it as a rule 32 or any other rule because it's a question of law now what they say about what you did is that you failed to have regard to at least three judgments uh that were binding on the issue despite the fact that those judgments had been brought to your attention in fact it's only in the leave to appeal where you referred to metk and the way you did so at paragraph 29 of the Constitutional court judgment you said that the Constitutional Court did not make a finding of law it just made an observation this is why they use very strong language to say that your judgment was unacceptable is because you poo pooed you dismissed you waved away a binding Authority that says a tax judgment is final that's the criticism against you in other words you treated authority of the Constitutional Court as if it didn't exist so you can find that in the Judgment itself at paragraph 29 n they come back to that at paragraph 30 they say the reasoning in medc now now they're responding to you on reability was not merely an observation it was an integral part of this Court's reasoning and medk in turn endorsed the two judgments in krugger so that gives us three that were brought to you you don't apply them despite the fact that the conc cour has spoken authoritatively of on the subject now my concern is not so much whether you get the job of being JP it is what you will do when you return as a judge bearing in mind the posture you've adopted today about the authority of the Constitutional Court can you comment on that uh commissioner I'm not sure what uh attitude I've adopted about the Constitutional Court you've said it was a different case before the con Court to the case that was before you whereas I've just pointed out to you it was exactly the same issue which is finality of tax judgments now once you don't accept that it was the same issue my fear is that you will repeat the same error of treating with dismissiveness judgments of the Constitutional court if I can just finish this point maybe then paragraph 30 says observance of the roles of President is not a display of politeness to a court of higher authority it is a component of the rule of law which is a founding value of the Constitution my fear is that you will not follow president as I said earlier on commissioner toi that I do accept the Judgment of the Concord I do accept that I'm Bound by the Judgment of the Constitutional Court however there was a lot that I had to unscramble in the court of first instance to reach the the decision that I've reached maybe it didn't uh come out clear that I had to unscramble a lot of issues before I came to that conclusion I did not at all not in one minute say that I'm not bound by the president of the Constitutional Court no I I don't think you said you were not bound but the approach we've taken before us is that it's because the applicants failed to identify the issue and therefore the issues were different so in other words you still don't see that there was an error in your judgment because you got the law on finality of tax judgments wrong and that's the point I was putting to you commissioner Toby it's not that I didn't see what was in front of me I was just giving a background as to what is it that I was confronted with I thought that was going to clarify the issue as to why I came to the conclusion I came to not that I I I I want to disrespect or disregard the Judgment of the higher Court Apex court for that matter yes I wanted to give a background no I understand that but the issue is still the same it's whether or not tax judgments are final that's the issue before you that's the issue before the Constitutional court so I'm struggling to understand why this background is relevant to that issue and that's why I fear that you will just repeat the same error commissioner I want to repeat that error I'm I'm I'm committed to that commissioner okay let it pass thank you president M good afternoon my sister Justice maname good afternoon president yes you confirmed that you acted at the Supreme Court of Appeal during the third time so more or less uh for three months correct I do confirm yes and I think you also stated that um um you learned a few positive thing uh things from that acting stint correct yes that is correct yes um I confirm that I think you were in my panel in one or two matters if I'm not mistaken just to give you credit to say that I was satisfied with your level of participation in the conferences um you'll recall that we had a s a session with all the acting justices uh just before your term came to an end and the partying short was that request that um all of you should go and plow back to the courts where you come from do you remember this I still remember that day yes now from your own personal experience what is it that you will be able to plow back based on the experience that you got during your acting stint at the sca um on two occasions that I set with uh another senior judge there were problems in um matters where coming from my court where a full bench would sit as a court of first instance so it caused some problems when it comes to to leave to appeal parties they don't know whether to ask for leave to appeal from the high court or to ask for leave to appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeal mostly they approach the Supreme Court of Appeal of which the Supreme Court of Appeal said it's wrong they should go to the court of first instance and that's one of the of the things that I would take back so if I understand you correctly you are going to offer assistance to your colleagues certainly that perhaps those uh full benches are unwarranted in a situation where the court is going to be the course of court of first instance thank you justice thanks CJ judge president thank you CJ good afternoon judge mandame I'm here good afternoon judge judge president um there's two things from myself one um I Che the last available Reserve judgment reports there were two judges in your court Who had who were owing judgments the period recorded was 22 months and then there are there are others in varying time periods up to 6 months from 22 months 18 months 17 months 16 up to about 6 months if you are appointed as JP how do you propose to help C this problem can I answer judge president yes please firstly I I would identify as to what is the reason for the judgment to be reserved for such a long time and if there are problems I would see where could I assist and also uh implore to the judge consent that he or she should finish the the Judgment as soon as possible because of the norms and standards that we should stick to you know the CJ the the the the outgo CJ CJ zondo threatened the JP is for not reporting judges who owe judgment um I don't hear you mention that I don't know whether they are not reported by the current um uh management or I should also I should have put in my plan that I would report them I'm not certain about a question question well I think my question this is a follow-up question you said I asked you what would you do to assist in terms of addressing this Reserve judgment problems so if you're appointed as JP and you have a judge um say your tracking system fails you and you disc discover after 12 months you discover that there's a judge who owes the Judgment for 12 months what would you do firstly I I I wouldn't understand why the judge president has to leave the Judgment up until it's 12 months old as a reserve judgment because I start panicking with my own judgments when one month passes that time is taking even on the second month I think the Judge president is supposed to impress upon the reserve judgments that they should be finalized 12 months is way out of out of line it's a matter that that should have been reported to the to to to to the Chief Justice at 6 months for that matter as far as I'm concerned yes uh my last question to you is it appears that it is a problem in the Western Cape division in terms of the capacitation of the different roles it looks like there's judges are more allocated towards criminal trials especially when we hear this mention of backlogs than to the Civil part of the role if you are appointed as JP what strategy would you adopt to ensure that there's equitable distribution of judicial resources to ensure that that no work area suffers because of lack of capacitation it is um a fact that a continuous role at least should be maintained at all times judges who are in The Civil pool should rotate and go to to to the criminal pool it's it's inexcusable that there could be judges who stay longer in the in the criminal pool and don't have a feel of what is like to be in the Civil pool for for years currently judges um Carry about two to three matters I mean criminal matters at a goal so I don't think that that is is healthy because it uh it I I don't know whether it is it wants to imitate the way things are done at the magistrates Court magistrates courts they don't have continuous roles for instance you'll find that magistrates do 15 cases per day in the criminal courts I don't want the high court to pretend to be like magistrates in the future thank you very much judge mon thanks CJ thank you very much judge May sorry it's been a long day you're excused thank you chief justice and thank you Commissioners chief justice can I ask you find your classes I do okay I'm I'm wearing them okay okay um on a light note I want to move that the JSC buys us all Red Bulls before the end of the evening CJ didn't hear that but maybe Minister you need to take up this Mandate of getting us energy trigs for all JSC Commissioners and those in the room nothing except to for some e e e e e e e e e e you mind this way thank you for oh my gosh broke did it break are you fine commissioner okay all right good good good good evening uh judge evening chief justice I'm so sorry we kept waiting all day we we not having a particularly good day no that is perfectly in order how are you are surviving CJ well aren we all yeah you have a number of degrees a ba LLB ba Hors and llm and a certificate in international trade law that's that's true uh which ones were obtained uh at the invest of Western Cape it's the ba LLB ba honors all right and the llm from un from unisa and the certificate uh from the University of California UCLA yes which one UCLA D Davis okay you you're an attorney you you proper attorney yes I started off practice as an attorney yes having done your articles in 1980 already yes but you joined the cape bar as Council in 1985 and practiced uh in that capacity for 10 years that is that is correct until 1995 yes then you became a commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996 1995 well your form says 1995 until 2001 yes six years okay then you returned to the bar yes and took silk when did when did you take silk in 1996 okay and uh you were appointed as a judge on a permanent basis in 2022 that's correct in had you acted uh as a judge previously yes many times CJ on aggregate um about five years if if you add it all together so uh you have been a judge uh in in reality for about seven years about seven and a half seven years yeah and where did you act in in the Eastern Cape division of the high court still I I acted initially on a few occasions in the Western Cape where I've always been based uh I've acted in the labor court and I've acted uh the last few stents were in the Eastern Cape okay you sell yourself short in your questionnaire because this don't don't come out clearly I I would have missed this five this important five years you mention because uh the professional bodies are complaining that you are inexperienced and you could benefit yes from uh uh more more more time i' I've noticed it although I don't know I mean you turn 68 in just under twoth under three months so I'm not entirely show what how much more experience one can gain once you become our age yes but in any event yeah I think one must do a bit of a calculation unfortunately I didn't spell it out but the years are there uh for the acting stance so yeah it is important all right um so how many judgments would you say you've produced throughout this period on the bench uh see I would I would say approaching 100 I've I've just done my officer just done a a uh sort of a a sample test uh on the last about 50 Reserve judgments to just see which ones were reportable and of interest and which which ones will not to get sort of a percentage but as I say it should should be approaching 100 m um how many do you know how if any were reported we usually rely on the gcp for for for for for this exercise and they say yeah they did not complete the review yeah yeah I'm not a big one on that uh I that's why I've asked my office to to do that sample uh from that sample of 50 Reserve judgments there were about say 34 35% were reportable and of Interest all right and that's where that's where I part with him I I I I don't really follow them up after that I mean I'm too busy there's no time for that indeed yeah uh and I imagine that there would have been on a wide spectrum of of the law oh yes um okay yeah no no that is that is correct all right uh as I've already alluded to the complaint by some of the professional bodies that the GCB and the Law Society of South Africa yes who say you you don't have sufficient experience for this position you're applying for what would you say to to to to that uh no criticism no I have as I've said I've performed judicial the judicial functions for for that period that I've referred to um I know what the job is about I know what to do uh I enjoy doing it so I don't think that there's a there's an issue around that that I am a novice who don't know where to start uh CJ I've I've spent my my entire professional career in uh attending to uh High Court litigation which is which is the the lifeblood of the uh of the courts so apart from the period that I've been performing judicial functions I've been doing litigation High Court litigation for a few decades do you have any leadership experience with within the the institution the Judiciary that is yeah no not uh not directly in the U in the Judiciary but I have uh any leadership experience no no no I haven't I haven't occupied a a position uh as a uh a leadership position in the in judiciary no okay all right um you've you've mentioned that you you've been on on on the job long enough to know what this particular job requires uh on that note uh what challenges if any have you identified uh in in that division that would require uh an incoming Deputy judge president to to take action devise measures to to to address those challenges just just concisely yes concisely uh in my assessment um chief justice uh the the real issue of the division is the Fallout of failure of leadership um in fact that is the elephant in the room um that uh there's been this protracted Discord involving the leadership and everything else that went with that we most of us know uh about the the public face of that um it's quite obvious that U the difficulty in the division is the uh in the division are the divisions that resulted from that situation it persists it's there um that is part of the reason that uh persuaded me when I was approached to to make myself available have been steeped in that Division I know all of the senior judges I've worked with many of them if not most and I know all the other judges um so I'm well aware of uh of of what the the actual cause of the problems are as I've said it's a it's a failure of leadership and what you require is not an administrator a technocrat what you require is an effective leader so you so so you you require effective leadership um and uh that is effective leadership um is really not what you do it's what you are it is is um part of your nature the the the traits of effective leadership uh are inherent really uh the fundamental Hallmark is service you must most they they they use the term servant leader that's really what it's the essence of it is um you must respect in order to earn respect and to earn uh Buy in um and that is it's it's obviously what had lacked and which resulted in the situation that that obtained they have you worked in that division in uh in the Western Cape yes yes yes oh yes when uh are are you referring to judicial uh yes yes no I've uh I've I've as I've said I've spent um four plus years uh acting in that division oh you acted as a judge there yeah most of the acting time was spent in that Court okay um fled offway in 1998 already okay I'm I'm sorry I I I may have cut you short you were still addressing us on on your vision had you finished uh so so really uh chief justice what is required s singularly is um to return the division to normality and cohesion and to restore its um stature and esteem through resolving the um the issue that I've refer to the one of of Discord Strife lack of collegiality uh polarization and the like it's not it's not in my assessment uh an issue around the systems or technical issues the systems are fine they've been there for a long time and they they functional it's not the systems it's relationships that's where it lies of course the other things that one can uh that one can look at um but that fundamentally is what it's all about you'll tell me when you have finished yes yes you have um perhaps I can I can just share some other thoughts while I'm at this um draw drawing on the my the situation where I am currently based um I think what one could do quite profitably is to look at the issue of decentralization in in that division I'm in a court with which also serves a a large significant geographical area and where there are five seats of the court and you can see although that's also historical but uh you can see the difference that it makes with regard to accessibility um it's important when one looks at the the Western Cape to to to think along the lines of what is started off um slowly there is the commission have heard that there is a Court established in talu which is in southern Cape the previous judge president has taken initiatives around uh sittings in prisons designating prisons a special courts with all of the cost savings and the rest of it that go with that um so those are initiatives that could be um pursued further uh to bring the the courts closer to the people which is which is the U the ultimate um objective so so I believe that there's something that could be done uh around that issue which as I've said I've seen in in in action where I am um there are um questions around the turnover of um of judges through retirement mostly obviously senior uh judges uh the commission has heard I I I accept that um there are a number of Judges who would be retiring senior judges be retiring shortly um in the next next year or so two and the challenge around that is that uh um there is often not proactive uh steps to uh to deal with that uh process of natural attrition um so that is something that that needs to be looked at um one can consider ways of transferring skills from those uh to newer judges um the is uh sort of a informal uh situation where uh there are some of the senior judges who are um engaged in training empowering uh newer judges um I understand for example that uh two of those senior judges uh have been conducting the these these um uh sessions over lunchtime uh in their free time where there is obviously uh skills transfer uh in that process there is of course uh a need for continuing education the the present sort of limited uh processes need to be expanded uh I have myself benefited from uh Prime primary judicial training uh as a practitioner uh we have uh undergone training by the Canadians who are very good at this um and uh I've seen that there is benefit to have that sort of um facility as it were available which can simultaneously increase your pool of potential candidates and to upskill your your existing um serving judges so um so that is is is something that uh that needs to be to be looked at there is I understand uh some sensitivity around that to make sure that when uh hearings panels are constituted that you try to pay the U members on the panel so that you have skills transfer so you can put a a newer judge with a senior judge uh which of course is a very effective way of uh of learning the U judicial function is a practical one you you you gather experience and skills as you go along so so that is an important U process that uh can possibly be expanded as it were so those are the kinds of things that one one one could look at all right um I've already mentioned your age should it be an impediment to your appointment that that you'll be turning 68 soon no I don't believe uh chief justice uh I would have uh all things being equal uh forther 8 years until you work until 75 yes I can I can't do that I I am in a state to do that so how how is your health for me ask it is uh uh it is I I don't want to use the word excellent you know what health is like but it's it's good yeah we don't want to jinx things no no no no we know all right but uh but there's no issues there's no physical issues there um perhaps else I'm sorry uh age age um should not really be such a big concern see because this this uh job requires uh skill and experience you only acquire those uh through to practical exposure this is a it's it's a it's a practical field so the conventional wisdom is has always been that um you are ready for judicial appointment um towards your later years and that uh that those are the the types of um candidates that uh that are able to just move seamlessly into this the the job and to and to perform so so one should not scoff at at age um in fact that is perhaps one of our difficulties when uh when one thinks of the turnover of of Judges is that uh you you have a challenge to attract sufficiently experienced um candidates because that's what you require for various reasons um you must obviously make the the uh uh the position attractive to those kinds of of uh of candidates but it's difficult it's difficult to do that um so if uh if those kinds of candidates look at the workload of uh of Judges uh which is not always appreciated or understood um issues around adequate remuneration uh then it's it's there are there are few incentives for for for for those kinds of U candidates to be persuaded to to Avail themselves okay just gber thank you CJ I'll be brief evening Mr sorry judge for evening judge Campbell um from your CV it's clear that you you were born in what was then known as UT is k k you're quite right yeah and then you moved to the Western Cape for for education for your um university education that's right you I think you know the situation in those years yeah yeah so I to come I to come to W and C a big I I had to come up to Western Cape yes although there was a university in Port Elizabeth upe in those years and a university in kown yeah you had no choice I had no choice yes but but since then uh put since then you practiced in Cape Town the whole time that is true and record will reflect that we were members of the bar together in in the 80s and thereafter that is quite so um when was the last time that you acted in the I always call it the CPD the Western Camp high court I you probably still call it the CPD as well yes when was the last time that you acted there um uh I couldn't pick that up from your I have to look in the narrative uh if you'll just bear with me no the last I think it's 2009 2009 yes yeah and then uh thereafter in the Eastern Cape in 2019 and 2021 that's true um you you never applied for appointment in the in the Western Cape High Court did you uh judge gamble um I think perhaps you will remember pardon I think perhaps you'll remember when when I was uh appointed in the in the truth commission uh it was in well I did the initial process and then I I was on the commission as well uh which was supposed to have a lifespan initially of of it months um I made myself available for appointment in in Cape Town uh in 1997 uh at that stage I had 11 years of practice um and I would probably have stood a reasonable chance that at that stage however I was um prevailed upon uh from up high not to abandon the trlc process which which we then had to continue beyond the 18 months because it was It was obviously too too short so so I exceeded to that and I never took that appointment uh and then just uh and carried on with those duties until I completed them um so so there I was uh I I seriously applied to be appointed I was ready also to be appointed but then this uh this intervened um and then of course once I was done with that uh you know the the realities of raising children growing children going to high school going to Varsity um I think most of us know what the implications are there uh it was just not feasible to to then pursue appointment so I I had carried on back in my practice and um then of course we had the unfortunate situation there in the court um uh at that stage I wasn't really approached again to act for example um it was as we all know it was a bit un wholesome at that stage and then of course the situation uh arose in the Eastern Cape and uh I I acted after I was asked by one of my friends who is on the on the bench sorry to I I'm concerned yeah I mean for instance on this question the question was simply one did the candidate apply for appointment in the western C but for that answer now we have a very fresh start um presentation and it I'm not sure how far we are I mean if we don't control this at the end of the day we will be here until very late yeah we we we do still have two more candidates who've been waiting out there like you judge so let just try to keep the answers as concise as possible I appreciate that I thought I'll just give the context but but yes you right judge camell sorry I I'll try and get to the point um when you applied in in the Eastern Cape you came before the commission on the 6th of April 2022 and the uh the proceedings are in the pack I think you've seen them yes yes um and you used a rather quaint phrase when uh the Chief Justice then was um judge chief justice Z was welcoming you and introducing you and um he said we he said to you I understand that in the past certain people had made attempts to persuade yourself to persuade you to make yourself available but did not ex did not did not succeed it looks like somebody has succeeded this time and you replied to him by saying the following JP is a JP is very is a very persuasive man J he told me the first time when I went down there that the understanding is that cattle always graay towards their towards their home state uh and and I understood that to mean that you had decided to go back to your route in in in in the Eastern Cape well well partly but that was part of the consideration yes so so so why are you back here in the western C well well sorry why do you want to be back here in the western C yes but he is a South African he's free to go anywhere he wants to judge gamble I'm from the Eastern C but here I am working in Johannesburg I I I would I I would genuinely like to to try and contribute to to uh to things up there judge Campbell that that division has been good to me is your family still here for many years well well with stradling my wife my wife prefers to be in Cape Town I am in uh I'm in thank you Mr B I have no questions chief justice no questions Commissioners commissioner uh chief justice good evening Jud evening commissioner thanks I'm one of the junior councel that appeared before you inata I think I can vouch that you're one of the best judges but on this one uh you said to be a senior of senior judges in the western cap division that's what to said and um I did ask some some of the contestant before but I think I must also ask you the same um I take it that you are aware of the challenges being experienced by that Division and if recommended then how can you um er uh be expected to be uh accepted by those senior judges we have talked about um uh as as their ahead how are you going to be able uh to manage those Dynamics in that division that's the only question I have yes thank you now as I've commissioner as I've indicated um all of those uh senior judges uh including Jorge gamble as he has has indicated we've been colleagues at the bar way back already so I I know all of them I have a good relationship with all of them I've got no issues with any of them I'm sure and take taking the encouragement that I've gotten and uh to to make myself available that I I wouldn't have any difficulty to uh to rely on their support uh in uh in in addressing the issues of the of the division thank you CH chief justice thank you commissioner it's been a long day so we'll we'll let you go at this stage judge thank you you're excused chief justice I'm inded to you and the Commissioners thank you for for"
UfZOSh4k5XI,100 Days of GNU: We are in a good place: Sysman Motloung weighs in,2024-10-14T17:40:54Z,1328,all right of course as we continue then to monitor developments there at Luli house tonight the president of the nnc will be sharing his Reflections on the government of national Unity these are some of the live visuals there that are currently taking place and of course we will then keep tracking the story for you and bring it to you as soon as of course he starts speaking that is Reverend Vil mad who is the chaplain of the ANC you can see the Secretary General of the party as well as the ANC president there as well with a number of supporters that have gathered outside lul house center of course we stay with this particular story and speak to political analyst San ml who is joining us San good evening to you and thank you so much for your time um certainly quite an interesting time if some of the views of our viewers are anything to go by tonight um the government of national Unity having just marked 100 days um in office as well a number of varying views some are saying that they've done well um so far to tackle some of the issues others are saying they're doing just fine it's still early days but others are saying there's nothing to write home about because you still see mass murders you still see the issues of crime electricity um unemployment is still some of the problems for you how has this government of national Unity faed so far yeah I think uh it is a matter of really looking into these subjectivities because they is people who would want to see drastic changes immediately after this but my view is that it is not tenable it is UN really unrealistic for one to expect a significant shift in the political system within the 100 days but this uh gnu has been good because we start to hear narratives especially from the da more of a realist understanding of what government is going through or what government performance is all about you hear how the Democratic Alliance is talking about having to cut budgets to certain departments generally across government but da is Raising that tone of Crisis to say government just does not have enough money if you have listened to Mr stain recently he was also saying government cannot bail out State on entities anymore because that is money that should go to servicing people elsewhere you bail out this institutions s soes but they don't perform as you want them to so we get to understand that had da or a different political party had significant power maybe we could see a different shift in policies but currently it's a counterbalancing mechanism I think we are we are very good in a good place currently and you talk about a good place but how secure is that good place particularly when you listen to um yesterday morning for example was in conversation with the da Helen Zilla who still is adamant that this is not a government of national Unity according to her she's still calling it a coalition but she says you can call it by Any Other Name yeah what she is saying I don't think it is anything that would destabilize the government of national Unity this is mainly about Framing and she stands together with the MK party who have said you cannot call this a government of national Unity I think Miss is also talking on that if you are to coin it and frame it in a purist manner the government of national Unity incorporates most dominant stakeholders in society and the MK is one of the dominant parties it is not part of this Arrangement therefore if you have excluded such powerful actors you cannot claim to be to have formulated a government of national Unity so call it a grandis whatever you call it but I think what m is saying is the fact is that ANC is not in government alone ANC is not making absolute decisions it has somebody else to hold it in check and this is what democratic Alliance is enjoying I think that they have come to weaken this arrogance of thec in power and this is something the DA has to write home about so we could disagree on those is it a government of nationality purist or grand Coalition as others are saying by but da is saying I think the message is that NC is not governing on its own and this is a sign maybe that that dominance of the NC is waning away possibly in the next election that could be worse and another party would be stronger whether it will be MK or da we we are yet to see how much of a test is you know uh is it going to be for this government of national Unity um the local government elections because um we've seen what took place in um the da is certainly not happy about the removal of CIA Brink there and saying that for them this is a thorn and it's a serious issue because remember it comes against the backdrop of a democratic Alliance that is also not in government a part of government in the province of Ken one wonders then how much of a big test are these local government elections going to be for this government of national Unity yeah they definitely are going to be difficult you you you see this local government elections coming in an era of coalition government so what we see in t could be a Prelude between actions ANC e that they could work together somewhere and the exclusion of the of the da by actiona is also kind of a Revenge because actions complained that da committed that they will not work with the NC under any circumstance ances but at the national level there da is working with the NC and this was a betrayal of that agreement between this parties and I think this is what a is now saying that the da cannot claim to be pure and holy and use let's say use other parties as a a step ladder to to power and this is what a is trying to do so da will have more than Partners to rely on it has to provide a policy direction that is more compelling for the electorate to to trust it on the other side e could be losing ground EF has a lot to do and this is an opportunity maybe in in 20 for actions a to make itself known so this will be a very competitive local government elections also not forgetting that there is also that voter apathy the fatigue of a voter having to go to elections again there to be some compelling reason for the voter to go to to to participate in the elections so that messaging from I and other political parties has to be strengthened otherwise we may see a low voter turnout also considering national elections we had a low voter turn out so that is a likelihood again so we see that we have a lot of work to to do before local government elections to pump up that excitement for people to go participate and to build that trust in political part is again but do you think that the you know actiona um will be able to make inroads um through its government in given the fact that this is a party through its leader Herman mashaba said they'll never work with the ANC even going as far as forming a moonshot act with other political parties and here they are now hey you so politics are about eventuality so it's like something could happen anything can happen and we see being drawing headlines or yeah let's say drawing headlines in politics is the Fest because sometime the landscape changes so much that you have to compromise which is a true nature of politics politics are about compromise give and take so we could hope that with they can try build the name for himself some reputation for themselves but this is just one municipality you cannot rely on you being in power in or anywhere and think the whole of South Africa will trust you all these political parties should be present on the ground be with the people when they struggle with water be there to intervene when they struggle with sewage with electricity with Pooles and anything as we see children are dying because of some food issues where are political parties in the space what are they saying how are they intervening to bring Solutions these are Big questions where people expect these political parties to be suffering with with them I think actions somehow it has tried to make itself visible but they have a lot work or letot of work to do as other par political parties do as you can see there at the bottom of your screen those are live visuals from Luli house just outside there as the ANC um is marking um what was a 100 days of the government of national Unity we do know of course that has come and gone but we're still in conversation with salesman M salesman we're seeing a fig lalula there the party's Secretary General and he is a man who in recent days was seen to be at loggerheads with the um you know the the chair of thec in the province of King what did you read into those apparent tensions yeah this is something maybe confusing it on one side but it is also expected of Mr balula you don't know we could call him excitable or somebody who who really is impulsive and later on has to rethink his his actions or is it because somebody spoke to him call him to order but we see somebody in Mr B who still tries to asset a particular discipline but it is not also nice in a sense that you want to silence certain narratives from different camps in the ANC also remember they coming to an elective Conference of the party so you want to see potential people eming it is a question in public after Mr R who will be the success is it the current Deputy president or somebody else and I think what Mr Lui is doing could be also another tonality that shows that there's an alternative voice in the ANC instead of this silence and honic support of what Mr Raposa stands for and could it be also personality cles between Bala and Lui so this is what I'm reading here we could see maybe Bala and Lui Ling heads maybe in in different slates or so but this is a buildup it's a start now of what we could expect heading up to the elective Conference of the ANC and of course we are waiting for ANC president s Raposa um to you know speak and address that particular crowd giving his um reflections of the government of national Unity he has said um in previous days that he is actually quite happy with how things are going and saying that the debate has been quite um you know you know serious within the government of national Unity
G7gpIiUBFQk,Tito Mboweni believed in the healing of the nation - Father Michael Lapsley,2024-10-14T17:34:46Z,1276,now tributes continue to pour in for the late former Finance Minister and Reserve Bank Governor diton boeni boeni has been widely praised for shaping the post apartate Economic Policy he passed away at the weekend aged 65 following an illness Bo he served as the first black governor of the Central Bank between 1999 and 2009 and let her served as Finance Minister between 2018 as well as 2021 now for more on this we speak to Father Michael Lapsley who is the president of the healing of memories Global Network good afternoon to you father and thank you so much for your time before we even get into a whole lot of detail surrounding your friendship and earlier years let's just start with your reaction to the passing of the former Reserve Bank uh thank you Von and and good afternoon to all the viewers um I must say I was deeply deeply shocked I'm in Europe at the moment and I for some reason I woke up just after midnight and looked at my phone and messages had started flooding in to say that uh Cho had passed away so a sense of of great shock and also great sadness as well that a friend of more than 40 years had very very suddenly in a way been taken from us and when did you meet him for the first time we met him 1980 I I at that stage was both a chaplain uh and a student at the uh National University of luchu and I was already part of the African National Congress of South Africa and Tito had uh with a group of other people um like uh Gua raki um had had left the University of the North and come to uh Exile uh in the Sut so I guess it was in the first week or so that he arrived in the suu we met and we became immedately comrades and and and in many ways lifelong friends uh ever since and I was reading your letter um earlier on quite heartwarming but there's one striking moment um that you mentioned there in that letter you say and I quote the night I opened a letter bomb on April 28th 19 1990 in harar in Zimbabwe I had just picked up the phone to arrange to meet you later that evening Pick up the story for us well yes um and then and then I picked up the phone to speak to Chito and and and the bomb went off um and and of course the cor never went through uh but if in fact Cho had come to my house earlier he may well have been uh grievously injured uh in in in the bomb um as well at that at that moment but that fortunately was not meant to be I I got the letter bomb lost my hands and ey Etc and Tito uh indeed survived and went on to play extraordinary role uh in in a new Democratic order and how did he react to your injuries well I think like everybody were very very shocked um I'd been on a South African government hit list for several years at that point but it was after the release of Nelson Mandela and and we believe that um the the fighting was coming to an end um and indeed we were going to go home we're going to negotiate and build a different kind of country because we know now in retrospect that what happened to me was a straw and the wind um in the sense that for the close setting period was a very violent and bloody period where the regime took its policy of destabilization from from the Frontline States back to uh South Africa so I think it was the timing as well which as well as the actual event that shocked you know friends and comrades and in fact people across southern Africa I keep meeting people from different parts of the world who who s heard about it on TV and radio and talk about what the impact that it had on them as well and perhaps especially because uh you know I'm a priest Pastor um and the bomb had been put inside two religious magazines so I was a very cynical schol in cold blooded act um but again I me Tito and other comrades they they were beside me um for the months of talk and um that kind of support enabled me to um travel my own Journey from being a freedom fighter uh to becoming a Healer and starting the institute for healing of memories and Tito continued throughout the years both as a minister excuse me um and and and also as Resort Bank Governor to support the work of healing of memory so he believed in the healing of the nation as much as he was involved in the rec in the construction of a new nation and of course he called you Holy Father what was the story behind that well I don't know when it said um T Tito uh whenever he spoke to me he would I I would get a phone call and Tito would say Holy Father how are you um and and as I said I don't think he that I was the pope but somehow it was a kind of a term of affection and endearment um and but it spoke to it way um a closeness of relation we were comrades we were friends but also recognized that I was a priest and and played a pastoral role uh to him and other comrades as well U but it was quite a Bea and of it was also the tone with which he said it that had its own sweetness and charm to it and and of course he's a man um that has been described by many um that we've been in conversation with since his passing um that in fact he was direct and we saw this of course not mincing his words when it comes to what he thought about whatever the situation was in the country at the time whether be it as the first labor Minister um in a democratic South Africa also at the same time um you know whether it's Reserve Bank Governor whether it's Finance Minister certainly not mining his words even afterwards how would you describe him away from his public life well I think overall uh I mean I've been reading all the tributes that have been made to him and and and and and not one person not one across our political Spectrum have questioned his Integrity um that he was a man of principle a man of integrity um and and as you say he didn't miss his words he always said what he believed and I think um that he didn't just line up he was part of the ANC he was part of the government but he had his own integrity and his own ability uh to speak his mind and I think that oh BS well for the future of our country to have an example like that of someone who knows who they are has their own principles and is able to make that contribution and contribution to the ongoing and the intellectual debate I mean a lot of the people that talk about his contribution focuses on The Reserve Bank period correctly the first black governor and Minister of Finance but in some ways his time as minister of Labor and Nelson Mandela's government was where uh things like nlac um legislation to protect workers is also part of the legacy of of Cho bweni that that we as a nation have every reason uh to be thankful for and briefly uh father speaking about his legacy uh of course in the latter years we saw a lot of um cooking um when it comes to his social media profile and of course a lot of people having quite a lot to say about his cooking abilities was he always somebody who liked to cook well I think it's just something he loved to do but I think in a sense it shows that he wasn't a if you like a unidimensional person he was a multi-dimensional person so yes he was a great financer Economist Patriot but also somebody like to I think that speaks to the fullness of us humanity and I as I sort of said in you know I wrote this letter after he passed away I'm wondering whether um is he happy with a cuisine in the next life or I've asked them to do cooking lessons for others father thank you so much for your time and condolences as well to you um and of course his family as well but thank you so much for talking to us that was Father Michael Lapsley president of the healing of memories Global Network
8oTgYpttZdc,"100 Days OF GNU I Stability of the ANC, NHI & Political disputes",2024-10-14T17:03:25Z,2138,and we stay of course with this particular story NC president s Raposa will provide a comprehensive reflection on the key achievements of the government of national Unity this afternoon the gnu comprising of 10 political parties is marking 100 days since the constituting of the 7th Administration in June the celebration will take place at the anc's headquarters in Luli house in Johannesburg this afternoon let's now cross live Toc news reporter Sam M of course Sam it's not 100 days now I'm sure it's way more than that now but of course there's been quite a lot of focus on the government of national unity and what it's been able to achieve so far we are asking our viewers tonight what do they make of its performance so far and three of them tonight responding to say that for them issues like crime are still a concern issues like job creation are still a concern in you know for them when they looking at the government of national Unity what are some of the reflections that the ANC has been able to share with you as the media indeed bong at this point in time the president of the ANC is yet to speak they are still in the officials meeting they are still deliberating but we did speak to other officials of the ANC such as the deputy president Paul mashad and also the deputy Secretary General of the ANC Mrs Nana who reflected on the first 100 days of the government of national Unity saying and praising the ANC and how it has brought about stability in an era where there was no outright winner in the elections in on the 29th of May ultimately saying that they did invite all political formations to discussions and 10 out of those political formations agreed to form a government of national Unity within the an with thec saying that there will be disagreement within the gnu and they will find mechanisms in order to resolve those particular disputes we've spoken to some of the ANC leaders who've said that the public spats that are there particularly around the Bell bill those must stop there is a a resolution mechanism that is being formed that will be chaired by Deputy president Paul mashati and we'll have representatives from all of the 10 political formations I know the Democratic Alliance is sending de mcferson is not yet clear who the ANC will send to that particular committee to look at some of the bottlenecks and some of the issues and policy issues that they can't find themselves on particularly on clause three and four of the Bell bill you look at the national health insurance as well that will be discussed within that particular committee that similar committee will also be set up politically which will look at the political disputes that are there within government and how these political formations in the gnu can discuss them and there is a clause in the statement of intent that there must be sufficient consensus within the within the parties of the government of national Unity for a particular policy that has Divergent views to go ahead so one may presume that the issue of The Bella Bill particularly close three and four will go to this dispute resolution committee that will particularly look at this particular issue and these Clauses in order to find sufficient consensus so that it can be fully implemented in government as you know that the president has suspended its implementation for about 2 to three months to allow sufficient consensus there's also no consensus on the issue of the national health insurance which was signed in the previous administration the DA has some serious reservations and how it will ultimately collapse the economy of the country bong course this is happening um without a critical uh member of the alliance and that is the sap because they U you know through um solima of course they've been unhappy he's actually spoken quite um you know hard-hitting words against this particular government of national Unity but it's also interesting Sam that in a conversation I had yesterday with the DA's Federal chair Halen zela she repeats what she says she believes this is not a government of national unity and she says that according to her this is still a coalition because it does not include everybody else well well there is divers views not only within thec but also within the Democratic Alliance not only in the tri Alliance the da seems to be pulling in two different directions we've got John Stan haen the leader of the party pulling in another Direction and you've got Helen Zilla the federal chairperson pulling in a different direction which will practically set up those those contestations within the party what we also do know is that the sacp they snapped a meeting with the ANC officials this uh morning where the sacp's leadership was supposed to come and discuss with the leadership of the African National Congress here at Luli house and discuss some various political matters that will look at resolving the impass that is there particularly within the trite Alliance at this point in time what we do know is the sap in their Central committee meeting they said that they will not form part of this particular Reflections they don't agree with the government of national Unity it has been rumored for some time with the ANC saying that these may only be the views of solima P the General Secretary of the sap but it seems as if the Central Committee of the sap has come out to back its General Secretary Sol in saying these are the views of the Communist party but one wonders why are the likes of Bladen zande the likes of Dr David maso who are leaders of the sap who sit in the top leadership of the sap who are still enjoying their levish positions in government why are they not resigning in order that the sap does not agree with the government of national unity and it does look like Sam I'm not sure what is taking place there but give us a sense of where we are in terms terms of the program because I do see quite a bit of activity um just behind you does look like there are some people who are either leaving or are still awaiting an official program to get underway at this point in time B there are ANC members who are gathered outside here some have been brought to this side behind us they are getting some sort of Refreshments water and some some juice in order for them to have something to ni on as they wait for the arrival of the anc's top Rass leadership the ANC officials meeting is still going ahead inside the DSG did come out to speak to us and we also spoke to the deputy president I did see Manana andc National working Committee Member and I also did see the NOA the the general the Secretary General rather of thec women's league they did come out and they did go there to that particular stage where the ANC officials and some of the ANC NC members will be seated there there are some leaders of the ANC who are already on that particular Podium who are not sitting in the officials meeting in fact I am seeing Manana there on the podium with a cap a white cap he is the anc's national organizer so he is part and parcel of those who are organizing for this particular 100 day review of the government of national unity bongu and of course Sam just um you know while you speak about some of the officials there anyone from the Hang leadership the howang provincial leadership will come here we are told that pazi the provinal chair TK are the provinal secretary they are part and parcel of the mobilization for this particular event they will come and we do know that the president of the ANC Raposa did reprimand the Secretary General of the ANC fig Mula to today on these particular public SPS between himself and also the provincial chairperson of Hing and Premier baz Henri lufi all right samel we'll catch up with you a little later on as soon as the uh of course the events get underway there and we are expecting president s Raposa in his capacity as ANC president to then address the crowd speaking about the reflections of the government of national Unity post it's 100 days if you would remember there's been a number of conversations that we've had here on the channel including um the minister of international relations as well ronad lamula we also been speaking to quite a number of those who are in office to ensure that we get to encapsulate their sense of what do they think about this government of national unity and of course with the sap still not mincing its words through solim P saying that it does still not believe that this is the perfect vehicle um for the people of South Africa but of course thec is saying that it's forging ahead when it comes to these celebration so we will have some analysis a little later on for you

Dcyav9kRESs,Orange Farm Shooting | There's a sign of social disorganisation - Prof Jacob Mofokeng,2024-10-14T16:24:26Z,3178,welcome back let's continue to this now the community of donga informal settlement in orange farm uh calling for strict regulations on taverns in the area now this after eight people including the suspect were shot dead in the early hours of Sunday morning the incident is alleged to have been sparked by a fight that ensued between a Tavern owner and a male Patron now the tavern owner allegedly followed the male Patron who was a visitor at a nearby house and on arrival fired shots randomly killing seven people including a three-year-old child to speak more on this let's not welcome Professor Jacob mukang a crime and violence expert Prof thank you so much for your time this afternoon I mean we have seen several mass shootings in the country over the last few weeks especially with the most shocking of course being the one in luiki where 18 people were gunned down as we get your reaction to this latest incident perhaps give us the factors um you know behind the driving that are driving the increase in mass shootings in both I would imagine urban and rural areas uh good afternoon anati and good afternoon to sabc news uh viewers uh indeed uh we have seen this sech of mass killings you know across South Africa and mostly in certain provinces um it seems as if we have taken over you know the animal kingdom where we have adopted the so-called a killing Instinct we see a lot of you know people being killed as if the country is thirsty for you know for for for blood so we we we have observed that you know since you know our Democratic dispensation we have been you know observing how in the previous dispensation how the previous government you know was using oppressive means in any means to oppress you know certain people including African people in the country but then it means that the way in which we retaliated then it was a means of violence of which it was you know Justified but you know uh post you know democracy you know the the availability of illegal Firearms as well as you know the escalation of gender based violence you know how we kill people you know during road rage on the road it just shows that we are just an angry Nation you know and and you know the incident that you have just indicated now you know is someone who is in position of a firearm that it's not yet you know known whether it's it's a licensed firearm but the manner in which you know uh he exercised the aggression so to kill even people that were not part of that you know and a fight it just shows that you know most of the people are are very angry and it is you know a sign of social disorganization normally you know in any you know if you see animals you know in a particular tribe or group you know whenever they are not you know there are no Intruders they work together but in a event of this organization the same group of animals that are working together they start fighting amongst each other so we see also an element of disorganization in South Africa where we have adopted this culture of you know any means you know by means of you know killing even innocent people you know as a means of retaliation as a means of expressing our rage you know and and our anger so it is very much unfortunate that also the use of firearms you know will always Venture as indicated in the cases of lukity and Prof before before you get to the the Firearms I think we're going to touch a little bit on this I mean just on the some of the words that you're saying I mean it does raise the question is this country a violent country I mean having said that then uh the question then also follows what are the main challenges that law enforcement authorities face in preventing these mass shootings I know of course that the law enforcement authorities in this country are not the only ones that should be addressing this matter it is a complex one it is a societal issue too but in the main are we a violent country country yes we are a violent country and we have to you know accept that and and begin working with how then can we you know reduce the level of anger you know and and aggression in inside Africa indeed you know as I indicated that you know it in the past you know how we used to ban buildings and do other things it was just something that is Justified look at how people are celebrating the killing of the suspects in the guazu natal you know is a means to say we are tired of being harassed and terrorized you know it it means that we have now you know validated violence and we you know violence has become part of us as a new culture whereby you know whenever we have to solve issues you know it has to to come through violence and unfortunately you know uh uh we are now expecting the South African Police Service to be everywhere you know but also you know the incident of what is happening you know behind the scenes where South African Police Service will not be there like in the case of this particular incident so you don't expect the police to be there but we are talking about do we have to allow people to have to carry firearms in such you know intensive you know Society where you know uh you know uh you you step on someone's Toes that particular person will not say you are hating me the person will say I'll kill you so so it just shows that we are so angry nation and eventually we are indeed you know a violent country I mean just uh in slight difference in terms of uh these crimes that we are seeing the one major difference in this particular incident is that the allerg perpetrator has also of course committed suicide bringing the number of dead people to eight uh without of course knowing the exact details with this case I mean does this this fact have any significant meaning do you think you know perhaps to the the mental state perhaps of the tavern owner or just the issue around violence around tans in this country well you know the person you know had a position of a firearm probably because of you know the issues of extortions and this people they need to protect themselves but you see EO as well as an a weapon you know in a case where the person has been provoked you know so we see that there's a lack of emotional intelligence for someone in a position of a firearm so this person is supposed to know that he's working with you know customers that and some of them will be irritating especially it I'm sure it was not the first time that someone will come when a tent has been closed and it means that it is a common occurrence and the person was supposed to have been prepared that well this is what happens normally when people are drunk but for that particular individual to follow this particular Patron to a place where people were celebrating where even a child lost a life it just shows you know the the ego of this particular person and as well as in possession of a firearm so it just talk that you know we allow Firearms to be in the in the hands of people that actually are not supposed to have firearms as I indicated you know the level of aggression anger rage on the roads you know where people will eventually because either the person wants to show by standards that how then the person will respond to a particular provocation it will end up someone losing a life in know it it just shows that we have firearms but we don't know how to control you know our emotions so it is not a case where someone was you know protecting you know his livelihood as well as his life where there was Intruder in the T so we we you know we see this you know in South Africa that if then we have come to a point where people are killed you know you know twice the amount as compared with the previous years where people are losing their lives indeed then we have to look into this particular matter that we have a problem of Rage we have a problem of aggression you know it could be you know the the the life itself we aware that you know life is BEC more expensive the power failures you know we thought that we we passed the era of load shedding but it looks like we are an angry bunch of people it does and it doesn't help of course that we do have you know those regulations stiff ones I might add where it is very difficult to acquire a firearm legally in this country but seemingly very easy to acquire one illegally as you've also indicated to Prof but thank you so much for your time and your analysis I really do appreciate it Professor um of course Professor Jacob M there for us
cdD9gC9PrzU,Orange Farm Shooting | Families struggling to forgive perpetrator: Calvin Dludla updates,2024-10-14T16:15:28Z,11234,and moving on to this the families of these seven people who were shot and killed at orange farm south of Johannesburg say they struggling to forgive the perpetrator five members of One family a neighbor and a friend who were shot dead in the early hours of Sunday morning police say the incident happened in the Mong informal settlement following an argument between a tavin owner and a male Patron it's alleged that the tavn owner followed the patron to his home and shot seven people including a three-year-old child the suspects later died in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound SBC news reporter Calvin cler has been tracking the story for us and joins us in studio now Calvin of course this is a very difficult story for the community as one can imagine before we even get into um how the community is still trying to process all of what happened here let's start with the very latest from the family of the perpetrator how are they taking this you know b as you have mentioned earlier good afternoon to you and to your viewers at home this is one of the difficult stories to crack and today we went back there at and we tried to track the family members of the alleged perpetrator um in this case unfortunately when we arrived H in his house the house the gate was locked and there was no one there we were told that H the shop that we found there belongs to the perpetrator but unfortunately for even that shop was closed when we asked around the community members and the neighbors who are closed to him they are saying that after the shooting the alleged suicide um the wife of the perpetrator packed her back and go because and he went she went because the community members wanted to come and B that house so they wanted a revenge and she had to leave and it speaks of the tensions within that particular Community let's talk about how are they dealing with this crisis that has now unfolded B before we went to the perpetrator house we started at the very same house where this incident took place we found one mother um that mother the child that was shot and killed the disabled child that was shot and killed H belongs to that mother and that mother told sa sen that she is struggling to cope bong where she is saying she's devastated she was crying hysterically saying that she doesn't know what happened she is even blaming herself that because she was not there when all that happened if she was there she would have tried H to help and assist her child she is saying she was the child that she loved remember she's disabled she said that even though it was so difficult extreme difficult to raise a disabled child but she will dearly dearly miss her she even made an example saying that if the the perpetrator had a choice she would rather say let me just lay in on top of my child if you want to shoot then you can shoot me and then so that my child can survive how are the other family members um you know processing everything that has happened B it's difficult understandably so there's an interview that we had earlier with Channel 404 the agenda with ayatti where I I spoke to them all of them they are crying they traumatic B they traumatic they're crying they can't finish a sentence without crying and they are saying that they are traumatic they can't sleep um the Survivor is because she told this ABC News team that when she tries to close her eyes all this comes up she she she she thinks that that it was a dream a nightmare but unfortunately for them it happened fortunately the Department of Social Development anding H went there H to talk to them we saw social workers they were engaging them because we when we had that interview I I did say that I I personally think that they need counseling but they are not taking it easy it's all it's understandable so it it has not happened in that area they told us even though the crime is rif in that area but they are telling us that it's a f of a Kind it has never happened and for them it will take time to heal it and and and and you know Calvin this was supposed to be a joyous day for them they were celebrating um as a family and I suppose it now means that they are in morning instead of the celebrations that they would have started earlier on in the day have they made any funeral arrangements at all you know B when you cover such stories you you tiptoe you check on what questions do I have to ask because one would say it's a sensitive question but we asked about the funeral Arrangement they said because this is something that is so big shocking and they were not expecting it they are waiting for other family members to come and they will keep on updating us h on funeral arrangement I know it's difficult to ask a person who is crying who's shocked and devastated as to when are you bearing your loved one it's it's an unfair question but as a journalist you have to ask so they told us that they will update us as time goes by but I must say watching your interviews um and even with the Survivor yesterday you've been handling this with the sensitivity that the story requires so thank you so much for talking to us Calvin and let's hear then from you know them throughout the course of the days as to how then are they going to uh be bearing their loved ones and where but appreciate your time thank you so much that is my colleague there Calvin L UMBC news reporter
7Qfu4dezqRM,100 Days of GNU | Nomvula Mokonyane briefs the media,2024-10-14T16:09:54Z,2404,"ANC president s Raposa is expected to give a comprehensive reflection on the key achievements of the government of national Unity this afternoon that's going to be happening a little bit later on but we do understand of course that the anc's first deputy secretary General Nani is currently briefing the media let's see if we can listen in about what thec is doing today and he will she will elaborate further about DG thank you very much com mangi our spokesperson member Nation committee good evening members of the media and viewers at home we here to actually affirm what we had committed in our elections including in our Manifesto that uh we have learned the lessons and one of those lessons is that we have to remain in contact with the people of South Africa here today weting our information about accountability where we will use this platform to amongst others thank the voters thank most importantly also account to the nation how we have fed under these H H new developments new challenges and being able to keep the country together being able to execute the in our Manifesto it is about a reflection it is going to be rolled out from here then we go throughout the corners of of the country to go back again and account it's about accountability and the progress made so far G um I think it's as sassin as that I now open for any questions I will start to my right um with L and then we proceed to news room and Sac very much my name is from the M Guardian this saying that they not H the invite they not believe G and secondly also s leader as well what do you make about the issues that the said about and what yesterday thank you very much it's from new Africa in your Reflections will you also be looking Beyond just the partyt party relations within the gnu but for instance uh you know issues like the part is attacking some of your leaders as has been said when you're talking about Deputy president some feel that he's being attacked the same can be said about what are you reflecting in terms of that and then also just to talk about the health of your bran how are you very with that in particular in the provinces of Ken and and then last one from my side um just give us a sense if you could um miss m about the issue of and what happened with um you know him actually going to we actually I think given the number of questions from I'll hand over to the GSG before we lose our thank you very much this reflection is about what we're mandated to go and do post the of May we're mandated to proove the way we work we're mandated to go and delivery we're mandated to go and work that South Africans have voted and U it is what you all know as the government of national unit we also voted uh to ensure that uh we leave no one behind and hence to today's platform for us as the African National Congress is a days and as well as being able to leave to what is contained in our Manifesto about accountability as for what each party says and what each party does remember we're in the gnu not because we have collapsed any party including the African National Congress otherwise we would have had a report by a collective that constitutes a government of national it we remain an independent organization we are reflect what we have been able most importantly also we know every political party has intentions will not allow a situation where individual leaders of the NC either at the provincial level are pitted against by part of the gnu they authority to to to make any reflection or impression that they can determine who has to lead and need to constitute we have seen what the da does with us in the West Cape they've removed municipalities nine municipalities they've gone out to form new coalitions even you members of the of the media you've not gone back to them and asked them why are you doing this outside ofc conditions that does not mean anyone is excluded situation with Ken and as well as with metros here in the in the in the in the in the province of hen the the third thing is about the state of our branches and stuff I think you know that the last time we were in a meeting with um Ken post guazu natal we resolved that we'll visit all our provinces um dive deeper in reflecting on the state of the organization a 112 year old organ organization an organization that exists in over 3,000 WS an organization that has got thousands and thousands of members can't actually resolve the reflection on the state of the organization within a short period uh uh such as end of May till now we want to reflect seriously into that and have an appreciation as to what needs to be done we do not want to preempt any feedback that comes also from the different provinces that be interacting with the issue of comrade or Bella I don't understand you say you saw the letter and I did respond to you that that but now that you found the letter I have have said it it was a misrepresent it was not a mandated position it was never view on how Morocco relates and how Morocco tries to actually circumvent process that must be inclusive so that we find peace at this moment nobody was mandated by the African National Congress and hence the NC has taken a stance in that regard I think I've tried thank you much thank you DSG I'm going to take start with sabc I'm going take my colleague over here news4 of course and um times life and then I will just take our from are you as the officials of the not worried about the utterances of your Secretary General particularly when it pertains to battle that is seemingly there between himself and the Prov leadership in particular Mr are you not worried you have a discussion around this particular issue particularly after some of those uh attacks that he had laced to PFI yesterday in interview you with another with another in the country on the issue of your organization and the Metro is there is the center holding particularly on the Metros are you formula or is it mean everyone does whatever they like particularly looking at how this constit there's no appro governance mechanism to review I'm going to want to take yes thank you um the issues that you have raised uh the has had an opportunity of meeting with the person of the NC as well as having an appreciation of what was said and what was actually interpreted as his utterances where we are today we can say safely say the organization about what has happened and what is evolving you can see person of the NC will be leading a delegation branches and structures of the NC to of the reflection and I think for now would want to leave all matters um to them last week that there are no issues between LLY house the national executive committee and Committee of uh thec in unfortunately have not an opportunity of picking up some insinuations that you are ref you are referring to but for now there are no organizational issues if there are issues of personalities of course those are issues that we will have to manage so that then they don't flow into the of the organization yes G I'm from news4 um just two issues how would you describe our relationship with Mor following what that happen and then South Africa will be finding another Nation at the end of the month IJ can you just comment on our continued fight for the people of palestin oh well the issue of um of our relationship with Morocco we stand with the people of Western Sahara we support the efforts that have been made continent and also our own strategic allies such as Algeria in giving permanent solidarity and support to the people of West at at no point won't be a need for alling parties to actually come together where we are now we expect everybody to honor resolutions of the United Nations as well as the position of the a to Western Sahara so the our position has not changed and nobody has been mated change that position our resolutions have not changed um have or intention or appetite Morocco when Morocco has undermined what has been a unation the the next issue that you ask me not filing another motion were presenting they call the memorials were presenting evidence evidence to back up our case in the court and that evidence is informed by real life in Palestine real life in Gaza and of now late what has happened in Iran what has happened in Lebanon and um remember it's it's initiated through the organization that belongs here and government has been able to make South Africans to have an appreciation

ckHQc8Ch9yQ,100 Days of GNU | Political formations & Public spats: Samkele Maseko weighs in,2024-10-14T16:08:10Z,3587,let's take you to this now ANC president s Raposa will provide a comprehensive reflection on the key achievements of the government of national Unity later today the gnu comprising of 10 political parties is marking 100 days since the constituting of the sth administration in June now the celebration will take place at thec headquarters in Luli house in Johannesburg let's now cross live to our senior reporter samele maso he's been there for us for the better part of this afternoon s a very good afternoon to you again of course uh we caught that briefing by the anc's first deputy secretary General nula M but just perhaps let's reflect on some of the things that she has spoken to she has of course spoken a lot about some of the contentious issues that are playing out before the ANC president makes his address later today indeed unti she did a point out of some of the contentious issues playing themselves out within the governing party within the triarte alliance and within the government of national Unity just for instance the sap was supposed to have a bilateral meeting with the ANC this morning at 10:00 here at Luli house but the sacp ended up not pitching at all they are also not going to form part 100 government of national Unity through their General Secretary SOA yesterday they expressed their dissatisfaction with the government of national Unity but that would be the SA ACP speaking with the F tongue usually because they've got their own members within the leadership of the sap in the form of Bladen zande who forms part of the government of national Unity the deputy Minister of Finance David masondo who's also the deputy General Secretary of the sap is of the government of national Unity so the sap is pretty much speaking with the FK tongue on the one side they're saying they participating in the ANC in their rightful rights as members of the ANC but on the other side leaders of the sap they are unhappy with the ANC forming part of this government of national Unity which encompasses the Democratic Alliance these are some of the political issues that the president of the ANC will have to tackle in his speech of this 100 day review of the government of national unity and I mean uh one of the things that of course you asked a question around just some of the cracks or in in in fact what's playing out between the national ANC and local provincial ANC in hting just take us through in terms of what are the points of contention here between uh of course some provinces not forming those local governments of unity what we do know is that to the NC some have complained that the center is not holding within the party and they need to discuss this particular matter that there needs to be uniformity in how these particular governments of local Unity are formed how the governments of provincial Unity are formed which will ultimately Cascade to the national government of of national Unity but you've seen John Stan Hazen the leader of the democratic Alliance saying that the deal was only government of national Unity there was no deal that Cascades down to the provincial level and Cascades down to a local level but we do know that in the negotiations the da did say that there would be no there would be no deal at a national level if there's no deal in Ken and no deal in quaz Natal hence you saw the da in the first sitting of the provinal legislature in hen they did vote for paza lufi they did also vote for the speaker of the provincial legislature they did also vote for the deputy speaker of the legislature who was a member of the democratic Alliance later when they deadlocked on the composition of the executive that is when the da decided to pull out and to be an an opposition within the province of hen but in the province of qu natal there is a government of local Unity hence you've seen the likes of beo the provincial Secretary of the NC in quaz Nal launching the scathing attack on solaa the General Secretary of the sap doubting his Bona feeders as a communist within the Communist Party s I'm going to let you go in a few moments but perhaps as we close our conversation just your uh you know observations in as far as what we likely to hear from ANC president s Raposa today I would imagine he'll take an opportunity during this address to touch on a few issues including cluding of course the alliance partners and what's happening in as far as the criticism is concerned and perhaps the da andc question the president of the NC will reflect on what they dubbed a tactical retreat in this government of national Unity working with the Democratic Alliance and the gnu and other political formations he will speak about why they did not go for the perly black political parties which is your MK party which is your also your economic freedom fight and he will outline that they did reach out to those particular political parties some of them did come to the table but they had conditions that if they come on board some political organiz some particular organizations like the freedom front plus like the da must not form part of this government of national Unity they've also seen comments from the Secretary General of the ANC P that would be fig balula saying that pazi is advocating for ANC e fmk Coalition which is not what the ANC wants at this particular point in time deviating from what he said last week and saying thaten did act in line with the resolutions of the national executive committee he will speak about the public SPS of ANC leaders in fact today I do know that the president of the ANC s Raposa did reprimand the ANC Secretary General ANC Secretary General fig balula on his comments on the provincial chairperson of the ANC inui thank you so much for that of of course giving us a preview and a sense of what we can expect a little bit later this afternoon
OWHq2TaOIGg,Gauteng Matric Exams | Cheating issues & Security concerns,2024-10-14T15:58:15Z,749,"hen education MEC mat Chan has expressed confidence ahead of the final metric exam saying the process will run smoothly Chan says they optimistic that the class of 2024 will also perform well he's urged parents and communities to give space and support to pupils during the exams um during this period sobc news reporter balent T joins me now in studio balen thank you so much for your time so of course it is shy of a week before the matriculant write their exams just talk to us about a little bit about the highlights in fact from that briefing by the Mec well we know that it's 7 days until the official start of uh the 2024 metric examination period which will conclude uh towards the end of November now we do understand that you know the Mec seems rather optimistic that they will exceed uh last year's pass rate of 85.4% and they believe that this is based on statistics and this is based on the preliminary exams you will know that uh matriculant generally rid their prelims uh halfway during the year and before uh writing their final exams and that's what we're going to see and he's saying based on that information and the data that they have um observed as the department it would seem as though they have reason to be confident that they will exceed that 85.4% and might maintain their third position National nationally or could even exceed it it's unclear but a very optimistic um MEC of Education believing that his Department had done enough to prepare uh the learners for these upcoming exams and that they were confident that they will not let them down but a lot of issues we do understand that this time of the year comes with many many many challenges one of those is the leaking of papers and it seems as though there is some form of you know um there are some form of contingency measures uh that are in place to ensure that um there are no leaks and they're also warning students not to fall victim to unscrupulous um members of the public who then uh promised to sell them what looks like could be the potential exam paper when it is in fact uh one of the old papers uh charging as much as 1,000 Rand a piece um an exam paper and this is obviously to be problematic if you're going to as a learner learner studies and thinks that they are prepared uh when they walk into the exam room they realize that actually I am not thoroughly or well prepared for this exam and the repercussions of that and their future is also very high I want to go back to that point that you raised in terms of contingency plans in as far as a cheating is concerned we know of course that um you know in the past they'll always be concerns with cheating they'll also be concerned with leaked papers um you know protests and load shedding now with 200 days of no load shedding that probably is going to be a problem of the past we hope but in as far as those contingency plans are you know are concerned he did mention of course bringing in reinforcements so in other words more staff to facilitate in these facilities as well as cameras I heard him saying um he also spoke and touched on a little bit about um you know devices not being allowed just perhaps uh clarify all of that for us okay so I'm just going to clarify first on the issue with uh cheating so they have advised Learners not to you know um to engage in um un dishonest Behavior or dishonest conduct as the ramifications uh could be quite uh serious or are quite serious given that you are barred from writing the metric exam for a period of 3 years so that means that your life will come to a grinding halt for a period of 3 years while you try to rewrite that uh exam however they've also been warned not to bring in devices such as cell phones things that could really have information or potentially could be used uh to cheat by Learners saying that they will also have scanners at uh particular institutions to ensure that this uh does not happen on the issue of protest action and on the issue of you know disruptions the Mec has warned members of the public from a disrupting schooling in the name of Service delivery protests saying that they have uh come prepared he's named a few areas uh when he's talking about the areas where they've needed to uh beef up security measures these areas include Tak in the Far East strand um rather in a as well as um Al Dorado Park in in the westrand and another story in the rather another School in the west of Twan saying that those are some of those areas that seem to be prone to regular yes uh to regular disruptions and protest action uh due to um Service delivery issues and he's also said that you know uh those people will be met with the full might of the law uh they are going to be deploying uh crime prevention wardens and we know them they're also popularly known as the green beans whichever word you want to refer to them but they will also be deployed there law enforcement officials will also be deployed uh to certain schools to ensure that the exams do run smoothly so it seems as though there are plans to ensure that this happens uh or this examination process runs smoothly but there is another issue that was brought up by uh Umar luy last week and this was the issue of uh the basic education uh Department not having enough markers and we hear the Mec saying that they have high appointed rather seven let me get the numbers right um 10,712 um markers who are going to be marking and the first period is going to start in the early session is going to start in um November from the 12th of November uh and then end before the end of November and then the second uh session of marking will also start around the 16th of uh December and results are expected to be announced early next year not the first but just early next year um to ensure that you know people are able or Learners are able to then apply to prospective universities and I know that there's a healthy competition between provinces during that time with the Free State qualu natal anding of course much anticipation around at that time but just quickly before we wrap up um do you perhaps have numbers for us because nationally we know that looking at around 900,000 or more uh students that will be writing uh in about 7,000 um centers that have been um you know earmarked inen specifically uh what are we looking at in terms of those numbers well in terms of those numbers the numbers have been broken down and we it's been broken down into you know full-time Learners how many full-time Learners are going to be the part-time Learners those who are rewriting and and those who are yes so that that's what makes up the number of um of Learners that are going to be um writing this year's matric result um examination but we do understand that they are going to be writing at around one over 1,000 um examination um facilities or across the The Province and we also understand that they've had to bring in additional invigilators in order to ensure that you know uh to ensure the Integrity of the examinations and to ensure that um people do not then engage in any cheating dishonest behavior and so on so uh those are the numbers that we have so far thank you so much for that of course balent Teta is going to be monitoring those matriculant writing the metric class of 2024 of course um those exams starting in around 7 Days time and I what the Hing education MEC also said that um this is a time where parents should really support their children as they embark on those examinations so no more hard work but rather homework um is what he probably alluded to e e e e e e e e but thank you so much for that all right let's uh now look at news from further field and take you to what's happening in the Middle East and early morning Israeli strike has killed three people and wounded around 40 others now the attack hit the tents of displaced Palestinians inside Al akka Hospital in the central Gaza Strip city of De Al bah where a million people was Sheltering at the same time the Israeli military says a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel yesterday and killed Four soldiers and severely wounded seven others let's get more on this now um and get the situation on the ground with international relations expert Gideon chianga thank you so much Mr chianga for your time so of course uh you know having monitored what has been happening in over a year essentially in the Middle East uh let's talk about the latest I mean what can you tell us about the latest development um in the attack on Israeli Soldiers by Hezbollah this time and how uh you know this expected to impact the broader conflict in the region so I think the the pattern that is uh taking place uh lately has been a characteristic es escalation of the the I think Israel is um sort of escalated its attacks also seen the escalation uh of um Lebanon basically the air strikes followed by what the Israelis have called limited uh Visions a calculation to clear the the the hisbah fighters from their borders I think um the attacks inside Israel are quite significant in the sense that although the casualities of the conflict has been extremely high for the on the side of Palestine and on the side of Lebanon this is a peculiar situation where Israel is uh Inc caring casualities within its own borders I think from the Israeli population of and the military institutions the concern will be the ability of hisb to inflict some level of damage within Israel and uh a lot of analysts have been saying that he although his B has suffered serious blows in the past weeks it Still Remains resilient and his capacity to inflict um some level of casualities potentially very high and those costs will clearly raise political questions in Israel and probably take the debate back to whether the escalation of the conflict is really a viable strategy in terms of keeping Israel secure and uh the risk is that it is posing to the spread of the conflict into the middle east region and I mean uh the question about the Diplomatic efforts if any that are you know currently ongoing in as far as deescalation is concerned and a possibility of ceasefire it seems now like that is something that is put on hold I mean what are your thoughts around this happening we are hearing of course the United States is still now sending an advanced anti-missile system to Israel uh and and this was announced by the Pentagon sometime you know today so it seems like um there is no um opportunity here for more talks so diplomacy will definit Ely continue behind uh the scenes but I think the dimension that is taking at the moment is clearly to allow for escalation with a view that um uh the escalation the military escalation will probably erase the cost uh either for one of the conflict parties or for all the conflict parties to commit them to a a negotiated solution to end the all the second thing that you mention is the the position of the US I think I cannot remember any conflict in which uh the US has been so criticized as in this conflict for the fail for for its foreign policy failures and uh it's to many analysts the what the US is saying and what it's uh doing reflect some kind of double speak uh strengthening Israel's position in while at the same time Israel is defying what has been um at least a diplomatic ores from the Biden Administration so by sending um um these military ways that will help to probably significantly um strengthen Israel with in the context of the conflict but also in the in the Middle East the US is significantly playing into the hands of uh the netan governor which has defied Washington and taken a a very adversarial path that is based on on Military operation military operations if you want yeah so and the other countries in the in the Middle East have already you've repeatedly indicated that they are willing to concede to a peaceful plan so I I don't see though that without the US exercising it its leverage on Israel and uh drawing a a red line to say this level of militarization or military attacks cannot be accepted we need a diplomatic solution we can move forward we will have to see what happens after the US elections maybe there will be some polic change at the moment Biden looks to be committed also into strengthening Israel's hand and I mean with all of this going on Gaza is still under siege and you know with these reports of Israeli strikes hitting displaced civilians near hospitals uh I would imagine that humanitarian organizations are now finding it very difficult you know to respond to this crisis what are your observations there the the past few days have been uh shocking particularly the past two or three days I think today there were reports that uh about 60 people were were killed in in one attack they were report from un agencies which indicated that most of the of the victims are women and children I think uh slightly above 60% if I'm not mistaken um uh and it is not clear how Israel differentiates between the militants in Gaza and the civilians the attacks on public uh property or public infrastructure is shocking if all the pictures that we see of Gaza it's a basically a raised Society again this week we have been following reports about uh the lake of water basic necessities medical uh requirements and so on and they are suggesting that um Israel is actually resorting to starving the Palestinians by the way of uh pushing for a surrender kind of situation because it has failed to achieve its goals through mil military means so this calls for the International Community including the Western Community that has rallied the world around issues of Human Rights humanitarian law and so on and so on to Prevail on Israel to at least stop this kind of Adventure absolutely thank you so much uh Mr changa and for your time I really do appreciate it international relations expert Gideon chianga there for us just looking at the very latest that is happening currently in the Middle East all right this is where we wrap the show thank you so much for watching news continues right here on the Channel full View at the top of the hour from me unti Basha and the rest of the team Assurance they understand my business it's

gkK3SY2rY4U,Hartbeespoort Dam | Racial exclusion in the business sector: Kganki Matabane weighs in,2024-10-14T15:42:10Z,1610,for more this let's now welcome Kani mataban Chief Executive Officer of the black Business Council thank you so much for your time this afternoon and of course good afternoon to you so we do understand that at the heart of the matter are actually black community members who claim that they are being discriminated against and threatened by their white neighbors what is your understanding of this particular matter good afternoon and good afternoon to the viewers firstly would like to comment the the action of the Deputy minister in in trying to bring some Harmony amongst the the residents but specifically in in dealing with the issue of the 99 y b because that is the issue that is basically at at hand so we we have engaged with the the black business people there we we will be this we or next will be engaging the the white business people to try and understand from the white business people what the issues are we have had the black business people and then the bo of contention is access to the land around the water and then access to the water itself there a sense of by some of the wi residents there that they feel like they're entitled alone based on racism they entitled to operating businesses around the the water and on the land around the water but they don't necessarily like or want black people to have business there and then that has been a for example they bent a a one of The Lodges that is owned by black by black business person there for no reason and the police has so far hasn't done much to to find the trators they they also assaulted one of the like this there a few years ago a a group of white men decided to assault him mainly because he's operating a business there so there is that issue of saying people why some of the white people they feel entitled that they feel like the land belongs to themselves alone so so hence we want to get the representative to understand because as Deputy Minister said this our country we need to live together in harmony but you cannot live in harmony if there's no justice there must be Justice there must be Equitable a allocation of land to ensure that all of us we feel like this is our home and this is our place this is the place we can do business yeah and I hear you commending the deputy Minister there but given that this issue also speaks to you know systemic issues um of racism as well as the land question I mean what role do you think that the ministry of water and sanitation can play here uh we heard from the deputy Minister David mobo of course uh speaking uh about the position of the department in relation to the policy on land around the dam the the department is got a big role remember the the 9 99 year Leist was signed by the department even though it was signed during a part dat but it was signed by by by by by the department that was sued by the current one so they they they I I know that they tried to change the 99 year this they were taken to court by some of the people who don't want black people there and and then what why we're commenting him and the department in particular is that the department has basically taken that matter to to court and then they they're basically taking it making sure that ultimately that 99 year is is is repealed because if you don't repeal the legislation H you cannot get anyone there because people are going to tell you that theyve got they got 99 year list and maybe the list is expiring in in what in 5050 years from now it means we have to in in 50 years we have to then say black people are not allowed to have any business around the de so so hence it's very very important that the the 99 year L is is is canell and and the calling on because I think we've realized that the municipalities is seems to be unable to deal with the issues of the B laws and all those type of things so we're calling on the South African police and the police Ministry to ensure that those who are found guilty there de with yeah because if you don't deal with the two people the two groups that firstly BN the the business of one of the business person and the one who assaulted the like business person you're going to perpetuate because other people are going to feel like we can do the same thing and nothing will happen to them so it's important that the police asly as possible and I was going to ask you then what the role of the municipality is um but but I take your point uh as we close Mr mataban not a great line but just in terms of just your understanding then um on long-term interventions that can be implemented here especially when we start speaking about inclusive participation in the local economy because this is not an isolated incident you're correct unit this type of things are very tiring at times they they are boring but they're also tiring because it looks like black people who are woming 92% of the population in South Africa have to always justify why they belong here they have to justify why they must have businesses here have to justify where where why they must take their schools to certain places so I think I think it's government needs to then send a strong message that this country belongs to all of us H and the majority of the people who are black don't have to be justified themselves at every corner to try and and and say to the other groups that know we also belong here so it's important that government must must emphasize the message all the time starting from the president emphasizing the message that this country to all of us who are living here all right let's leave it there for now thank you so much for your time mataban is a chief executive officer of the black Business Council

b9NqX6Mo9Tg,100 days of GNU | ANC reflects on the 100 days of the GNU: Prof. Dirk Kotze,2024-10-14T14:16:45Z,3064,all right for more on this let's now welcome political analyst Professor Durk Kota Prof thank you so much for your time so let's just get your expectations then on what will be included if do you think in the anc's gnu 100 days Reflections I would imagine that ANC president s Raposa will take this opportunity to probably allay fears and those that are criticizing the party uh you know that speaks to how the anc's center is holding and not folding as a result of the G and you just your expectations Prof yes I think president R was very OB beat about the government of national Unity we saw this morning when he published his letter as as National president on his website uh he focused very much on the successes he didn't refer to any problems or eups or complications of the government of national Unity at the moment is focused very much on the economic side and I think he would do that again this afternoon I saying the optimism with respect to that the fact that uh there's growth potential now in the economy we see early uh advancements for example with respect to the uh the deathro price is certainly in a much better position for all of us um and then at the same time that is is also arguing that um though there's differences between political parties as always but it doesn't mean that it it it's is targeting the coherence of the government of national Unity so in his month there's the government of national Unity is actually performing better than what is was expected by himself as well as the public in general um I think he what he emphasized is the fact that there's a positive sentiment um amongst South Africans and that the International Community both the markets as well as the political side of the international commun Unity is is a bit about the government of national Unity so he he presents a very very positive one and I think he's going to start with that because the there are the downsides that's for example the fact that the Communist Party declined to attend this event of thec today the fact that from the left isly there's a lot of criticisms to first of all challenge the notion of a government of national Unity says they argue it's not about National Unity um it is only specific parties that are included and excludes the left the E and M um and it is then together with that and that's where the left comes in to say that it's it's it's giving too many making too many compromises with the p the public sector the private sector with businesses internationally as well as locally um and they even call it to sell yeah and I mean to that point I wanted to discuss you know um what can we read into just you know the the deferring voices as it were just on your point on the sacp saying that it will not participate in the anc's celebration of the 100 days of the gnu today but also there are other political parties who are not in the gnu who say there is going to be some sort of lack of accountability as it were uh within the gnu believing that it's a party that um or a um an alliance that does not actually believe in the hearts of what that stake for the people just on that accountability front we heard it before the 100 days we're still hearing it today what do you think then would make sense for these political parties um that are really against the gnu and saying that it really doesn't serve service anyone but those parties that are within it well I think all of them or the majority of them are members of parliament also so they are the opposition they have that the responsibility the prim rate responsibility to expose what they are talking about that they they do have many opportunities in Parliament actually to demand accountability um they are the public Representatives it's not that you must go out into communities in order to do accountability it starts in Parliament and there from there it moves onwards so I think those are critical of it has all the opportunities they they wish for um in order to present their views uh to challenge the the ministers and the members of government very directly about what they believe is not being done um and they must then at the same time present the Alternatives under the what is possible under the current conditions um and I think this this is where oppos it's relatively convenient for opposition to criticize but I think they have more of an responsibility especially in in order to put more content more substance to what argu otherwise it becomes in essence just an ideological debate between the different SES well in the main you know a number of analysts that we've spoken to say there have been some you know significant improvements um and benefits of this gnu there have also of course been some you know friction as it were uh we've seen this with the da and thec I mean just recently John Steen Hazen in his reflections of the 100 days um saying that there are four critical things that they will just not back away from and that is uh the B Bill two Clauses there that they still find contentious and as well as the nhi so just uh how do you see these frictions then playing out um over the next 100 days as it were and if they will find some form of of solid ground and and um agreements now the definition of politics is about how power is distributed uh within society and that means all the different components of power that includes the budget that includes seats in Parliament and everything and that means it's not a a very sort of placid easy process it's a pro process normally of contestation um and that continues the fact that they are in a government of nation Unity doesn't mean that all of them are going to sing from the same him book that they will have exactly the same position on all policy issues um that they will sort of as their different parties disappear in terms of their identities they continue to be thec the da the the ifp and the Patriotic Alliance and other parties with their own policies so it is a very fine balance between just serving collectively in in a coalition like the government of national unity and promoting the common policies of the government of national Unity but it doesn't mean that they must now completely move away from their own policies and we are going to see in two years time with the national uh local government elections exactly that where the different parties are going to promote their own policies again um in competition with each other and then we should not say well but this is now the end of the government of national Unity because these are the the Nuance distinctions that they have to maintain between the functioning of the government of national unity and what it does and what the different authorities con constituting the government of national Unity can do collectively as well as on their own and I think this is still a learning we are going through a learning curve all of us in respect of that so to see therefore different positions and therefore see this as already as a threat to the government of national I would say at this point is slightly premature Prof thank you so much for that analysis Professor D ca for us political analyst there of course we will take you to Luli house just to get a sense of the developments there ahead of that address byc president sir Raposa on his Reflections on the gnu 100 days in
L7ajkcjJMtE,"Hartbeespoort Dam | Mahlobo engages business owners, stakeholders on a variety of issues",2024-10-14T14:09:12Z,1012,the deputy minister of water and sanitation has engaged with the business owners here in at sport and as well as stakeholders and just to hear uh what the issues H you know were I'm now joined by the deputy Minister um just to tell us uh what really the bone of contention is the issues here in the main are stimulated about issues of the ability to coexist there are levels of intolerance that have been experienced in the past amongst community members here and it has some racial connotation but there's issues of violence where there are certain instances where people have been beaten there's also issues of criminality where there's allegation of an assen where one business property was tossed down and these are the issues that uh with the law enforcement agencies that must be dealt with our meeting was very very fruitful they came with different views we allow them an opportunity to engage now we have created a platform a platform that will be in a position to help them to find one another to have an ability to have a co-creation for this coexistence where they will have to make a decision what kind of an era they want to look over the next few years using this ability of the resources which is the dam and the land that is here to be able to have a prosperous community that is here we will then assist them that when we are in that particular meeting there's a co-creation we'll then find a mechanism to deal with issues of land use management the issues about issues of a business that can be developed then the issues of the L as a department will conclude them because we have made a determination these assets they belong to all our people whether black or white women young and old they will have access to our them for Economic Opportunity that's why we've cancelled the issues of 99 yis we've put a reasonable period so that we can open up the system we'll push on that one but at the very same time there are issues around that this Dam that has became a source of conflict rather than a source of peace and hope this dam is not in good condition when it comes to the quality of the water it has detated over time it's full of highs it has de that are there compromising even the people who are coming here as a tourist destination one of the leg will look around stting the pristin nature of this particular Dam stop the pollution clear the high there are lot of ideas that what needs to be done including the municipalities Upstream from K will deal with that particular issue there's an issue around governance and the issues of business opportunities around licensing the permitting issues we have asked the municipality to jack up his act on that particular issue when people apply for licenses there's issues of compliance about those licenses what they can do and trade including the issues of public participation is the biggest issue that is them then there are issues around bylaws enforcement what are the trading hours the issues around the complaints around the issues of noise pollution and so forth these are the matters that can be clarified and we have given the municipality to be much clearer to the communities within a space of a week they must be able to communicate and we start to do that then there's an issue around just getting the municipality to work how do we support it there's a lot of our department is doing here on water issues and we need to ensure that we deal with the minds are here but at the very same time there issues that are legal and there are issues that are part of law enforcement there are number of cases that they alleging they have been opened we want to have a sight of those case numbers will interact with the minister of police including the MC for Safety and Security in the province so that these matters they should be no stone that is left unturned so Minister Deputy Minister are you actually you know assuring that residents here that this was not just another Talk Shop this is not a talk shop this is not the first time we've interacted with the communities government does not have a solution we can create the conditions we want people to work with us that's why in our engagement here today we said let's take the journey together let's take the first step we are creating a platform that will be able to mediate around certain of the issues that are a conflict here but issues of flawlessness they have no space in our country issues of racism tribalism they will have no space in our country and as a media you will also be able to hold us accountable that's why we allowed you to have an open session rather than to be hiding this issues under the table this is how committed we are let us be judged whether are we making the first step are we making progress along the way there will be challenges but our ability and resolve to be able to speak find proposal reach each other be able to move from our original position and create a win-win situation I'm very optimistic and you could see there were traditional leaders here there were people who are from the religious frity and all of them they agree that they must be Unity they all have a sh aspiration that their children they must inherit this place in a better position and be able for the Next Generation that they able to live here
7joRaDAVdng,100 days of GNU | Ramaphosa to deliver comprehensive reflection on GNU achievements,2024-10-14T14:02:05Z,2762,ANC president s Raposa will provide a comprehensive reflection on the key achievements of the government of national Unity today the gnu comprising of 10 political parties is marking 100 days since the constituting of the 7th Administration in June the celebration will take place at the anc's headquarters in Luli house in Johannesburg this afternoon that's where will find our senior reporter Sam maso Sam a very good afternoon to you um as I opposed to political analyst Prof durka earlier I would imagine that um ANC president s Raposa in his reflection this afternoon will probably take this opportunity to elay fears as it were and the criticism that speak to how the anc's center is just not holding because of the gnu what can we expect well unti it is a bit difficult to hear you there on the line but I would assume that asking on what of the points the president of the ANC when he speaks later on this evening he will touch on I will bring in the ANC spokesperson Mrs on the essence of what the president of the ANC will be elaborating on later on this evening at 6:00 first 100 days of the jnu you are celebrating those who voted for the ANC in the elections what are some of the Highlight points that the ANC president will be speaking on later this evening yes a very slight correction which is important to do Sam the NC this afternoon is not celebrating is reflecting and accounting to the people of South Africa but having said that in terms of your to your question we expect and we know that the president will highlight how thec LED government of national unity and how thec is pursuing its elections Manifesto because remember the 6 million people and those that support thec those that voted and those that did not vote but they listened to the fact that NC committed itself to six six electoral priorities this evening we expect that we will unpack that detail let me make an example we talk about combating crime and Corruption this afternoon the president will speak about what measures practical measures have been put in place to fight the scourge of crime and as well as to fight corruption where crime is concerned we have a lot to talk about given the the improvements in policing in our country police visibility many studies are showing that there's an upward Trend um about the visibility of police in various areas we can talk about the fact that yesterday we've marked 200 days without load shedding and you probably speak about what measures we put in place to have that becoming a permanent feature in terms of energy security it's probably going to speak about the issues that are also in the public domain such as the national health insurance having um signed it into law um and and addressing the Discord from some groups about the uh the current makeup of the national health insurance and of course the B Bill where are we with that he probably speak about is it that we're going to be doing to protect transformation legislation that has been enacted since 1994 we do hear voices elsewhere suggesting that some of the transformation legislation such as the broad based economic empowerment such as employment Equity act that it must be tinkered with um and we hope that the president will address that matter because we went to the people of South Africa and said going to a government and constituting a government of national Unity as we needed to do so giving the circumstances but we committed that no transformation programs and policies are going to be reversed I still having the bilateral with the sap today that would be the officials are they still having that bilateral with the sap today the bilateral with the went to take place at 10:00 a.m. and um on the request of the on the indication by the sap and then theal could not continue I must say that thec National officials have been here since 10:00 with the expectation that there will be a bilateral we do trust and hope that there will be a bilateral soon at a time that is convenient to both the party and um thec in the meantime thec affirms its ongoing respect for the independent of the party and respect for the role and the historical mission of the triage Alliance plus one and we hope that that is the spirit that will persist even at a time when there seems to be differences about the aate government of national Unity so essentially you were snapped by the sap the a Central Committee of the weekend they said they would not be coming to Luli house for this particular reflection of the gnu have they snapped the off meeting today well I I wouldn't really use the frame the the the the the the the phrase snab because that suggests that I formulated a view about why they could not make the bilateral I think it is for the sap to clarify that further but where thec stands is that we remain committed we remain committed to this relationship and we'd like to think that all of the components of the alliance are still committed to the relationship and that we can actually go through this period and that we can work out our differences and find a a a resolution it's not the first time that there have been differences in in the alliance I recall around 2002 the anti-privatization campaign of led by KATU did cause some ractions in the alliance but they were able to come the lead leaders and membership were able to come together to iron out those differences it's it's not new to it including when the a was in Exile and and so we we are we are hopeful that we can continue with the collegial spirit that has always characterized the triata allance I remember very well in 2002i framed them as the ultra left led by man at that particular point you won't remember that that is M the spokesperson of the ANC while the sap did not Pitch at Luli house for that particular bilateral meeting that was meant to take place between the two organizations F deepening the divisions between the afan Communist party and the ANC RS that we lost saw back in 2002 and ultimately going towards the 2007 conference and ultimately going to the conference of thec where the relations between the ANC and the sacp had soured to its down the Tans particularly going back to 2002 it is back at at that similar stage now again with the sap snubbing that particular bilateral meeting with the amcu officials interesting conversation there Sam and one has to be confused with that celebration of course because of the loudspeaker behind you and the dancing but thank you so much for that of course s m in conversation there with the anc's national spokesperson saying that it is not a party for the ANC or by the ANC but merely a reflection by ANC president s Raposa this afternoon on the 100 days of the gnu of course that address byc president Raposa will happen later this evening

cTb4PnlXsfc,G20 Summit in SA | President Ramaphosa to host G20 leaders in SA next year,2024-10-14T13:17:10Z,1149,the G20 was launched in 1999 initially it was a gathering of Finance ministers and Central Bank Governors aimed at discussing International economic and financial issues the group accounts for almost 2/3 of the global population 70% of the global trade and 85% of the world's GDP South Africa has been a member of this group since its Inception in 1999 when Asia was facing financial crisis the African Union became a permanent member last year the meeting in South Africa next year comes at a time when there has been criticism that the global political tensions often derail the G20 meetings this is something Africa will have to avoid when hosting the meeting since the beginning of the Ukraine war particularly in the Indonesian presidency the was no leader Summit um well there was a leader Summit but the leaders agreement was not one that was consensus based and the ministerials all had footnotes that indicated you know the various positions that different countries have taken on that particular War um in the Indian presidency also in the ministerials there were also footnotes um but in the leader Summit there was a consensus agreement um because the the sh us just before that developed a an approach that was based on international law and that sort of brought in the agreement of all countries including Russia and the USA into an agreement based on key principles of the charter um but of course soon after that we had the the situation in Gaza and the genocide unfolding there and we found that the very same agreements that were applicable um and acceptable in the context of Ukraine is certainly not acceptable in the context of Palestine so the issue has resurfaced but I think the Brazilian presidency has taken a view and an approach that we have supported from from the beginning is that the geopolitical issues will be dealt with at a sha level a foreign minister level and the leaders level and that that allows the sectoral streams to focus on the key issues of development the African Union is now a new member of the group The G20 is a product of a crisis and it was able to manage a crisis uh the world economy was able to come out of a very major economic and financial crisis and I'm very much convinced that in spite of the challenges that I imagine it should be able to ride through these challenges and become more relevant why do I say so because initially we had the G7 uh and there was a realization that both in terms of uh output and in terms of democracy demography let me say demography there was need to really come up with a larger number of people to come up with any informal of global governance which is the the G20 and going ahead again we see those Trends continuing demograph and economic output are being spread across the world so there's that element of interdependence which no one can know granted there's fragmentation right now in the global economy but there is demand for what are called critical minerals we call them strategy minerals there's going to be demand for water demand for food and all this demand for labor all these are products of interdependence so the challenge now that faces the world Community is to say in spite of these challenges how do we hold each other and the Brazilian presidency came up with an initiative which is not going to be institutionalized but to have a meeting of foreign ministers on the margins of the G20 open to all members of the United Nations that's a spirit of inclusivity this will be the second important meeting ched by president after the successful hosting your excellen of the GLC news johbur

what is the speed that is indicated there of the vehicle there's no speed it's got 10222 indicating what that the vehicle is not moving do you confirm the correctness of your affidavit I do thank you yes yes Mr thank you good day good day good day I'm trying to adjust uh uh I want to understand that you are a police officer under the saps since 2021 is it correct that's correct so when you when you received the the section 205 you were working for the tracker Connection in 2018 is that correct that's correct so you know what capacity at tracker connect when you received this uh section 205 I was employed as the company's investigator in terms of the protocols at the tracker connect were you entitled or were you authorized to receive in section 20 205 being the investigator yes was5 when you receive the section 205 do you communicate it with your direct it was communicated to my department manager who was the direct the at that stage and even up to today one of the directors of the company will be way the so I would report to my manager and my manager was the one that would communicate to D so to know when was this tracker in fitted in the motor to know when the tracker was fitted in the motor vehicle that would show on the system on the system it will show the exact date that a unit is fitted into a vehicle but I don't have that information with me now can you stand it down and bring that information that that would have to be um asked from the company directly because I do not work for the company anymore so now I do not have access to their systems anymore that's my concern why why are you testifying on behalf of the company that you're no longer working for because I was the one that Drew the report that is being used here I'm the person that Drew the report from the system nobody else somebody else cannot speak on behalf of a report that they didn't draw from the system I don't think we'll proceed with the naked information the company must provide sufficient information before this there sufficient information that we need before we proceed we are no longer working for that company we are a member of the saps so we are not a candidate to testify on behalf of tracker connections then the court can request that from tracker do you have a fitment certificate I wouldn't have a fitment certificate because I do not fit units and I didn't even fit units the time that I was working at tracker so I wouldn't need a fitment certificate how do we know that that that car was fitted by the track Commission because it reflected on the system if we cannot see vehicles on our systems or tracker cannot see vehicles on their systems that is not fitted with their technology were you authorized by the tracker connections as a member of the saps to come and give testimony on their behalf tracker is aware of the fact that I'm testifying in this case yes they are authorization I do not have written auth authorization now do you know the serial number that is a fix on the fitment certificate I I don't know the serial number but each unit has a specific serial number and those serial numbers are captured on the system I want the serial number a specific serial number you give evidence on the registration number of a red H VI C something I need the serial number oh that reflect that that is in that fitment certificate give me that serial number I want the that can also be requested by Court from tracker certificate the name of the person who the the device that will reflect on the installation certificate a copy of the installation certificate is handed to the client and then the original is also kept so either the client or tracker will be able to supply that where was ited which town which branch all of that will show on the installation certific C so you came here unprepared according to the section 205 we were not asked about the installation certificate we were asked to supply a report from a certain date up until a certain date the section 205 doesn't ask us for the installation certificate installation certificate in terms of the National Police of the current employee which article permits you to come and testify for a previous employee the discretion of the state to call any witness it's it it's not for this witness to to to decide on on on that we submit that it's an unfair question to to this witness I'll submit my it is a fair question we submitted that this evidence of this witness is irrelevant and don't know where it is taking us to and the state is wasting the Court's time as I explained before I was the person that Drew this specific report so it again would be difficult for somebody else to come and testify on a report that they didn't draw from the system and even the statement was done by myself it wasn't done by somebody else I understand this is what You' have done you left the company you joined the public sector but to come and testify for the work we've done in the private sector this the third time that the same question is being asked we um unless my leard friend demonstrate what the reason is for repeating the same question Thrice we object to this repetitive cross examination I think I can ask it for the fifth time 10 times as long as it is relevant for what I want from this the only other alternative would be for the court to again request the same report to tracker so that another person will be able to draw the same report and then speak on behalf of the this information this document in what format does it come when it is requested by the police does it come in a PDF PDF format uh how do we know that it is not um converted into an exent we we draw it in PDF format we that is how it's generated from the system yes when it's now taken to the saps these report they get printed out at our office and the reports get handed to the police officers so at that time you were still when you I want you to be specific don't say we you say we if you are referring to a company but talk about your involvement when you received section 205 did you specifically receive section 205 yes I did did you respond to section 2055 yes I printed out a report and I printed out my statement and it was handed over to the investigating officer who is the investigating office who was the inv at the time that I received the section 205 it was a sergeant did you hand it over to did you respond to that's correct how did you respond how did you submit the document to in the form of a PDF that's correct the why that it seen now in court this is what I handed over I say how how did you send it by hand it was handed over by hand to the investigating officer at our office that was 2018 correct that's correct 2018 when it was taken by m no one else no one else ever applied for or saved with section 205 except SE in no there was no other section 2 205 served to me for this specific case no5 okay sorry my Lord I is convenient time to Adin for lunch is that so what's the time it's 1:00 okay I J until when time is asking what time it is now yeah do J until what time until two okay 2: e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e since you said you do not have the record and uh the company can still send somebody to to present evidence relating to to to the inform relating to the information about that vehicle correct yes that's correct we have uh and we don't want to be pedantic but we have repeatedly objected against um this proposition myet F has um asked this question numerous times the this witness compiled this information while she was still attached to the company and there's no reason malot that she should be um questioned at length about the fact that she's no longer working for this company is the same situation as when perhaps a doctor who was a district surgeon at a particular time treated a patient he goes into private practice and he supera to give evidence it cannot be said that now that he's in private practice cannot testify about a patient that he saw whilst he was still working for the state it's it's precisely the same situation here my concern myot is about the information that needs to be presented before this court which this witness can no longer access that information inform because she's no longer working for the company it's not about the information she has gathered at that time when she was working for the company my question ma'am is can the company still can can the company can still send somebody to present somebody can the company still send somebody to present that part of evidence which you can no longer present in court because you're no longer working for the company that's correct so what will happen tracker will have to send somebody who will then have to reprint the same report and then give evidence on that report because another person won't be able to testify on a report that I printed so they will have to reprint the report I think the last question would be your evidence basically is about the the movement of a motor not about the movement of a person now we can I can only speak on behalf of a report that I printed and the report shows the movement of a vehicle it does not show the occupants or who was driving the vehicle at that specific time it only indicates the movement of a specific vehicle thank you no question yes sir thank you yes Mr as the my Lord my Lord I don't have any questions for this okay yes yes right okay reexamination n fake yeah thank you sir sorry yes as a we are now back at the situation regarding G as indicated M today tomorrow and Wednesday he's not available sitting for the exams the first available date is the is Thursday monot as as as discussed with my colleagues uh during the uh the telephone conversation that we had with brigad ginda last week he indicated that he'll make himself available despite the fact that he's writing exams we therefore request that the matter should stand up until Thursday it will be the um the 17th if I'm not mistaken why Thursday well he's writing tomorrow and and and Wednesday as well it's in terms of that uh program that that that we submitted where's the program um I think we did me it I'm not sure if I still have a you don't have the official program a it's not an official one my lord it's the the one that we drew up when he informed us of those dayses we still waiting for the official one perhaps if we can take a short adment I'll request him to send the official one why didn't you just phone you is it home um yeah I I think he should be at the office if we take a short adment I'll quickly call you otherwise if you want the official one I can phone the professor there just to fix it to you yes no he he will send it to me he will send it to me uh initially okay Legend then all right e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e I see the state is not here it seems the is not here we've asked the register to make us copies of the time table together with Le but unfortunately the leaf didn't come out c yeah so what does but it's basically Mal with uh what we have uh communicated previously yeah so today the 14th he was the date what sitting dat 14th when he is writing yes 14th 14th of October yes 16th so another way my Lord we can only then resume on the 17th which on the 17th yeah which is Thursday is it agreeable defense that you resume on the 17th correct okay right so it will be 7 we'll be sitting on 1718 mhm yeah and um and onwards then the next exam is 26th October so it means we can sit from the 17th until about the 25th of October in fact the 24th the 24th October yes all right then the next exam it's on the 12th of uh November that means we can sit up until the 10th of November of November yes then the second last exam is 20 November which means we can then sit from from the 13th of uh November today until the 18th then the last exam is on 25th November meaning then we can sit from the 20th of uh 21st of November until 23rd this is more or less the program that I sent to my colleagues before we adjin for the uh for the recess so the next session of this court will be on the 2 on Thursday this coming Thursday thday the 17th the 17th yes okay and then the 18th yes 17 and 18 okay so 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 uh um no until yes in need minute until the 12th of November he's writing on the 12 so he's entitled to a day before he right so that will be until the 10th of November so after it will be 17 18th when we're sitting 1718 then um 21 22 21 23 24 is writing again on the 26th of October so we can only sit up to 21 until 24 so 17 18 21 22 23 and 24 and 23 and 24 yes then what happens there after then he's entitled to a day before he rides he rides on the 26th which is a Saturday Saturday yes so it's entitled to the 25th yeah so we we we end on the 24th the next time we come when um so the next sitting session will be the 28th 28th yes 28th of October oh I see right that's it yes 28th of October until the next exam it's on the 12th of November so it'll be 28th up until about the 10th of uh November so in fact the 10th of November it's is it's a Sunday so we can only sit up to the 8th of November okay fine so be adjusting it as we go along yes okay fine are the arrangements satisfactory

qdZgkU8RpL0,2024 Matric Exams | NSC exams to start on 21 October: Prof. Brahm Fleisch weighs in,2024-10-14T12:50:37Z,392,"for more on this lesson now welcome Professor Bram aash the professor of Education policy at the V School of Education Prof a very good afternoon to you so the country's qualifications and education quality assurance body umalusi not too long ago says you know while it's all systems go ahead of this exams there are some weaknesses they've identified during the equality assessments but will likely be corrected just before the exams begin with nearly 900,000 matriculate sitting in these exams what are some of your observations Prof so I mean this is an very important a moment for those 900,000 young people it has a culmination of 12 Years work it involves hundreds of thousands of teachers and parents this huge amount of anxiety their future is right in it and it is a a national um it is a national um event that takes place and we all look forward to it with both trepidation and excitement so I think you know it's a high stakes issue I'm very pleased to hear that the Mec has put in place a whole range of New U measures to ensure that there is no unauthorized use of electronic devices uh there's no doubt that there is high stakes in this event and there will be some children who believe that they can try and circumvent the existing regulations but I think that many of the steps that have been taken will address at least um will definitely address the issues that are being raised and I mean I want to just hang on to that high stakes and trepidation comments that you've made I mean one of the issues that has always tainted these exams is cheating for one um and also of course we heard there from you know the Mec that um they have plans in place for any Community interruption since load shedding was another Factor but we now know we have been 200 days without load shedding so that seems to be in the past but how much of a factor you know particularly when we look at cheating um is this then on the credibility of the exams and do you think that you know the Department of Education has been able to handle this so we've run exams very successfully for the last 30 years years there were obviously big issues in 1996 when the new departments took over the exams there was a breach in that year and the following year there had been periodical um challenges in quaza Nal and other provinces it's obviously there will be places where the rules are not followed strictly but I think overall the sou African exam systems have run very effectively over the last three decades and that the issues when they do arise and inevitably in a system of this scale with so many different players and complexities there will be issues that arise but I think that the ability to monitor what's happening to identify potential places where there is possible irregularities those will be those will be addressed um as as they are identified and when we talk about um and I want to just touch on just the quality of this paper of course uh many years when we see these results being announced uh towards the end of the year beginning of of the next year um there's a lot of emphasis in terms of just this discrepancies in terms of quality of of the papers where we compare it to the National senior certificate exams but also IB as well as of course uh the other you know um uh modes of of Education that we have here in in in our um in our country but how would you then characterize just the academic approach in terms of the quality of teaching as well as the quality of learning so you know there's huge variation variability across the country um we have schools where all the Learners not only have completed the exam successfully but get a bachelor pass or other schools where they'll be very happy if three quarters of the children receive a minimum B basic pass so there's huge variability and that has to do with um a range of different factors support that children get within the home the quality of the teaching in the school the kinds of resources that they have access to and the extra support so I think you know there's no doubt that there is huge variation across uh schools across within schools across provinces um and I think that you know obviously one of the things that have been the focus of of provincial governments and schools and and districts is to try and address particularly the challenges of children in the schools that have historically not done so so so well and the real story in The Matrix is that over the last three decades there's been significant improvements particularly in the most disadvantaged provinces in some of the most disadvantaged districts and schools and the proportion of children who are now reaching the minimum B Benchmark for successfully completing the national senior certificate has improved there are still big challenges I think that um some of the the biggest problems we have are in in mathematics in science where we haven't seen a substantial increase in the number of children getting higher marks in those subjects but overall the picture across the country is both of stability within the management of the exams and Improvement of results particularly in historically disadvantaged communities well that's very encouraging to hear Prof especially when we also highlighting the uh quality of the education in the lower grades and that is speaking to of course um your Junior schools but thank you so much Prof for your time and your comments of course uh Professor Bram flash is a professor of Education policy at the vit School of Education for"
A1ZrPNul0jY,100 Days of GNU | ANC marks 100 days of the Government of National Unity: Paul Mashatile,2024-10-14T12:28:43Z,7248,ANC president suram posa is going to be providing a comprehensive uh reflection on the key achievements of the government of national Unity later today the gnu comprising of 10 political parties is marking 100 days since the Constitution of the 7eventh administration now with that we're now going to cross live to the the deputy president Paul mashati uh he is speaking to the media says because I'm sure all of you will agree that uh uh since the setting up of the gnu the government of national Unity uh the country is stable there's a stable government government that is working uh so so we are happy about that uh there were those who thought that maybe the new government because it came from 10 parties there are going to be squabbles and quarrel and and so on but in fact the truth is that all those parties are working well together we actually see ourself as one team uh so when we are in cabinet and we are doing our work we don't say Okay me I'm from thec you are from the Patriotic Alliance or the da we just say we are a GNU Team all the ministers are able to the president and uh the president is the only Commander in Chief so he's the one that appoints the ministers give them tasks and then we all account to the president so if you were to ask me is the gnu working the answer is yes it is the government at work will it Last 5 Years yes of course because the the the statement of intent was a foundation that was laid to take us over the Journey of 5 years so that's what we are planning to work together for the next coming years until we end the 10 successfully if there are challenges we will deal with them uh some of you might even know that uh 3 weeks ago the leaders of the GMU met and they agreed that we must have a structure which will be shared by myself that will look at any issues that needs to be attended to if there are issues where maybe we don't agree about this or that that structure will deal with those issues all the leaders will recommend or or propose uh people to serve in that structure our first meeting will be this coming Thursday in Cape Town where I will meet with all the leaders of the other parties and deal with the issues that they are concerned about whether it's a bill up a act or nhi or any other matter that they may want to deal with it will come to that we call it the clearing house uh so the Clearing House will be headed by myself it will it will make sure that by the time the leaders meet the issues have been dealt with so that the gnu must remain stable and focused at work thank you very much for uh coming here the president will also talk to you later but uh we are happy that uh all is good uh things are working and we want to make sure that we keep it that way thank you very much uh Deputy president with that I am going to look for those who wish to fire away new new room followed by power thank you very much it'sand from News Room Africa um you've speak spoken about the structure called Clearing House so there's the issue of uh issues of policy but then there's also personal issues such as the da uh basically targeting you in your personal capacity Deputy president do you think that that also has the potential to bring but also do you believe um that President s r is right to say that the Coalition will Outlast him and given the fact that you're going to have an elective conference in 2027 presumably you also have your own Ambitions okay maybe let's take two questions okay I'll take and then we'll take more later yeahi from Power news Mr Deputy president um since now there's a dis a dispute resolution to speak about the conflicts happening in the um how will the ANC handle the situation between the tensions between da Federal chairperson Helen Zilla andc that of course has spilled over to the government of provincial Unity which says it doesn't exist so how is the party handling the inter conflicts between the da and the okay uh first question we are working very well with uh all members of of the gnu um there are no quels so far uh and the the second layer which I call the clearing house is not just to deal with disputes in a sense it's an a structure that must deal with issues for instance one of the issues we are going to look at as that structure is the the hosting of the G20 next year so we'll discuss it in that structure and advise the the leaders on how we think we should manage the G G20 as South Africa uh so when we're in that structure we're not dealing about uh you know small quarrels there and there in fact the The Da in government has not raise any issue about me um whether they'll raise it at some point wherever I don't know but it's not an issue at the moment we're focusing on governance we are all looking at making South Africa work so that our people can benefit we are happy that we are putting low shedding behind us we are now pushing to have transmission lines to make sure that this generation is working transmission is working infrastructure broadly is working so we are very focused uh so so the the issues about tensions really don't exist with uh Helen zil and pazza well I'm sure they will resolve those issues as far as we are concerned we said to the government of of of Hing led by thec if the da doesn't want to work with you in hting leave them behind it's not your problem uh and they must not make it our problem nationally because we are working well with them nationally it's up to the DA to make sure they work well with our structures in the provinces we want our structures to work with them but our structures came to us how came to us and say the da is making impossible demands and therefore we can't proceed and we said to them well leave them behind if they are not reasonable go without them but doesn't mean that we don't want to work with the da all I'm saying that all parties must be reasonable in what they want in what we do because you know the gnu can't survive if people come with unreasonable demands uh so far it's surviving because all of us are mature we are dealing with issues in a matur way and it's going to be like that uh we we will finish the 5 years yes sir thank you very much DP I'm going to I'm going to go this way started on the left and now I'm proceeding uh to the right my brother over there and then said BC shanon Mar broadcasting Africa all protocol of it's good to see you live who are in good health in good so we are happy to see that ourselves yes um my question is the gnu uh what it took 14 days to negotiate the gnu took 30 days to appoint the Min during those 30 days the country didn't go into there was no Army General H DG that overrule the president and say no we're going to fight and so on and what in government even K deployment people that are K deployment as they call it they kept the country going what do you say to those loyal you know in another country in Africa in 14 days there would have been civil law what do you say to the dgs the HS that kept the country going without the politician okay because it's a long question let me do it fine uh if if I was to answer you in Zulu I would have said to the public servants oh the guy says I'm look the side now I don't know you will capture me okay no he was asking me what is my view about the public service because in the period where we negotiating the government was stable it was working I'm saying we we we thank the public service uh for focusing because indeed going forward we want to have a professional public service we don't want to have H public servants who are worried about politics they must leave politics to us theirs is to do the work that they are hired to do and I'm happy that they did that the country continued to work the dgs did their work the chief directors the directors everybody and that's what we want to see going forward the public service must be professional must focus on the work the politicians will deal with the politics um and that's really the future that we want to see in South Africa so thank you very much uh my brother for that question we are happy and we thank the public servants keep it that way thank you very much sac some picture of the GM part the Friday inlec on the G and actually up all their ministers to actually account what their success and achievements were quite interesed in knowing what the achievements of thec over these days are and furthermore what do you make of the public facts of the L leaders um in public in G lately the kinal secretary Mr had called Mr the well let me let me put it this way that it's not going to be easy to take the public SPS away immediately uh but it it must not worry us people will always differ in the way they see things uh all we need to do is focus on work you are quite right that the da ministers were reporting to the DA about what they are doing our ministers are also reporting to us about what they are doing but our approach is that there is one government uh and that's why the president when he speaks today is going to speak about the success of the government not thec ministers the success of the government because the government is not just ANC now we are 10 parties so when the president speaking will say the government of national Unity has done the following you are saying what do I see as an achievement as the ANC when we went to the election there was serious load shedding country was worried know people didn't want to vote we have now fixed a lot of things to ensure that 200 days now no Lo sheding and we want to keep it that way uh we are fixing escom uh we making sure that the sufficient generation uh we've just finalized uh the appointment of the transmission company as you know they are going to be going out on tenders to get the transmission live that's 14 14 km of transmission line that must be installed which will Pro probably cost about 350 billion r that is already in place the infrastructure we are looking at transet now new coo has been appointed that we are looking at fried rail to fix it roads so we are we are at work and we are going to professionalize the public service train people and make sure that we have people in the public service who are fit for purpose that we do as the government of national unit thec is there so as the government of national Unity succeed we as African National Congress will also be able to claim the success of the gnu if the gnu fails it means we fail ourselves so it's important that as thec we must whilst we will hold our ministers accountable but the president will hold all ministers accountable of the gnu because it is in the interest of thec for the gnu to succeed thank you thank you very much uh de this will be all right so that's Deputy president Paul mashad they're briefing the media ahead of President Sosa speaking later about Reflections on the gnu after a 100 days P mashad they're saying that they are united they don't see each other as political parties but as members of one government that seek to deliver for South Africans for
rjV3swBr-sA,ActionSA is briefing the media in Parliament,2024-10-14T11:44:12Z,8661,"good morning to each and every one of you I greet you in the name of the god of our for Bears the beneficent the merciful it is truly my honor this morning and privilege to be here today as we reflect on the first 100 days of action's parliamentary caucus performance and offer a critical review of thec L government of national unity's seventh Administration my name is in these first 100 days actiona has made it clear in Parliament that we are not here to play Politics as Usual our party stands firm in our duty to hold this government accountable to push for solutions that genuinely serve our country and challenge any failure to deliver on the mandate to change our people's lives we were elected by South Africans who are tired of excuses tired of corruption and tired of being forgotten by those in power the gnu 7th Administration however has already shown signs of failing into the falling into the same old patterns inefficiencies lack of transparency and failing to be robust in the stuns to put South Africans first but actiona has not set back in silence we have led robust engagements in committees tabled motions that put South African Centric and continue to hold the government accountable on every front from the collapsing state of Public Services to the ongoing failure to curb corruption our work is just beginning in these next few months and Beyond we will continue to be the people's voice we will demand Integrity in governance and push forward the agenda of economic Revival the rule of law and justice for all South Africans and so today we present not just a review but a clear signal that actiona remains Relentless in our Comm in our commitment to building a better future for our country we are here to lead to fight for real change and to give South Africa a government that works for the people and not against them with these few words let me introduce my esteemed Super Six colleagues who have demonstrated that we have the gumption that is required to do this work I am proud to lead this team alongside our parliamentary caucus chairperson and he is to

commitment to the journey and also um how the first 100 days have gone for them so far as well as um projects and issues that they will be championing going forward for thank you all very much let me welcome to the floor The Honorable e trol very dramatic you're very thank you very much uh our party chairperson says very melodramatic With the Wind well the wind is is hectic out there thanks very much for coming uh as lato said everyone will introduce themselves and give some reflection so I'll start with that it'll be very brief uh I've spent 20 years as an elected public office Bearer prior to coming to Parliament now in 2024 and uh it was an interesting St time I served on all four spheres of government District Council provincial legislature Parliament and the local Council in Nelson Mandela Bay and uh I come to the end of my political um work I thought until um Herman maaba and Michael invited me to a meeting in Johannesburg and basically tried to convince me to come and join them to help them fix South Africa I'll truncate that discussion because it was a long meeting and a long discussion and uh at the end of it I I said to Herman mashaba thanks very much but uh I've had enough and his response basically was have you done enough and I reflected on that the most profound political question I've ever had on the way home and I realized that I come from a broken province in a broken Society actually and that I clearly had not done enough and I found myself back in Parliament to make sure that one day when I do stop doing what I'm doing I can say that I did enough so that's an in incredible privilege and a great challenge to me and I'm very happy to be fulfilling it back in Parliament uh what I found very attractive to join this party action essay was Herman masab and his p colleagues started this party through a people's dialogue and got um many many South Africans encouragement to start something new to offer those homeless and disillusioned members of other political parties something different and I'm uh as I said honored to be part of that something different and we're going to talk today about what it is that we offer that is different we came to Parliament with six members Which is less than what we expected but more than what many other political part parties that have been around for 30 years have in Parliament so it was uh disappointing somewhat but what hasn't been disappointing is the caliber of colleagues that I serve with in Parliament and uh our work to date has not gone unnoticed so I'm going to run through um what we have achieved what we focusing on doing in the future and this um statement is available to you but let me just say that we took an oath 122 days ago that we would serve our country and we would honor the Constitution and uh it's been about 100 days uh that the new government of national Unity stroke Grand Coalition has been in power and uh we promised to be a constructive opposition and I believe that we fulfilled that promise to date we also occupy a really important rational Center in Parliament I believe uh we now have a government that has nearly 7 20% control of parliament which is a massive block powerful Block H and a block that can easily abuse their powers in Parliament and in opposition we have a new political party that doesn't appear to have any strategic Direction other than opposing their former colleagues and we have the eff uh that has been around for 10 years but seems to have lost some of its direction so they uh masquerade as the progressive caucus with other members of from other political parties when in actual fact they are more like a regressive caucus so our position in between those two blocks is a really important position and something that we believe South Africa needs at every opportunity action SAA has shown that we do not take our representation in Parliament lightly we've utilized every available parliamentary mechanism to ensure that the voices concerns and aspirations of ordinary South Africans are Amplified in Parliament the majority of our caucus have never served in Parliament and I think that's what one of our major strengths is because they are professional people that come from all walks of life and they bring that professionalism and passion to their work in Parliament we've our caucus has made presentations or representations in every committee where members simultaneously scrutinized annual performance plans budget presentations and making submissions on multiple uh committees each one of us serves on two committees but as you know you cannot be in two places at once but some of us have shown that you can almost do that Dr leape I think attended every one of the budget committees um and he made a profound impact and has now become a household personality and certainly a parliamentary personality we've committed as I said to being a constructive opposition and our voting record on the July appropriation cycle Dem Straits our balanced approach we supported 26 budget votes while maintaining principal OB ctions to 15 of them I overheard one of the members of the gnu actually commending us in a sitting where they said now that's proper opposition where we didn't like other opposition parties oppose every budget we supported those that we could and we opposed those that we couldn't and I think that's the role of a an effective constructive opposition when you consider our relative size we have written 100 questions to the executive for their reply and it demonstrates that we have maximized every limited opportunity for questions provided to uh To Us by the Parliamentary rules actions has been present in every parliamentary plenary session we've posed questions to every cabinet cluster during executive question and repair sessions and used every opportunity available to us and I think that's the yard stick of a good opposition party you might not be able to reach everything but you must use every available opportunity we have coined the phrase that we are the super six and uh our president told us we must come to Parliament and perform like we are 60 I mean that's one hell of a yard stick and challenged but we have done well I believe um since our election on the seventh Parliament actions has made a number of key observations about the work of Parliament and the need for Urgent reforms to improve its functions as the Bastion of democracy uh the true measure of parliament's Effectiveness lies in holding the EXE cutive to account and when the executive adopt adversarial postures it's up to us to counter that and do whatever we can to prevent that kind of political majoritarianism that we've seen for 30 years in South Africa which still prevails incidentally of concern is the urgent need for the deputy president who is the leader of government business to make sure that that we hold him to account and to make sure that the ministers who come and answer questions in Parliament come properly be prepared and give us proper answers unfortunately we've seen the bad habit of simply giving rudimentary cursory responses in Parliament continuing even in the seventh dispensation to address the fact that uh the current executive isn't accounting properly we will continue to ensure that we are active participants participants in both parliament's programming committee and rules committee and will further engage with the speaker to ensure that these matters are remedied so that we can maximize our Effectiveness in that regard our chief Whip lorato and GOI plays a very significant role she has a strong track record of management and leadership in her previous life and she has displayed that magnificently in those committees over the last 3 months actions has shown a fierce appetite for holding the grand coalition to account and this includes leading the charge to hold the Minister of Justice accountable writing numerous letters to the president the public protector and the speaker and I want to just say in that regard it's sometimes very difficult to do the right thing but you have to do the right thing if you've committed to doing that and we will hold this minister to account to the very last uh opportunity that we have we tried the president no response we tried the speaker no response we tried the public protector no response we've laid criminal charges but we're not going to stop there because on Thursday this week the president's coming to Parliament and I'm going to be asking him what he's going to do about his Minister who has this cloud of controversy hanging over ahead we have um in various committees and through direct correspondence with ministers our members have interrogated departments and state functionaries focusing on ensuring that we Elevate the issues impacting our communities to the responsible authorities this work has ensured that South Africans have direct access to government last night dar James told us that she championed the fact that in elderado park where she comes from there were no police vehicles she tells me that on Tuesday two brand new police vehicles will be delivered to the Eldorado Police Station now that's the kind of work that proper MPS do they don't just point fingers they make sure that where there is a deficiency that the deficiency is addressed and that is the kind of work that we expect from each other in this ccus recently uh maloe joined the minister and the deputy president in guani and Limpopo where she comes from because the people of guani have not had water for many many years and the project cost have ballooned out of out of complete I don't know sanity to something incredible yet they don't have water they don't all have water the deputy president was trying to tell us about the fact that the people of guani have water it's not true some people in gani have water but the whole Giani Community still does not have water um our members have shown a passionate commitment to their portfolio committees and this last week doing oversight was an eyeopener for them as new members of parli parliament and they have realized how important it is to actually go and see for yourself what's happening on the ground um our immediate priority uh in Parliament is around ethics and accountability ethical leadership is a key tenant of action essay informed by a belief that you cannot build a house on stable foundations our arrival in Parliament has revealed that the rot runs much deeper than we ever anticipated with profligacy and excessive perks indicative of a system that has departed from one of Public Service to one that prioritizes self-service and extravagance and what has become apparent is that even those political parties who pretended to oppose uh this profligacy previously have succumbed to it and moved into it rather seamlessly and comfortably so we will be uh looking at updating the ministerial handbook that uh is related to our bloated cabinet that cost this country more than a billion Rand annually and we will make sure that the necessary changes are brought to that our chief whip Leni is also making sure that we will address the issue the Luna that has arisen with people that are compromised being elected to Parliament we want to make sure that people who are compromised Beyond bankruptcy and uh non- rehabilitated insolvency or people who have been sentenced to jail for more than a year that it is ex includes people that have been impeached from high public office serving as members of parliament so lorat will be driving that uh in Parliament because there is a kandum currently around Dr John chope and uh Minister not Minister Member of Parliament Quan from the eff to this end we've already written to the parliament's Joint constitutional Review Committee to call for a thorough review of applicable legislation rules Frameworks to ensure that elig eligibility standards for public office bearers are consistent and transparent some people didn't understand our press statement in this regard we want to make sure that we do not have members of parliament that are compromised rather than having a debate whether a compromised Member of Parliament can attend a committee or not that is expost Factor we need to make sure it doesn't happen our medium-term priority is focused on fighting Dee rooted corruption in society and in government by every available indicator corruption remains rampant and to date the grand Coalition has done nothing legislatively to combat it they have done nothing legislatively to combat it actions believes that there's an urgent need for reforms starting with a constitutional amendment to establish a new chapter 9 anti-corruption agency we will champion this in Parliament we will encourage and canvas the support of other political parties and those parties that won't support us we will expose them for their comfort in corruption cognizant of the high thresholds for such amendments today we make a public claran call to all parties to get involved and to support us longterm in line with our core value of non-racialism and inclusive economic growth long-term economic reforms are crucial to SP grow spur growth and effectively address the legacies of our past our country faces economic stagnation impoverishing our people while the government seems paralyzed with the left foot not knowing what the right foot's doing and the uh gnu has compounded that confusion as far as we're confirmed concerned we've seen a lot of tiptoeing in the gnu uh around principal position that parties held before they joined the gnu we are going to focus on inclusive economic empowerment we've got some very specific ideas around that around a universal basic income stimulus the opportunity fund and uh alen Beasley Will Champion the economic policies and the opportunity policies of action sa so if you want to know anything about that please contact alen he is the champion of the people that are oppressed because we don't have enough money he's also Champion the fact that SARS is underfunded and they under collect revenue and without Revenue you can't run a proper government that cares for South Africans action sa will further propose a tiered system for minimum wage and tax incentives for companies these incentives would allow for businesses to claim 110% of wages paid to historically disadvantaged groups as an operational expense rather than relying on racial quotas this approach aims to increase employment opportuni and Foster company growth in the current term action sa under the leadership again of lat GOI intends to introduce a reserve sector bill that fundamentally reforms our 900 billion Rand Township economy that is currently dominated by undocumented foreigners if I can put it euphemistically she is championing a policy of spares for locals it's not about spares it's about a 9 billion Rand economy that is not in the hands of South Africans and poor South Africans that need it and that should be running it and we want to transform that lastly uh action SAA believes that these key legislative priorities as I've outlined will set the tone for bold and necessary reforms to Place South Africa on the path towards growth and the entrenchment of good government's principles in keeping with our commitment to being a constructive opposition action SAA is not merely in opposition to howl and reject but to engage and propose sound Alternatives in that regard right next to me is the chairperson of action sa Michael Bowmont who's now going to give you a perfect example of how you can be in opposition and be constructive and be objective and how you can effectively hold a government to account Michael Bowman will take us through our gnu performance tracker platform that he is introducing thank you Michael I think everybody knows that I'm I'm not you so you can definitely take that greetings and welcome uh to members of the media my colleagues from action say and most importantly those South Africans following these proceedings from home I think uh you'll all agree with me when I say Parliament has become a place where the opposition has died in South Africa and this is why we have such incredibly important work to do for Action say and I'm reminded of a very important quote uh that was attributed to Winston Church in the second world war when it said never has so much been owed by so many to so few and when you think think about the work that these six members of parliament are going to have to do in holding accountable a Colossus of a 70% GMU I think that saying becomes entirely apt I want to remind colleagues here that action essay is not outside of the GN because of an accident we took a very conscious decision not to join the gnu and we conveyed that decision to thec at the time after the 29 May elections to say that we are deeply concerned concerned about what happens when the opposition gets co-opted into government what happens when the watch dogs are now driving around in German sedans with that soft soft leather and they aren't able to be the Watchdogs any longer cuz if you believe that power corrupts within my goodness 70% power is going to corrupt most absolutely and this is where we need a strong opposition in South Africa uh and as a my colleagues already indicated uh that opposition is going to have to arise from a six seat party because is not going to arise from the official opposition or the eff we need a constructive opposition in this country I think it's important to note that the 9th of October last week marked officially 100 days of this gnu Grand Coalition depending who you talk to and it becomes necessary for us to take stock as a country and one of the reasons why it's become necessary is you can't deny that there's a national optimism that National optimism is very clear wherever you go but the question is is whether that optimism is based on anything tangible that we can hold in our hands and we can believe because we need to understand that this wouldn't be the first time South Africans had placed their hope in something that turned out to be hopeless in 2009 South Africans placed their hope in Jacob Zuma and for an initial period anyway criticism of Jacob Zuma was seen to be a bad thing in 2018 they placed their hope in civil ramapa and in the beginning the president could do no wrong and you could see where that turned out so I wouldn't be mistaken to say that the gnu could be the third time bitten uh type scenario around which we need to be alive as a country to certain realities that are starting to emerge as alarming patterns in our country in relation to this government and particularly of concern is the fact that we're now seeing multi-party delivery of the same old politics that was voted out in the 2024 elections political parties hor traded around how they would vote on the Pala Pala issue as part of their negotiations parties had once said we need a smaller cabinet now form part of the biggest cabinet in South African history the Bella act has been passed nhi is moving through swiftly and believe it or not people are breathing life back into the secrecy bill in the year 2024 cada deployment continues unabated as a matter of fact the opposition now participates in it with memos asking for leniency on the minimum standards required to appoint people and now you have a Justice minister implicated in the v their Saga giving the president a pass on his Saga and palaa I would say the time for opposition's never been more than now and what we are growing increasingly concerned about and which has led us to the point where we believe a Tracker of government performance is necessary is it looks like we have an Instagram government that has emerged in South Africa a government that tends to make announcements and tweets more than it does in terms of policy or legislative reforms in a real way so we will read that there's now a war against the construction Mafia is there has anyone been arrested have there been any investigations the same goes for borders we have the minister abah hambe who is now participating in a government that has demonstrated that it spends and I quote 200 million Rand a year in deportations of people who should not be able to enter our country if there was a properly managed border we have people saying that this is going to be the fight against corruption but when they go and sit in their cabinet they sit against those sit next to those implicated in corruption and now of late you now start to see what I now call metronomics the tendency of having ministers who obviously have not had the benefit of studying economics taking on the credit for the international oil price so when the fuel price comes down that's the gnu but when the Justice ministers implicate mevious no no that's not us but you can't have it both ways you can't be fish and foul you have to stick to your principles and I think what we're seeing is a real concern that in the place of real reforms that we should be seeing we're seeing short-term gains claiming credit for things that do not belong here the difference between correlation and causation the fact that something happens while you are here doesn't mean it happens because you are here and I think the biggest concern that we seeing right now is the silence around the July policy lla we were told that this Grand Coalition was going to a lla in July to announce policy reforms and ever since then it has been radio silence what reforms have emerged which direction is our economy going to go in how are we going to defeat crime in our country with reforming our Criminal Justice System these issues are just silent and that's why the work that we are doing is so important in announcing this tracker today because if this government is not going to tell us what is its strategy in which direction is it going and how we should hold them accountable in terms of their KPS that job now Falls to The Unofficial opposition of South Africa and that's what we are going going to be spending a little bit of time talking about today so behind me you will see a website which is freely accessible to the South African people and we will Avail it to you members of the media it will become a point of reference so that ever you are looking for a factual report on this government's performance rather than an emotional one you will see it there and you will see all of this data that has been established with the intention of creating a baseline of where we are right now as a country and where we will be going going forward as these statistics come out over the course of the next 4 and A2 years and in so doing we can actually have a situation where the priorities and the key performance indicators of our country are being defined because the government is clearly not undergoing that task so the first will come as no surprise it's unemployment and we don't use the narrow definition because people who are discouraged work Seekers because of a failing economy are absolutely unemployed like everybody else and as a matter of fact you will see that this is a trend that continues to move in the wrong direction and we hope deeply that it turns around let me be very clear actions does not rejoice in any of these statistics these statistics represent the hurt and pain of South Africans and their families we must be very cognizant of that as we go through these numbers but there can be no government that claims any success as long as this graph is moving in the wrong direction CP Pi inflation has started to move in the right direction and when we call ourselves a constructive opposition is not here just to tell you what is wrong that has started to move in the right direction for the first time in a very long time but we must ask ourselves the question is it moving in the right direction because of anything of this government or are we looking at a decline in inflation arising from the reduction of the oil price from the international price of Brin crude these become important things and we will continue to track going forward because as long as it is more and more expensive for the South African family to be a family then we're going to have to be a strong opposition to behavior that drives that go in the wrong direction support offered to small businesses this is not our favorite statistic the South African government likes to track processes and not outcomes but nonetheless what we're seeing is that 2023 was a very very bad year for the annual number of small businesses supported by the state through loans and this is going to be something we're going to have to monitor very carefully because any science behind how we grow our economy knows that the backbone of a growing economy is small business we move on to perhaps some of the most important ones economic growth currently at 0.4% a debt to GDP ratio of 72.2% and foreign direct investment uh facilitated by the state of 16.6 billion round these numbers all have to change uh in a very serious way before any government can start to claim any level of success around our economy the next statistic is a good one and one that we celebrate very much because it's one of the few things that are moving in the right direction and we give credit where it is due the minister of energy has done an outstanding job with his team at escom and for the first time in a long time so the Africans are experiencing reprieve from the power outages that dominated our lives for so long this will become an important thing for us to continue monitoring though because the goal is to keep the power on longterm for the South African households and for the businesses they're going to be needing to move some of those other critical kprs that we mentioned to you earlier the next one is about how many households are still using bucket toilets it is an important statistic as it talks about an important part of our Social Development strategies and currently 371,000 this indignity and this is something we will continue to track going forward because it is a vital measurement of how government is supposed to improve the dignity in the lives of those who are most vulnerable violent crime rates becomes the next important kpr principally focusing on murders and sexual offenses which has been one of the greatest challenges in our Criminal Justice System those graphs have been moving in the right direction over the last 12 months but it's very important to note that there's always a very sign ific question around what we are measuring this against is it being measured against all crimes committed or is it measured against all crimes reported and as people lose faith in their criminal justice system and the police that starts to become more and more of a reality important though is that we need to see reforms in the sector for us to believe that these numbers are not just about reports but actually about changes in our Criminal Justice System the next kpr unresolved high-profile corruption cases and let's be clear ladies and gentlemen this problem is never going to get better as long as the Justice portfolio is presided over by a minister who has massive unanswered questions in this particular department but while there were over 300 cases in May uh 2024 that has now risen to over 400 unresolved high-profile cases of corruption in October 2024 this is clearly an indicator moving in the wrong direction and what we R way to see is whether this GNU is going to hold itself accountable and deal with a scenario where you sit next to people in your cabinet meetings who are the subject of these investigations as much as their other colleagues youth literacy rate becomes the selected criteria for our education uh kpi focusing on a dynamic that since 2019 there's been a decline in youth literacy and we want to make sure that the interventions of the this government and the minister in particular is focusing on youth literacy as a vital measurement of the success of our education system new HIV infections is a graph that has been moving in the right directions year on year but there's a very ambitious Target set of those infections being lower than 8,800 by the year 2028 just four years away which looks highly unlikely when you look at where we are right now and this will become an important indicator I think we're very great for to have someone of Dr clapz caliber to assist us in understanding the interventions that are going to be required to drive this number in the right direction our ports management becomes a vital part of our infrastructure measurements ultimately the South African ports have slid down uh in Durban to 398 in the world and Cape Town 45th in the world which I believe is officially listed as the worst port in the world now this as you can understand has got to be a vital part of our infrastructure turnaround and any extent to which an infrastructure portfolio is spending its time while this is being allowed to continue is a very serious question mark around the Strategic priorities the freight rail performance has doubled in the wrong direction in 2023 the average Freight was 309 minutes over the target time it's now 779 minutes over the target time and that is moving in the wrong direction as well I need to stress that we are going to continue to build this tracker over time to include other important kprs that don't arise from official government reports but do arise from for example from our questions in Parliament our MPS are posing questions every day that will tell us how much is being spent on international travel because I'll notice that this government is not just an Instagram government it's a jet setting Instagram government it's traveling the world every single day with very large entourages and we need to see what that's costing the South African people and what returns they are getting for it we want to see the cost of blue lights we heard there were going to be no blue lights but it seems to be a lot of blue lights we want to know exactly who is using those and who is not and we already noticed that our parliamentary question to find that question out was refused they would not tell us the answer as to which ministers are are not using blue lights now this is supposed to be a government that is reforming our country but that is the kind of Sten gr style politics that we thought we had done away with in South Africa a long time ago I wonder if all those people who supported parties in this GMU would support the idea that we can't find out who's using blue lights and who is not interesting I think the important point to say is this if you are to grade this Grand coalition government in its first 100 days the grade would be an e because there has been no strategy Direction in our country there has been no no revision of the NDP there's been no setting of national priorities as a matter of fact it looks like individual parties in the Coalition are setting their own priorities separate from government can you imagine there is not a clear set of outcomes based KP so that we can all understand what is the scoreboard we need to understand what the priorities of our country are and where we're going to invest in change and in the process what are the non priorities from which we must take money so that the prior ities get funded but at the same time you got to tell the South African people what is the scoreboard what are we measuring if these are the strategies and priorities what are we measuring to determine what success and failure looks like and the fact that this government is continuing where others have before it to operate in a manner that is not wanting to be held accountable that becomes a very serious concern and what about the policy and legislative reform agenda because all the tweets and Instagram posts and the world are not going to change the fact that government operates by policy and legislation if you're not changing those things and moving those things in the right direction you continue to have a multi-party delivery of the old agenda that got voted out in 2024 and I think from our point of view as I wrap up ladies and gentlemen you will continue to see that this tracker will develop we invite you members of the media and South African people to continue to access its information and to monitor its progress because we must never be so eternally grateful to a government because of what it avoided that we do not hold it accountable for its performance thank you thank you Michael colleagues I'm back um I think I must just be upfront and truthful about the fact that this moment for our organization action say is such a historic moment and I think I speak for all of my colleagues who will follow because the president and uh the national chairperson the president of action mashaba who leads our movement came here yesterday and today to literally give us our Maring orders um to literally tell us what it is we are here to do in this Parliament as members of parliament we take that work very very seriously I can tell you that I think all of us um what we are about to present to you here today is making us all very nervous and very um jittery because the task at hand is not a small task it's a huge task it's a mammoth task and it's one that we take with absolute humility and absolute gratitude and absolute commitment M to doing the very best that we can to serve the people of South Africa so I'm as I said previously um I have the pleasure and the true honor to serve as the national spokesperson of our organization as well as the Parliamentary caucus leader um I'm very very honored and I thank the organization for putting that level of U trust in myself to carry out that work um but it's easy to do that when you have capable committed and equally up to the task um colleagues to work with so before joining um this movement called actions I spent a lot of time a lot of time as a professional in corporate Communications in social investment and in active citizenship advocacy I was one of the people who started uh a program called Civics Academy and this was to ensure or help South Africans particularly young South Africans be active in the politics of our country because I remember when I was a student uh in politics I used to have a a political science uh Professor uh Dr T who used to say to us if you don't get politics politics will get you and so the reality is that we all have a responsibility to be part of what is happening and one of the critical things that I believe all of us here must Champion is public participation it is one of the things that is always lacking in terms of having the people of South Africa have their voice in terms of how we legislate and how what we put into public policy and so it is one thing that we all uh as this caucus are going to be championing throughout my life I have been driven by a desire to see a better Society for all people particularly women in general but black women in particular and so this work I take very seriously and it requires all of us including myself to be honest to be humble and to be a servant leader when action essay emerged as a voice of reason and accountability in our politics it was clear to me that this is the platform where real change can indeed be delivered I'm truly truly honored as I said before today to be one of actionist MPS who believe in our parties values of ethical leadership transparency and putting the citizens at the heart of governance in this Parliament I serve on key portfolio Committees of Home Affairs basic education and Small Business Development where I'm dedicated to advocating for reforms that strengthen our border security combat illegal immigration and colleagues I have to stress this we've you know it's easy to speak um and to imagine but once once you are on the ground and you see what is happening we've just conducted a an oversight um of Home Affairs the situation is dire colleagues we are not tracking undocumented foreign Nationals in our country home Affairs has no idea as to who is here or who is not people are coming in and out of home Affairs to ask for documentation they are getting it however they also for those who just come through and nobody knows who they are where they are and all of that the other dire thing that I would like colleagues to note in this regard is the fact that we cannot Deport certain Nationals let me give you an example if somebody in bana commits a crime like murder and they find themselves here in South Africa and the bana government is looking for them our ethos is not to deport them because our constitution does not agree with the death penalty so we effectively can have Nationals of all and I don't mean Botswana just Botswana anywhere because every time we speak about illegal immigration we are accused of being um you know mostly targeting black uh foreign Nationals or foreign Nationals from the African continent in this regard we're speaking about anyone from anywhere in the world wherever it is that they are coming from and this is a very very huge gap in our policy another department that needs you know to be um um that needs to be looked at and which is one that I'll be championing as well is government printing words government printing works is an estate that is so dire that it will follow in the full steps of the post office what is going on at government printing works is an absolute disaster and we need to make sure that we can follow up on what is going on in that entity the other one is the state Information Technology agency the ca these are folks that are responsible for everything digitally that happens at the department of home office and in every Department in every meeting the ca is a problem and people need to look at that and so during this 5year term I'm going to be relentless in uing issues that impact everyday South Africans I always talk about the women Waging War on poverty unemployment and gender based violence in the northern Cape if there's one province that seems to be forgotten it is the northern cape and in this regard colleagues I draw your attention to what is happening in the department of basic education in the northern Cape where gender-based violence against children in particular schoolgoing age girls is you know it's like uh uh pedophiles you know when they when they are found they just get remunerated by being taken to another department or another school this is what is happening in the northern cape and this particular group of women is fighting against that our cus leader has already let you know and I think now I'm going to formally let you know that I am known as the spaza queen and this is because I'm Unapologetic about the fact that some sectors in our society particularly pzz shops and smm must be reserved for South Africans and we are going to be driving this through the campaign that we started earlier this year called #p for locals we are absolutely Unapologetic about that because it's not enough to say Abe what must replace it we want to Champion the fact that South Africans must be capacitated enabled to be able to fill that Gap When U those people are removed from our communities and you've seen the the disaster that is that has happened in n in Soo and so lastly finally colleagues I want to say that there's absolutely absolutely no sense in the fact that our townships must be run over by undocumented foreign Nationals and so my my objective is to leave Parliament with laws and policies that put South Africans first and I'm Unapologetic about that we want to improve our education system we want to defend our borders and we want to safeguard our democracy and so finally I hope my contribution we help pave the way for a truly inclusive and prosperous South Africa and I thank you all for your Indulgence thank you so much the next person who will follow I believe is The Honorable alen Beasley thanks l so just bit of background I'm a chared accountant with a master's degree in development studies I've been in business most of my life and several years ago I co-founded a philanthropic private Equity company which has and continues to do amazing work my main driver for putting my hand up to be a member of parliament was to be a voice for the unemployed the unemployment statistics in our country are horrific but behind those numbers are real lives and real stories the impacts of unemployment on individuals and families are devastating I'm hoping as being an MP with action sa to be a rational constructive uncompromised voice voice that represents the unemployed in Parliament currently I'm a member of the standing committee on finance and alterate member on scopa dtrc and auditor general because of the critical nature of the standing committee on finance and its huge time commitments it is the committee that I have decided to prioritize currently there are two big issues that I'm driving in this committee firstly is the increase of funding to SARS based on discussions had and based on International benchmarks SS is significantly underfunded with government facing huge financial constraints and with SS collecting over 90% of government revenues and with a tax Gap estimate of 300 billion it is bizarre that s does not receive more funding the underfunding of ss is a legacy matter and it must be addressed it's a no-brainer the second issue is to bring government debt to the Forefront of discussions South Africa's spiraling debt and the cost of servicing such debt is severely limiting our country's developmental potential and is leaving a nasty Legacy for future Generations in 10 years debt has grown from 1.4 trillion to just over 5 trillion and our debt servicing cost has gone from 99.7% to 17.4% of government expenditure our interest bill is over a billion a day and as a country we have nothing to show for this debt my concern is that Parliament has put their head in the sand hoping the dead crisis will go away it will not go away it is getting worse and must be at the Forefront of discussions and hard decisions need to be made thank you you see I told you we were nervous um uh who's next doc Dr colle I'm not coming back Dr will come followed by derine James and then after derine my label will close thank you yeah good afternoon I hope there's an interpreter I'm going to speak in like in uh my name is I'm an opthalmologist by training a health activist by choice and a politician by cohesion from the president you know uh when I came to Parliament after a few weeks one of my Reflections was the fact that I never knew that shallowness could run so deep and and and it was frightening and in the following weeks I then found out that shallowness can actually be contes and and and your fear of descending to the bottom with everyone else now I am a member of the portfolio committee on health I'm also an alternate member of the portfolio committee on women Youth and people with disabilities Public Service clashes with heal so I can't do my duties there and one of the frightening issues is the fact that in health we are committed to se preg in South Africa and we keep different PS but having done that we gasl the nation into this roria of nhi which is basically the greatest form of gas lighting nhi is a funding concept and as such in Parliament it would be described as a money Bill but what is conspicuous absent from it is any comments from treasury or from the Minister of Finance about the financing mechanisms and just having come from an oversight visit you see the fact that provincialization doesn't work there's no coordination you can't have a national Minister provincial delivery because it creates a system of no accountability less money reaches the front line for healthare and one of the other major factors that nobody wants to talk about is the fact that we have foreigners over burdening our healthare system and some of the maternity facilities more than 50% of the women giving birth are foreigners where's the funding going to come from when you look at nhi nobody talks about how they are going to be funded in this health care system that takes care of everybody now in the portfolio Committee of women Youth and people with disabilities I have a personal issue to grind in terms of femicide because I lost my daughter the day after the election and what you see there is what you see across government where there's a lot of money being spent on governance structures a huge cabinet commissions administrators but very little money on the ground for programs just like in health we got lots of bureaucracies lots of administrations nine mec's a health Minister all of whom have questionable competencies but there's no money on the ground for drugs lastly I saw a patient where in the community health center the turn around time is 240 minutes this gentleman 73 years old had been sitting on the benches for 9 hours and had not been attended so until we have skin in the game until it's about us it'll never get fixed and what I assure you is the policy of the action say of saying public officials you public hosps will be implemented that's what I will drive for and I'll ensure that the president of this country uses public healthare with other public off Bishops and public servants that's the only thing you're going to fix healthare thank you thank you so much de James de James anti-drug and social activist always fellow South Africans action say leadership me of the media I greet you in the name of servanthood in my maiden speech in Parliament I said that um while I may be new to Parliament I am not new to the challenges faced by many South Africans um hence it's been a 100 days of the voters voice the ordinary voice on the ground finding finally finding expression in Parliament and as I always say based on what I've observed uh allow me to reflect on the three portfolios in which I serve portfolio committee for Correctional uh Corrections Correctional Services can prison be prison again an action essay STS that I continue to drive over the past week we've conducted oversite at several prisons and what I saw was really shocking with foreign Nationals undocumented foreign Nationals taking up space contributing to the overcrowding of almost over 200% that is ridiculous when I I asked why is this the case we were told that we need to consult these criminals first and based on their permission only then can we do Deport them I also want to reflect on um the portfolio committee on police now there's no need for me to highlight the many challenges as South Africans we up we are subjected to these heinous crimes daily my message to the minister and the national commissioner Focus f is on the lack of resources at Community police stations across South Africa it is sad that at my oversight visit in my community where I H from there were only two vehicles servicing that Community I made a few calls and I believe that those Vehicles will be delivered this week so and that is what that's what it's all about the work in Parliament isn't as much working in Parliament it is staying connected to the people on the ground and actually making uh impact on the ground I always say that we have so many shortages and lack of resources at our police stations and those Vehicles don't get exchange the only vehicles that gets replaced regularly are the vehicles of this blo cabinet and of the ministers how sad is that on time and even get replaced with brand new vehicles Social Development no secret where we the only department where people actually get promoted for corruption where people get moved from one Department from provincial to National if they are found guilty we have called I have called for all of those people who has been on leave for more than a year especially in houting to come in account to Parliament as a result of of the of their unethical Behavior we saw that the food bank in hting Imagine the state of this country and a food bank closes down as a result of un unethical officials and we say it is business as usual it's not going to happen I can go carry on with my observations in my in the portfolios that I serve on but I want to say although I can say you know what I remain committed to giving my 100% And I've really really done my best but I cannot say that it ends there until we hear the ordinary South African say you know what we can feel the impact of the work you are doing only then can we say we have work to serve this to serve this country I dedicate these remarks to the four youngsters that were gunned down in ra Park two days ago it shows the state of our police and the state of this country I thank you greetings outstretched to the house at large um as said before I'm Mal I'm the youngest member of this caucus and this parliamentary caucus uh just a brief background I've got a masters in international relations and politics um I have worked in various sectors including uh the Water sector and rent water and also I founded um a a charity where I assist child-headed households and just before this I was the spokesperson um in the NBA province of exsa right before um taking up this responsibility of being in this Parliament see I'm a proud to I'm proud to be here Talk account to the people of South Africa with the work that they've entrusted us um and just it comes at a time where we've just concluded our first oversight uh which was an eye openening experience I mean Beyond this August House and Beyond the debates that take place in the seventh Administration we got to interface and really see um the work that we do that translates into the daily experiences of our people now the Committees that I serve on are the core face of services um on water and sanitation Public Works and infrastructure and and transport and as the youngest person in this caucus I'm honored to be given this responsibility to serve people but in particular young people in actions A's longstanding efforts to address critical infrastructure challenges improve access to clean water and sanitation services and enhance the country's Transport Systems now the DPW which is public works and infrastructure has shared its Vision to make South Africa a construction site and I happily welcome this in my initial in my maiden debate however it has become glaringly clear to me that before any construction can start um in this country we need deep Institution reforms the procurement needs to be reformed it cannot be that we continue to award contract to contractors that only have capital and Financial Muscle but lack capacity to complete the simplest of tasks there needs to be political will to Institute consequence management for contractors who abandoned projects and officials who are found guilty of malfs we need to confront decisively rampant project delays that are costly to the public post as it stands it costs the public 13 billion Rand for these projects that are delayed not Public Works and infrastructure as the country's biggest landlord needs to reclaim hijacked buildings which we believe need to be repurposed for better public services and finally in the spirit of not leaving anyone behind I will continue to Champion the Reformation of the epwp program which affects young people in its current form we believe that it does not provide Sustainable Solutions to the unemployment crisis the ddg of epwp has already expressed interest in working with us together and I'm excited for this opportunity as you know transport is the lifeblood of this economy and when people can move quickly cheaply and safely our economy grows however there is much to be desired just this morning the TRS were delayed by an hour and a half in the mother City causing havoc on our roads and for commuters I will continue my stringent oversight of enti like pra to ensure that they stay on track and finally when I do my Reflections I think back on two years ago in my home Province Ino under acsa when we started driving the issue of the guani water project and just a month ago we returned back to guani uh with the deputy president and um the the minister and this time I returned as an MP and we witnessed the first nine batch um of of villagers receive water reticulation in their homes and by the end of December we're envisaging that 24 villages will have the will be opening their tabs there this kind of work that ensures that we continue to fix the lives of South Africans and Inspire change and I'm hoping that in the seventh Administration I will be able to do that Within These um committees that I serve thank you thank you and uh I I owe my lab an apology you know when you have uh these types of sessions uh you forget because you really want to get what is in your spirit out and so we keep disturbing the mic um we do have other South Africans Beyond this room who are watching us online and so that is why um if you see that she stopped and paused it's because I literally kicked her elbow um with mine and so thank you very much I think it's very clear um that delivery of their colleagues and I hope that the message that they had brought to you here this morning really demonstrates the fervor and the commitment and the determination that we all hold to do this work uh with that said I'm going to now welcome the president of actions Mr Herm mashava um a leader who I think all of us are very proud to be led by the work that you do sir really inspires us and the commitment also inspires us to be as committed as you are I don't think I've seen anyone work as hard as you do and as a result of that we also are inspired to do more than what you do um at your age I'm half your age and so you know the fact that you can still run um you know at the speed that you run means that we all can do it and so with those few words I welcome you to the podium thank you good afternoon South Africans good afternoon members of the media my super six um members of parliament um uh our national chairperson thank you so much for this great opportunity I mean more especially to you the media for obviously making the time to come and ready listen to us remember when uh we as a party um took a decision to deploy this six great South Africans to Parliament uh we committed to get them to account to people of South Africa because we strongly believe as a party that the representation is not a representation of action as a political party actiona it's a vehicle that they are using um to account to South Africans because they're here to serve people of South Africa not to action as a as a political party so thank you so much and the caucus leader arol for really accepting this huge responsibility I mean at the time when I made the commitment that to to the Medan people of South Africa that we will account to them on a quarterly basis at the time I had not really spoken to them but I decided they cannot only account to us as a political party they must account to the voters is the m to the people of South Africa and I'm so profoundly proud for them for having accepted this responsibility and listening to them this morning makes me so proud to be a South African it makes me so proud to be a human being it makes me so profoundly proud for having left my business uh to get into politics because realized after 1994 for 10 years later my country beginning to really taking a wrong direction and 2015 I then took a decision to say look I'm not going to run away from this country under the current constitutional framework let me take advantage of this great opportunity this country has afforded me over almost 40 years close to four years also in in business use my privileged position to really play that small role in in in my life I'm a one person who actually believes that failure is not an option I will only accept failure after having tried that is really my motor in life that is in My DNA and uh listening to to my colleagues this morning I'm really very pred so Al derine and Alan I'm really very proud uh uh just ready listening to you uh being accountable being um prepared to really Face the Nation to say this is uh our responsibility so this is just really the beginning and I think Michael and your team for having developed this kpi I think uh you know I saw it for the first time this morning Michael just gave us an overview and I'm really so proud that we are going to really be measuring this government not on ideological uh criticism because we've taken a decision as a as a political party to Be an Effective constructive opposition because if you look at what has happened to our country and it's currently happening right now uh we have uh high levels of corruption high levels of corruption that makes me ashamed sometimes of what's happening to my country and at the same time we look at uh how South Africans are being polarized along russan lines it actually makes me more determined to really be in politics the job that is punishing punishing really very seriously my personal Liberties um to completely compromise but I think it's something really worth it for future generations and I think if I look at the space um that action a has to play at a national level crucial because we cannot really develop U this country with the levels of corruption we have experienced over the last 30 years at the same time we cannot really um Prosper or develop this nation if we are not going to get South Africans to coexist because if you look at ourselves as a country we can't undo what is um the current status and situation of our country what we need we need a political party that can actually unite us and get us to accept coexistence and that's something that we are Unapologetic about as section um for really playing that uh CR this critic Ro and I think and I believe it's important that I bring up to speed with our participation in municipalities as I've indicated at National level um um as a political party political party four years old that's something that I think you you guys need to really be aware of actually say it's only four years old and I remember after the elections um because we we had too much expectations but reality don't on us we had the six Super um members of parliament just for your information actually a 4 year old party we are represented by 101 public representatives in all three spheres of government we achieved this in 4 years as much as years we were devastated when the results came out but on reflection few weeks down the line we realize my goodness we've got we are now we are only 4 years old but but we represented in all three spheres of government and as you've just really noticed um um the last few weeks with the last latest development yesterday uh in the city of Tani was executive mayor announcing a executive team it's a new political party only four years old when um some people had already written uh uh our death warrant we've really bounced back uh we are now leading um the capital city of this country put together team that we are confident is going to turn that City around the city of swan is very important it's unfortunate what really happened but we had to do everything in our power we have the constitutional right to defend ourselves and that's exactly what we did I'm a very strong believer that when you are faced with a threat and a threat that was really to destroy you what you do you are te first and I remember um one incident um in 1978 after writing my exam visited my family in orando West and my cousin was going to ptain to visit his family and asked me to accompany and one of the nights spent a week in uh in uh in intain in tab when in in the townships or whatever the township it was called I remember actually one uh evening after having some drinks I was tired I wanted to go home and I decided to live on my own it was around about 1 or so in the morning and uh in one of the streets as I was approaching home um I see a group of guys 3 four and uh I wasn't there so one would have loved to and here danger and I had no protection but fortunate enough um where I and how I grew up was to always when you are faced with danger attack first because I realize this guys um uh what they were planning to do was to rob me you know uh and I said no I'm not going to allow this so as I approached them what I did I charged at them first and obviously but that saved my life and it gave me a chance to to go through and this is exactly what happened in son um it came to my attention that um there was a plot to destroy our organization and I decided Herman this is what you did in 1978 a Tech Fest and that's exactly what we did here we are we landed We've Ended up um being um the leader of a coalition government in the city of something that I never pled but it happened and we had to protect ourselves and I'm overly proud of the work that our executive mayor Dr nasip P MOA has done in the last two weeks on her own now you can imagine today she started with a full team of 10 mmc's who she's going to hold accountable some people are think thinking that xsa is going to be controlled by forces outside I can assure you xsa is going to lead those multi party and why we going to succeed is because we've taken a view of um running and operating with humility with honesty and ethical leadership and the commitment to the people of Sali that's exactly why I believe we will really succeed and um are we going to follow the same model in other municipalities give us the chance uh to uh to really look at to see if we can use our influence in the city of Johannesburg Inu because that's where we have the numbers um and uh because of how deserve better and I believe if fnsa does not really engage on this particular matter will be failing not only people of H will be failing people of South Africa so we are going to involve let's put T to bed um and ensure that we deliver services to all the communities um and residents of T and we'll start negotiations to see how a can play icial role in the turn around of city of Johannesburg and because that's where we have the numbers to make an influence and ensure that come 2026 because we've already accepted South Africa has entered the era of coalitions and uh we will work with other parties that are prepared to work with us but work with us with respect humility and we take the arrogance out of um um the kind of structure that we will develop the reason why I think we we we managed to put together this government in the city of T was was our approach to negotiations we went to this negotiations with humility we went to this negotiations to negotiate the best deal for people of T and I strongly believe um that we will deliver and hold our people accountable we are not going to tolerate corruption we are not going to allow anyone to divide the people of Swani um we want uh we are going to really be the vehicle that is going to unite South Africans through our governing uh measures that we're going to be putting in place in the city of Tali so thank you very much uh to everyone whove really participated in this and look forward um to report back to you in 3 months time again uh to take you through what this colleagues are doing in in in Parliament very important institution um to save God and ensure that it delivers of South Africa create a better future for our children and our grandchildren thank you so much than sorry I'm just making sure that when you take take photographs uh you don't post the one where it's and then

send a shout out and a thank you to our parliamentary staff um you know without these guys honestly our capacity will be burnt out I know for sure um all of us would be burned out and so it's really

whom you are posing your questions I'm going to ask that we please don't um send all the questions to Mr mashaba um you can see that there are eight of us at this table and all of us represent action essay and we can all do so diligently and so I will take the first round if there's more I'll take I'll take another one so I'll take you sir followed by yourself uh yourself M at the back and then do you have a question over there no okay over here and I'll take you in that order thank you very much oh yes ma'am I'll take you when when did you put up your hand just before then she was quick on the draw oh was she quick okay so we'll do 1 2 3 four and five six uh so with the hat you'll be the last one six in this round thank you very much thank you Jason fix4 just a question to um Mr Masa um and then a question to um the Parliamentary leader um Mr TR um m m critics um and analysts and all kinds of people have spoken a lot about the drama that you C and over the last week um some have said that um that you were lab do of thec and the eff Alliance and and and and all kinds of unsafely things which we cannot mention here but what is your comment to that because some time ago you've said that action essay needs to identify itself as a party on its own and move away from that stigma of not maybe stigma but maybe that picture of that you were da lighted I remember you spoke quite extensively on that as well so if you could just maybe delve into that and then just a question to Mr trol um you spoke about um the middle ground or maybe you didn't use that word but the middle area or that gray area of being between the progressive caucus and the gnu which is a 71% um um um 71% strong force how will you successfully operate within that space I mean in Parliament it comes down to numbers at the end of the day you would know yourself as a former parliamentarian yourself so just if you could briefly just chat to us about how you how you plan to successfully navigate that space with the resources um and when I say resources I mean the six people that you have in the legislature thank you so much rational Center ralc Mr trolip you spoke about um laying criminal charges to the Min of Justice Just A Clarity on that because I've been looking and looking uh where exactly did you lay which police station and is it you or like please clarify who from the party laid um those criminal charges secondly um you spoke about the President coming here to answer questions I have not seen the questions to the president but um is there any question to him about uh the Justice minister so that you can and follow up because we know that um followup questions depends on the main question that was asked you can't ask a new question on that well as I said I have not seen the questions but maybe if you can please um indicate if there is a question to the president on what uh he plans to do about the minister of um of Justice and thirdly um speaking about people who um say compromised parliamentarians that are saving here uh actually it's a followup from my colleague I mean when you talk about numbers action sa has six seats in Parliament and you need you need majority uh to introduce reforms how are you planning to do uh any changes around that thanks thank you go ahead thank you so much um my name is Denis T from n um I've got a question for the president as well as Mr trb um Mr maaba uh with regards to Tuan the da and BR specifically have stated that what happened in Tuan will be the end of action Esso now you would remember being in chamber last week the humming of the funeral songs and stuff just your comments on that and then um they also made the the statement that Dr MOA is a puppet mayor for the eff and thec now I remember in Her speech Dr MOA said that she would be a mayor for the people of Tuan not any political party not the action sa not the eff not thec now just your comment on that and then the last question with regards to haing um if the opportunity arises to get that mayorip positions in Johannesburg and uru Leni would you take that up and how badly do you want that positions um to maybe take on control of of action and then to Mr troll with regards to minister simani um action laid those charges against uh Minister simani um did you provide any evidence to the South African Police Services um and then I've also spoken to the presidency and they confirmed to me on Friday that the president hasn't taken any decision yet on uh simani and I've just spoken to the Hawks as well who say they are still investigating but no um update to give to the media um why do we see this delay and what is it that action is want is it a resignation is it that she steps aside or or can you just elaborate on that and then the NPA also confirmed last week that they will not prosecute the president or anyone in the Pala Pala matter can we just have action essay's uh uh comment on that matter as well thank you thank you very much um from daily magic um sorry good afternoon s from daily Maverick just a quick follow up on my two colleagues questions given that action essays caucus is only six people practically what are some of the measurable goals that you want to achieve in the next year two years sir um the next question sir in the head oh no this one okay is from the Independent Media Mr you made mention of the minister hand book that it needs to be updated what are the necessary changes you were talking about who would want to see meet in hand thank yesc comprom proposal to address this a few caucuses are L with compromis and just on the STS Andric are you using are these metrics not maybe a little premature um you know to gaug Performance just months into the ad or is the honey ESS over just in conclusion can be by anyone I know how you recile jumping into in the capital and and the how do how do you that expain why positions is not just a local National discour thanks very much we we knew that would happen um when we are here in Parliament that we would be addressing issues uh of 20 many many many many many uh other provinces apart from here we knew that would happen um May I propose may I should I propose an order would you like to let me start mine are easy ones let me start all right so I will have I will have the president I'll have the president answer the questions posed to him followed by the cus leader honorable Ethel trp and then I will also allow the national chairperson to take a b at the last question thank you yeah thank you very much colleagues I think yeah let me deal with the easy ones uh because I think the ones have directed at me without any doubt are quite easy because um um has been called the lab dog of the NC when we used to being called a light um and I remember when I was the executive mayor of the city of Johannesburg I was called an e mayor so I'm not I'm not defined by slogans obviously people already put on us I really operate on the basis of what's actually quite practical uh in in any given situation I think I entered to politics because of the direction my country was was taking freely concerned with it deep levels of corruption creating 54% of our people to live under poverty and one uh living in a constitutional democracy that's why I decided to use my privilege position to participate directly in this brutal work so look we not going to be defined by um other political parties who we are we will operate in good faith and operate uh in the interest of the people of South Africa and uh um uh one thing that we've got to appreciate is that South Africa has entered the era of coalitions whether we like it or not this is the numbers game um it is a numbers game and uh if uh you want to operate outside the Mandate of the voters unfortunately you'll be left uh on the sidelines of of History you obviously respond to what the voters have demanded of you to to do so at the moment in because of the threat to destroy our party as the colleague from n 24 said um C saying um this is going to be the end of action sa I think I think it was the end of Celia's prank that's exactly the end of CIA prink um he thought when this issue started and they're the ones who started this and uh we we needed defend ourselves I gave you an example of what I did in 1978 at 1:00 in the morning when you try and attack me and I realize you going to I take you I take you first and I make sure that I I destroy you and that's basically what we did as SE to protect ourselves we thought at the time that we were in a stable Coalition with the da we had the numbers in in 20 and all of a sudden it comes to attention that wants to end our life wanted to be another a or cope we said no we are not we are actions a and we're going to protect ourselves and that's exactly what we did yes the last few days has been really exciting for for for us as as a party we we are now completely independent the voters out there are aware now that actually say it's actually a totally independent political party it's not aligned to any other party will always act in the interest of the people of South Africa and uh to protect our own political party regarding Johannesburg and definitely we're not really chasing to really be the uh um taking over mhip I think um uh we will really see uh how we can better uh participate in ensure that we can turn around those municipalities as you are aware to years ago to demonstrate our commitment to the stability of our country um two years ago when papazi lost as executive mayor we and US SE and freedom front plus managed to get the PA to work with us to protect the Da Mayor what happened unfortunately um I actually say being prepared we only had three uh mmc's at the time and we were the we the second biggest political party um in this Coalition I don't know if youw the moment actually say is the third biggest the the party in the city of Johannesburg with 44 councelors so we had the numbers with PA and unfortunately da refused to protect which is really quite unfortunate and I find it actually very strange with what the analyst and the cele of the well are saying about cing but colleagues please let's really be um uh let's not have double standards when Johannesburg was collapsing honestly we never experienc the level of um attacks and insults we received when we wanted to defend ourselves in but when we wanted to save the D mayor in Johannesburg dral who I had the privilege to work with the three years I was a mayor complete silence by analyst by the media but s BR must be some kind of a special person uh I think um he was projected to really be the best mayor the world has ever seen But fortunate enough the numbers actually speak for themselves and um Dr MOA MOA will be unveiling this actual status of the city of tan in the coming days so is still settling in in in her office you will see as you guys are aware da did not take over to Johannesburg sorry the city of 20 in 2021 they've been governing the city of 20 since 2016 since 2016 and as a sectiona we put the da in in t we put the da in Johannesburg we put the da in in in I don't know if youve forgotten that the D pulled out of negotiations with us two days before the election of the executive mayor of Johannesburg and and and as a section they say on the day of of those councils we mobilized enough votes to keep ANC out but unfortunately da collapsed all those municipalities I've always said to South Africans in fact I think I put it on social media the other day that I actually invite the scholars in this country to really look at the common denominator with the collapse of uh governments since 2016 I really invite anyone in this scha to do research anyone doing a master's program very important you'll see who's been responsible for the collapse of the the municipalities and um in terms of navigating of positions I think for us as actions a when we take decisions we put people of South Africa first and some of the um the decisions we take uh on a short-term basis people might really think uh we we are unfair or we are F forers we take decisions that will ultimately make sure that we provide services to all the residents but at the same time make sure that we unite South Africans we cannot accept corruption we cannot accept any political party that's going to paralize South Africans along Lance we will do everything possible on a short-term basis you can insult us call call us whatever names we will stand for what we believe long term it's in the best interest of South Africa thank you very much thank you very much I'm going to start with Mr Felix uh about us occupying the Middle Ground that's not a bad word but what we saying is actually that we're a pivot or a FM in Parliament because we now have a a very powerful government block of 71% and on the other side in the opposition we got a brand new political party with no opposition experience the former Democratic Alliance in opposition was a very good opposition but now there's a void there and it's not been properly filled whatever we've seen in the last three and a half months in Parliament is pretty stereotypical Behavior fromto with party and also the eff that hasn't been successful in Parliament so I believe that we're a full Crim and a fullum if I can explain it best is like a seesaw a seesaw only works if there's a fullum in the middle and I believe that we can occupy that space doesn't matter that we're only six people I've already experienced that we have had an impact in Parliament people are starting to talk about our members uh I've had members from the eff approach me and say that lady with the short black hair and the dark Rim glasses is she a member of action they say wow she's good she knows what she's talking about nobody can gainsay the contributions made in portfolio committees and in uh full um sessions of parliament by people like Kos I've heard um people the chairperson of the committee saying wow that guy who who talks about finances and um Treasury and the um SS he really knows what he's talking about he comes and makes contributions so I believe that we can box way above our weight division simply because we are better prepared more professional and more committed to being that full Crim that is so important to make any institution or organization work uh lulama from sabc we did Lay criminal charges uh I'm going to ask my colleague Malo cor to deal with the exact charges because she laid the charges because the charges had to be laid where the um uh the crime took place in lopo Province and she went there with the chairperson of action sa in lopo and she laid the charges so when I'm done I'm going to ask her just to make some comments about that uh there is a question uh on Thursday um in Parliament it's been asked by glennis Breitenbach from the da uh with reference to the president's comments that he made in the National Council of provinces on the 12th of September talking about the report which he requested from the minister so there will be an opportunity to take up all the issues all the correspondents every comment we've made the charges that we've laid the letters to the public protector the letters to the speaker I'll be raising all of those issues and the fact that there's been radio Silence from all the people in that regard in fact my meeting with the public protector was alarming because they showed no appetite whatsoever to proceed with this investigation uh we're going to be watching what the Hawks are going to do regarding their investigation so uh we will certainly use every opportunity to make sure we hold public office bearers especially ministers to account um with regards two uh compromised MPS and can we make a difference with six seats well the one thing that my colleagues will attest to is that I had a previous political life and uh I remember I've been inspired my whole life by people like Helen susman who was the only Member of Parliament in her caucus and she made an incredible difference so we tick six times potentially stronger than that and uh we've already seen that we can make a difference so I have no doubt that the six of us will make a difference and if you use every lever to influence people people by encouraging them to do the right thing and if they don't do the right thing you expose them for their reluctance to do the right thing so we're going to use honey and the stick to get MPS to do the right thing and I believe we can be successful with that um sorry I didn't know it was Bennett or Mr Bennett I just want to say one thing I'm sure Mr mashaba answered the question around s's PR and Chan All That Glitters Is Not Gold in my life and I've seen that so many times but I do know that Dr naipi Moya is nobody's puppet and she's not there alone she has got the support of this caucus she's got the support of every member in this caucus we spoke about it this morning in our caucus committee and last night when we had a meeting with our president she's got the support of every member in our Senate and she has the support of our national leadership so she's not alone but she has already shown in two weeks once as a acting mayor one week and one week as the mayor that she's nobody puppet so people who are calling her a puppet that's premature wait and see uh the and that's for and then um with regards to um Minister semani what evidence evidence do we have well the evidence keeps mounting we had an interaction with the minister where the more questions we asked her the deeper she got recently uh she appeared before the anc's Integrity commission she made some statements there laterally we've heard that she was encouraged to withdraw those statements the statement said that she reported her VBS allegations to the president in 2021 when he appointed her as a deputy Minister well if Minister r i mean president Raposa needs time and space he's known for requiring a lot of time and space 2021 to 2024 is enough time and space to deal with a minister that has a cloud of corruption hanging over her head and we're going to put more and more pressure on him to deal with that um why the delays from the president well you know I can't answer that but he has shown that he has got scant epat for taking action against members of his executive committee what do we expect well we expect at the very least a a resignation or suspension or that she gets fired because why should people in the course of Public Service be expected to go on suspension while investigations are continuing when the Minister of Justice can continue sitting for example in the judicial Services Commission today and the whole of last week appointing judges yet she has a cloud of corruption hanging over her head so she actually should just step aside if the president hasn't the gumption or the corruption the the courage to deal with it she should step aside while the investigation is taking place as for Pala Pala it is not going to be swept under the couch the the NPA might believe that there isn't a primari case we believe there is a primari case for example if you or I were found with $580,000 in our couch we would have to answer in a court of law because that is a criminal offense in itself where the money came from from that's another matter where the money went to that's another matter how did they try and follow that money and get it back that's another matter there are a whole lot of matters but the fact of the matter is that there's a contention of the foreign exchange act in this country and the president must account for it simple as that um daily Maverick um what do we plan to do in the next two years and what are the measurable goals uh that statement that I gave and read out this morning it's available to you I think that we've set out exactly what our goals are in that statement and I have already answered the matter that I think with six people you can move mountains if you want to um and Mr Marina uh how do we propose to make changes to the ministerial handbook well we're going to use every lever available to us including encouraging members of parliament and other political parties to do the right thing we can't continue with a ministerial handbook that allows people to live a lavished and safe lifestyle when the rest of the country lives an impoverished and unsafe lifestyle so we were going to encourage members to do the right thing we're going to do it in public speeches in public statements we're going to call parties out we're going to challenge them and we're going to use every influence that we have and I want to tell you that the sphere of influence is enormous in Parliament every one of us attends committee meetings we don't do that in a vacuum we sit there withc MPS efms mkp MPS dmps we building relations we're starting to get recognition because we're serious about fixing South Africa that is a fundamental slogan it's only slogan that actions has we're not a sloganeering party our slogan is we want to fix South Africa and every day we attend committees and attend plenary sessions in Parliament people are starting to see us for a party and individuals that want to fix South Africa and you can wield incredible influence with that kind of reputation um as for compromised caucuses uh with members who appear now in Parliament with impunity as if they aren't implicated in state capture to me I think that honeymoon is going to be very very shortlived what I found incredibly encouraging last week in the judicial Services Commission was when we were appointing judges to the various divisions across this country all the people that are in the field of justice that it means attorneys Advocates chief justice herself judge presidents they were all saying we need judges with criminal jurist Prudence experience because the state capture cases are coming now isn't that amazing we've been waiting for years decades and and people in the JSC are talking let's get the experience we need to prosecute successfully and put people in jail for State capture so that's what's going to happen people are going to start going to jail even those people who've arrived here uh you know know I made an observation mkp arrived quite to everyone's surprise and I think their own surprise with 14.6% they all arrived for the first 2 and a half months they wore camouflage uniforms all of them backpacks Jack Boots ber you name it and then when they realized after 2 and a half months it's not really different to the other party that wears overalls you need to have a bit more substance in that when the new state capture guys arrived in their jackets and ties all of them start wearing jackets and ties you got to be about more than that as a political party you have got to have integrity and you've got to have the kind of attitude to being a public representative that is credible and trustworthy and they haven't achieved that yet um lastly with regards to the metrics being premature I'm going to ask Michael Bowman to respond to that question because they they they're a living assessment of metrics I'm sure Michael will speak to that uh and then in conclusion before I ask Malo to speak and then Michael in Chan I think it's so exciting in South Africa that we have a different option in the gnu we've got 10 political parties it's pretty much me mirrored in the provincial government of national unity in kzn also pretty much a GNU same parties now in Johannesburg there's a different uh Coalition and there's a different Coalition and there will be more going forward and the people of South Africa will evaluate and measure which one is successful which one isn't successful when you have choices you can make choices when you have no choice it's hopson's choice thanks Apple so as our caucus leader has has just explained uh we went on the 1 of October to go and open a case against the now Justice Minister timban who was then at the time um the the the mayor of Banu um municipality so we decided to open it in bani because that's where we believe that the matter took place um and we instituted these criminal charges against her because we believe she was in contravention of two charges so that's the pra law uh the prevention um of and combating of corrupt activities Act of 2004 and also the common law of forgery because we believe that um the contract that was produced between her and gundo wealth solutions that is postf facto was actually forged in order for her to sort of legitimize this transaction which we believe initially was illegal um they have given us a case um it's c17 sl10 sl202 24 um so we have not produced supporting documents because we were not in in possession of it however they have opened the matter and they have opened an inquiry um to that end the matter has been escalated to the Haws and the Haws have gotten back to us to say that they are indeed investigating the matter thank you you swapping with me all right I'm glad Herman and AOL have dealt with the TR stuff because uh I was going to be less polite about it but I must tell you it's just a side note uh it's interesting that the people who ask these questions will not ask whether or not the da are puppets in the GMU it's different isn't it we should probably explore why it is that we have those kind of thoughts and don't have them respectively because uh the idea that a smaller party is a puppet is not necessarily going to hold and the encouragement I'd offer everyone is to hold people accountable by their performance because that's the only thing that matters if that government delivers it will be praised and that's the only language that South Africans ultimately will care about in the long term let me respond to the question that was posed to me though by by uh on the metrics being premature there's no question what we're trying to do now is to establish a baseline uh you can imagine it's October 2024 I'm glad I got the month right there uh and to think that you will have turned around unemployment or economic growth and and things that operate in 18 to 24 month Cycles is probably unrealistic uh but actually it's about establishing a baseline so that as more and more data comes in and we will be updating this tracker on a quarterly basis or as and when the data is available to us we're going to be looking at Trends and ultimately those Trends are going to become more and more telling as we go into the fiveyear term of office but we must understand what this thing is actually about is about putting numbers and facts to something that has been dominated by emotions because ultimately you know a person who is unemployed and has been so for the last few years is not going to be able to take any of the kind of things this government is offering and eat them or provide electricity for themselves or any of those things uh they're going to need tangible change in their Liv lives and that's why we need to measure uh these particular elements of performance as it relates to your question of conflict between our Municipal and National position uh and this is an important one because what actiona decided and let me address the broader set of questions is that our position that we had prior to the 29 May election is we won't work with this one we won't work with that one put action and say in a hell of a corner because what do you do then when the people you are working with are failing now you must work with with no one in a world of coalitions you must just sit there in the corner and wait for your next next election it can't work that way and I think it's bit of a a maturation we've had to undergo as a political party to say you know we shouldn't actually say at a broad level we won't work with all of these different parties what we should say is that each and every decision about who we will work with and who we won't should be based on the people and the municipality or the geography under question so it might very well be that another municipality arises which we choose a completely different configuration of political parties but it has to be about what's best in the area in question there is no doubt and I think it remains true right now that what's best for the city of China was not the hash brink of collapse which I think was very well demonstrated by the fact that that is a city that is now bankrupt that's not an emotional point of view that's a factual point of view and at the end of the day another configuration was necessary it can be true well that is true it can be equally true that the best role for Action essay is play nationally is a constructive opposition because a scenario where 71% of parliament is in the government is really bad for the idea of transparency and accountability especially when the official opposition party does not appear to have any sense of what it means to be an opposition party I think from that point of view we must base each decision on its merits and that's what you're going to hear from us going forward and I don't think these things speak speak to contradictions I speak to principles that need to be applied to a different set of circumstances that are at play in each particular decision thanks very much um I just want to respond to the issue of being a cus of six um you know I think my my Focus leader has elaborated on that very much but maybe let me capture it by this quote if you think you can't make a difference then you surely have never spent a night with a mosquito um a MOS you know how that goes right can really change uh how your night transpires going forward um and so as the Super Six we are punching above our weight we're doing the very best that we can another example that I'll give is the hhpa for locals campaign all of a suay everyone is talking SPS irrespective of the fact that Mr mashaba was ridiculed when he mentioned the issue of illegal immigrants when he was the mayor of the city of Johannesburg and so we are saying as action say you now have seen that's how the abah campaign came through it came through because people realized that this was an issue there is a pressing issue for the poor people of South Africa who are the ones in the townships who have to contend with these issues if you are sitting in the leafy suburbs of South Africa this issue may not you know uh um hurt you as much as it does with the people who arrive unannounced and have to live among the people who are who are um uh contesting for resources and contesting for space and so we brought that onto the table and nobody can take that away from us that's our track record is action say and so you know um right now the issue of U uh uh Contraband Goods the issue of U poisoned goods and and all of that that are in in in communities you know we started with that Mr Masa started with that we ran with it and that's why we are championing this puzz for locals it is important for us to continue to bring these issues into sharper Focus the issue of um the private members bill with regards to uh particularly flowing from the issue of Dr John we believe that it's actually a great opportunity um for our country to to put this issue on the table to say it actually doesn't follow logically to have the the lawmakers of our nation ourselves members of parliament not pass the fit and proper test and yet the people who must implement or or or adjudicate those very laws their standard must be higher it just logically it doesn't make sense and so what we are saying saying is that um we are going to make sure that this issue uh is brought before parliament in the same way with the with the private members bill I think my colleagues will be working on that and that will definitely uh be in process because we believe that the people who must represent the voices of the people of South Africa must be fit and proper must be with Beyond reproach and must be people who are credible and with with Integrity otherwise this is how we got to this point where we've got RS and rs and RS of the the of the state of capture reports that the president has been given and yet we have not seen and it's good news now that uh that the cus leader has shared with us that people will begin to be going into uh orange overalls we absolutely cannot wait for that I think that I can take um another round of questions if anyone has them otherwise uh we are open to one-on ones if you would like to have them I know that we are all pressed time but I I take your lead on that just one Clarity again from me Mr trp uh on you said you had a meeting with the public protector on uh minister simani in your in your in your statement here it's not clear it doesn't say when was the meeting just those clarities when was it um Matthew will help me on the exact date but let me just take you through the chronology on the 26th of August I wrote to the public protector to say this matter is now broken into the public we request a um private investigation independent investigation she wrote back about 3 days later and made a commitment that she would respond to my correspondence within 10 days she missed that deadline I wrote again to the public protected say you missed the deadline can you please give us an an undertaking of what you're going to do they wrote back uh and requested a meeting uh I agreed to the meeting meting the date was changed uh to 2 days later I thought it was a p personal meeting but turned out to be a zoom meeting and in that Zoom meeting they asked me more questions as if I was the person under investigation and I realized that there was no appetite I then corresponded back to them to say that this matter needs to be investigated because there's new evidence that's come to the FL one of their main issues was why am I raising an issue that's 6 years old when there's a prescription period of 2 years and I said well firstly I'm a brand new member of parliament it's only come to my attention on the 26th of August 2024 now that it's in my attention I want it dealt with uh they also asked me a whole host of uh other questions about why they should investigate it the meeting was on the 19th of September so I wrote on the 26th of August the meeting was on the 19th of September I even told them in that meeting that I detected a reluctance to investigate and if they didn't investigate and didn't respond positively before the the end of that week that I would be laying criminal charges so I did give them notice and there was no appetite I can say that categorically there was no appetite a lot of prevarication backwards and forwards and asking me questions as if I was under investigation anyone else good great that's fantastic we call it a day thank you all very much private private interviews anyone wanting private interviews Matthew here colleague Matthews here uh he'll take the one-on ones if if there's any appetite for it thank you are you still leaving looks like okay so if you if you want to catch the president you'll have to catch him uh differently through his office he has got to catch a flight he actually quite late thank you I can't change my flight at2 so still have to get someone to rush me to the airport but but you've got my contact details here again Zoom whatever e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e

zLtbbTniUd8,Markets Update | 14 October 2024,2024-10-14T11:43:16Z,349,"onto your markets news now Asian markets ended today's session mix this as they digested us producer price inflation data out of the United States as well as an official announcement by Chinese Authorities on the possibility of further fiscal stimulus measures the Nik share average closed up 0.6% the Hang index declined by 0.75% while the Shanghai Composite Index continued on its winning streak gaining 2.07% over in the United States stocks posted positive gains on Friday with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 registering yet further all-time highs this was on the back of strong earnings from Key Banks which was a good start to the third quarter earnings reporting season despite Tech heavyweight Tesla Falling by 88.8% following its Robo taxi event the NASDAQ still managed to end in slightly positive territory the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.97% the S&P 500 gained 6/10 of a percent while the NASDAQ composite index ended the session up a third of a percent a quick look at the local indicators the O share index is up 0.8% at 86,1 50 index points the Rand is trading at 1751 against the US dollar 22 86 Visa V the British pound and 1913 against the Euro gold is trading at $2,659 an ounce while Platinum is trading at $978 a fine ounce while Brent crude oil is trading at $7 7722 a barrel Gary boyon is a portfolio manager at rans Swiss and he joins us to break down the markets for us very good afternoon Gary so the US third quarter earnings have kicked off on a winning streak uh on Friday at least um what does that then mean like in terms of what you can expect the earning season to look like in the United States and how it's going to influence global markets yeah so if you have a look at the US earning season we're only expecting third quarter profits uh to increase by by 4.3% so that's actually one of one of the lowest amounts uh in the last couple of years so we've seen a lot of analysts uh you know reducing their forecast cost a lot of the growth is expected to come from the the more typical AI stocks the likes the Magnificent 7 you're talking Tesla alphabet meta um and the likes Microsoft Etc um and essentially if you look at the the balance of the S&P 500 you're only expecting around 1 1.8% growth in in earnings from them so we are expecting almost a more subdued earning season but uh the first companies to report are usually the banks so on Friday we had JP Morgan we had Wells Fargo and they really do feed into expectations around what potentially can happen in the earning season because they are so intricate to the US economy and and what they reported in their numbers was that they they're not seeing the Slowdown that many people expect you know credit card spending remains High debit carding trans debit card transactions remain high and they were saying that the idea of the soft Landing is looking very very good and and potentially there could be no landing at all so if that is the the case and and we see the the increase in interest rates that we've seen not having a material impact on the US economy that will be very very positive and the expectations around earnings might be too low in that case hopefully we're in for a little bit of a santa rally as as we close the year we wait and see so Chinese investors don't appear to be very happy about the announcement that was made by Chinese authorities about further stimulus what did the Chinese Ministry undertake to actually do I think that's the the question everyone's asking so everyone has been expecting you know a raft of the mless measures to come through and the announcement that we had over the weekend just wasn't heavy it lacked Clarity they wasn't enough detail uh to really explain to markets at a granular level um you know what what measures would be taken I think everyone was hoping for you know certainly like tangible support for the the property Market uh you know specific support around uh the Chinese consumer as well and and it was just absent of details so there was no mention of the the scale of the spending that would be undertaken and I think that really does concern markets um just with with the opaque nature of of the announcement that we've had so far so I think everyone looking for a little bit more clarity a little bit uh a little bit firmer details there were definitely commitments to to increase uh you know the stimulus measures but but just how we we we don't know at this stage well as you always tell us markets don't like uncertainty so interesting to see that the oil price has actually dipped a tad today that's despite climate uh disruptions in the US Gulf uh and also the ongoing tensions in the Middle East absolutely another Market that is plagued by uncertainty at the moment so you at the moment I think that you know we did see you know cyber attacks across Iran specifically to targeting their government fac I have to intervene there we are now Crossing to another story but thank you so much for your time and insights as always"
eImsMbblxxE,Customer Service Week | How digitalisation has impacted the banking sector: Anton de Wet,2024-10-14T11:38:02Z,333,today marks the beginning of customer service week and with a special focus on the banking sector we reflect on how far customer service has come over the years in the sector thanks to digitalization and other Technologies and how the consumer now benefits from 247 banking well to discuss further I'm joined by Anton devet he's Chief client officer at netbank thank you very much for joining us Anon so I was reflecting on my own personal experience of how banking has radically changed over the years years but for many young people their experience will be completely different in interacting with banks just give us a snippet of history in terms of what U you know being a customer of a bank looked like 15 20 years ago yeah interesting thanks very much for the opportunity to talk to you so some of those younger customers may never even know just how dramatically banking has changed so for those of us who do remember issuing a check would have taken some seven days to clear um things like Banks St you'd have to go into the branch and you know request a bank statement and to make a deposit you'd have to go and stand in in in a line and take a form and fill it out so awful lot has changed predominantly on the back of digitization so the expectation now is around clients being able to use their Bank in their pocket indeed so Mobile Banking really bringing that alive so you talk about a Quantum Leap in customer service in the banking sector referring to the kind of digitized service levels that we now take for granted just tell us about some of those Services now that we take for granted and how it's been enabled so an awful lot of work gone into digitization generally and I think one of the biggest challenges we've had as a as a bank is to not just take the existing processes that you would have had paper based and turn those into something available um digitally but to really use that opportunity to streamline those processes and and right at the heart of our design would be to try and make it as simple and intuitive for people to be able to transact with us so some of those services are typically the banking apps all the kind of functionality that exists on banking apps available you know to you on smartphones gives you an enormous amount of of functionality um even digital banking as as if you looked at that progression from physical based kind of checks issued into online banking or web based and then into the app as the most mobile and convenient form um we've seen that transision come through so big amount of investment into the digitization of processes and services and along with that an opportunity to really streamline and make things as easy and intuitive for clients how much of an impact do you think the covid-19 pandemic had on accelerating the use of digital transactions with people realizing you know that there wasn't really a need to go to the branch because they couldn't yeah well heartbreaking to think back to those times you know just how difficult it was to manage under lockdown but what it did do is it did spur on um our ability to be able to digitize much more quickly so for example if we took if we took as an exercise how we would like to have moved staff to be able to work um from from outside of the office and dial in well that would have been a long carefully managed program and all of a sudden with lockdown well that got completely accelerated we had to change our systems processes um and facilitation security especially to be able to allow our our staff to be able to dial in and Bank you know do their banking remotely and of course from a client point of view very many um Services I think were much more easily adopted um out of necessity um and and I think there's no going back you know very many people who have enjoyed the benefit of a digital proposition um we we'll now see um just how how much more more CL friendly that is just how much easy it is to be able to do your your day-to-day Banking and on one last Quick one uh just about it's a conversation that's had right across the board in across many Industries how do you get the balance right between you know a digital efficient service while at the same time ensuring that people are able to speak to somebody over the phone or to go in branch and get service with a person I think we've all experienced those terribly frustrating Loops when you get into some sort of Aid driven chatbot that just doesn't answer your question so that's not the answer you know pure digital unless it actually answers the question and helps the client with what they're trying to achieve is not the answer so we definitely still have room for a warm relationship response and the ability to be able to talk to a person when you need to do that obviously that POS poses lots of challenges on us to be able to organize ourselves operationally but from a client perspective you want to be able to at your convenience do what you want to do digitally and when you're really stuck and you need help as best we can um still provide that help that you can actually speak to somebody who can talk you through what you need to get done Anton thank you so much for speaking to us that was Anton DEET

dqhl6ePrWJQ,Tito Mboweni | 'He was always the first in class and had the courage to ask teachers questions',2024-10-14T10:53:21Z,18369,the words of condolences are continuing to pour in following pouring uh following the passing of former Finance Minister and Reserve Bank Governor Tito boeni boeni died on Saturday evening in Johannesburg in a Johannesburg Hospital following a short illness he was 65 years old bo was South Africa's first minister of Labor from 1994 to 1999 in the cabinet of former president Nelson Mandela he continued to work as the first black governor of The Reserve Bank Bo also served as the Finance Minister in the sixth Administration Sac news reporter KET mut caught up with M's former classmate to reflect on his earlier life uh for more on this we cross to uh goo who is standing by for us in limo it's over to you kto well thank you so much n and good afternoon to the viewers day indeed I'm here with one of the former Minister's classmates me Shala malar who is also a relative to the former Minister dieni and I want to know just reflect in his early life and um I'm welcoming her here Mal thank you so much for joining us here on sabc news let's talk about the early life of you were his last mid just take us through what what kind of a person was precisely because you also started grade one together sub a uh thank you very much I'm shalam Mal I'm cousin we started sub a not grad sub a together in Bodo but commonly known as B primary school that's how uh we usually call it most specially because it was very difficult for us to to spell uh the name so the principal there was um Mr sh SD we from the early age we we started to understand as we we grow and understand all these things that he was a leader he would ask questions then it was taboo to ask a teacher a question if you don't understand you would just go out of the class and just but he had the courage to do so and sometimes when going home because we travel a little bit further after school we ask him why could you do that said no if if I don't understand I have to ask and then after school then we had I don't know what it's called in English we were using slate that thing that we write and erase write and erase we will use that to go and revise what we learned in class H he would be our teacher to teach us what is that and then when we try to re how could you do that no no I didn't understand but I think I understood it so I want to make sure that I understand and then when we went back to class the following day it was easier for us because we had him to teach us and he was always the first in class always the first in class and in whatever he does he would lead us and I just don't know why we couldn't Rebel what he was telling us maybe because mostly we all cousins in that classroom and then we we passed standard six then it was standard six where we had our first certificate he passed with first class distinction if you could have that you'll see distinction in in in in that class in that standard and then we went to Duma High School in Duma were the first group to to start the secondary school not the high school now it's called D high school but then it was a secondary school that is from form one but were form one only but it went from form one to form three and we the first group and our principal was Mr maim so there he also showed more more leadership uh because the the teaching after school continued would go home it was a little bit further than the primary school it will be very late but he will make sure that we meet together English was the most problematic subject to us and the primary school from subba to standard six is s everything it was in s the only thing English in in English it was English itself so to transcend from sh to English in everything it was very difficult because yeah English too much he would say I talk whether you like it or not I'll s it to finish when we go home start the lesson again they have been has been that was it that's what we called him because the has been had been us problem he will teach us and then we go back to school we will perform better than any other person remember I said we're cousins and we're staying in the same area and then um as teenagers I can't say h we're the best and well behaved we will make noise will do things that was not acceptable to the teacher the principal and when the principal come there will be someone checking where is everything the cost is clear when you see him coming will jump to the front stand there trying to take and they will say anything will follow him and then the principal will say why are you making noise all right so I just want us to talk about when he first become you know became the the minister of Labor during Nelson Mandela's era and later on you know becoming the first black governor of The Reserve Bank you know um and later on he became the minister in the president Rosa's cabinet how did you feel particularly when he became the first uh black uh governor of The Reserve Bank okay thank you uh we're very very very excited I can't explain first not being a minister of what or what but being in Parliament were very very excited and then when they announced him as the minister of Labor oh who said is it from this little farm here comes a man who's going to lead the the the laborers and I was very happy and knew he would make it because always you call a sp sp what he doesn't want will tell you he doesn't want and that then because it was very hectic in the labor department it did very well but the most most exciting thing that we enjoyed as his classmates former classmates and his cousins was when he became governor and you know what excited us is to see the notes the man signed by him and that someone came with the NES I was working somewhere and then just came to say come then he just gave me the notes and then why are you giving me the notes just look at it oh to say that my cousin signed it my former classman signed it were very and I kept it for very long I tried after I had his passing on I tried to look for it I can't find it but I know I find I said this I will keep that is that was very very important and very exciting to us and very encouraging to the community where he's coming from well thank you so much may Malana that is the one of the classmates of the former Minister and reflecting on some of the you know exciting moments uh with him but for now because of time let's get back to you in studio so nice to hear the memories from somebody who was with him in his early

Jg9YRh7_tTg,"Gauteng Education | MEC to give update on matric exam readiness, Grades 1 and 8 online admissions",2024-10-14T09:09:17Z,580,give you other news worth your attention now it's just a matter of days before the final metric exams begin and of course government across the country are readying themselves for this particular setting let's get you a sense of what the situation is looking like specifically in beinging our reporter B who's watching those developments and in balen we're expecting some kind of media briefing what can you tell us it's that time of the year where the the country um really prepares for the metric exams and we it's no different here in the province of King where the Mec uh will be announcing or announcing plans as to you know the state of residance for the exam period now you will also understand that there are grade 1 and grade six parents who are grade eight parents rather who are still waiting to be placed and we do understand that the department has vowed that they will not rest until all children who applied through the online system have also been have all been placed I'm joined by Steve maona who is the spokesperson uh for the uh provincial education department thank you so much for taking the time to speak to us um it's a very scary time for matriculant right now as they prepare for the metric exams and I I imagine that the uh MEC will be trying to you know send them a message of encouragement so that they are not as anxious um as they probably we think that they are yes definitely I mean it's 7 days to go um as you as it were all of them they've been studying and we've been uh preparing you know our Learners and uh it's up to them now and I interacted with a few because we're in a school here to say it's up to you I mean you are out of our system but um MC will be giving us a detail on how we have planned for this process how ready we are you know giving us more details so that's what we'll be doing and as again we just to encourage them like as you said that this is their time and also encourage parents to give them time you know we don't need to send them you know give them extra chores and all those things so we just need to manage and also psychologically they should be mentally you know ready you know to sit for this examination okay now some of the challenges that have often come up during this time of the year is the issue of paper leaks you know and also accusations of you know um you know I don't know teachers trying to assist their class and you know just going through a really nefarious means to try and up the numbers in terms of the metric pass rate um any contingency measures in regards to that no we have planned for that I mean security wise we have planned uh you know you you will see a detail you know on the presentation on how we Safeguard our papers whether in the storage where we store them and in transit when we take them to different uh distribution points uh up until they land in a school and in a school as well there's processes just make sure that they are safeguarded so we not going to be missing when coming to security you know the leak you know comp romise the Integrity of the examination so we will not allow that to happen in the province and we should be in a position to guide on in the event of anything what is it that the Learners need to do or the candidates rather because uh if you are found to be not honest you might uh lose an opportunity to write for the next three examinations so it's quite um important that as a candidate you are here to the code of conduct I mean on the 18th we will be signing a pledge all Learners will be signing to say this is what we're going to be doing to adhere to the code of conduct of uh the examination okay certainly now while this is happening we do understand that the online application process is still ongoing and while there have been placements you know there are those who are still waiting to be placed and others have possibly rejected the schools that they might have been allocated um what's the way forward I mean some if a parent says I want an English medium school and they are allocated to an African medium school what happens there look uh parents would have applied to a school that they would have been offered but if it's a mistake that you would have committed to apply to an African single medium we should be in a position to look at that case but if you apply we cannot say it's a mistake because remember it's not only those that are you know Africans speaking at home that will opt for the for the Africans some you know Africans colard they will opt for the Africans single medium for the reasons that they would know and they have many of them so we will then look at it very closely if it's a mistake but we know that the parents that their status says um you know prog application inog progress uh we are continuing with that process to to place we will place up until we placed everyone so parents need to look out uh more so that we going to be starting with the process of transfers uh but then if we transfer to you you to a school that you didn't apply to and you don't want it then you will be in a position to object or even you know appeal to the to the MC but how far along is the process I mean in terms of percentages how many students have have been you know placed so far and how many you're waiting no I can't do that MC will give us that information uh later with a presentation that we have prepared so statistics is ready MC will then do that for us no problem so I am preempting the process I do understand thank you so much uh for your time uh there you have it Steve maon is speaking to us ahead of that much anticipated briefing on the Readiness or state of Readiness for the metric exams and also on the progress of the online application process for grade 1 and grade 8 Learners it is now back to you in Studio B is live to us there from Edenville in Johannesburg thanks very much indeed

questions actually The Minister's presentation focused primarily on escom spectors that have helped improve the prognosis for the power system did did any non escom factors play a role one of the national treasury expectations for allowing escom to to begin raising new debt for projects is that tariffs moves to cost reflective levels however the minister has said such move will be untenable how can escom be given the go ahead for its new strategy in light of these new contradictory positions okay there are more on the other chart Tak I'll start one from helmore PR from IND ENT media he says please give me a breakdown of which countries received how much gwatt hours export in August for example Zimbabwe received 456 gwatt hours of the 823 Gatt hours we imported how much was wheed to mosal he explained that mosal is an Alum aluminium smelter in Muto in Moos he went on to say electricity is wied from K basa via Apollo to to mosal then there's another question from helmo has there been any fed slipage in the return of service of the long-term outage units such as M unit form he also had has another question what progress has been made on updating the IRP can I POS will continue please continue okay there's a set of questions from um Ibrahim from news 24 um during this 2011 days without low cheering has escom experienced any critical power stations being shut down for repairs like kuc unit one with these has escom relied heavily on ocgs to ensure that loow shading does not return second question from them does escom believe that it currently has sufficient sufficient reserves to allow for unpl shut down and repair of key units in escom Split thir question could you expand on the escom 2.0 which would be launch launched including the 2,000 megaw of clean renewable energy that the power utility aims to launch the fourth question is the minister confident that the days without load sharing can extend to the summer months then there's um a question from Alex winning from Reuters in escom media statement over the weekend marking days without low cheating the company mentioned that it wanted to launch 2,000 megawatt of clean energy projects as part of a push for a sustainable energy culture Energy Future sorry could you elaborate on that does that mean escom wants to operate more of its own wind power plants and add its own solar plants over what time over what uh time frame and how could you fund that will that be outside of the re I pr program what sort of project delivery method could be used would escom take on all the risk itself or work with private Partners that's all on the chat for now Tak uh thank you very much Opry will now get responses um I think we'll start with um Mr Malo who will be followed by um the GCE and then the minister will sum up uh the responses thanks thank you very much S I think the question for me is is to deal with the issues of U units on the long-term outages I think since the summer plan discussions we did indicate that the units on the long-term approach was uh M4 and kuc unit 2 so so those units are still has P those plans at Quebec end of the year and then it before end of the financial year so which is end of mar so we still working very hard to bring those unit uh in line with those commitment that we have made to into the country obviously with commissioning we might pick up some issues but our teams in both these plans are working very hard to to ensure that we we we come back uh in those times and it also suffice to say that we are currently now already entered the the summer period there was a question that talks about summer we are in the summer we have started our main maintenance program as well here at Leo is one of the stations so there's quite a number of units that are already going into the maintenance period so we continue to do that then there was a question Minister that was talking I think it came from news 24 about the Reliant on ocg the point we normally make is that this ocg is part of the running the system that include everything it include all the Renewables everything get taken into account when we run the system that's why it's for where I'm sitting there's not one we need to have enough reserves on ocds because they've got a role to also cover when uh the the issue for us is when they are running more and then because of the cost issue but the minister indicated that if you look at it year on year we are about 11 to 12 billion now we on the reduction on the ocg UT so so that is really the key message and this year we are about 5.5 billion uh less than the budget which was already reduced for the year as well so so that is quite critical then the last Point uh Minister talks to also escom but maybe then can also come to say Minister talked through the example of Lial with matima so those are the opportunities that we are seeing within escom to say how do we deal with the the current opportunities in terms of the funding approach I think we've been uh out there National pressure is supporting that we can do the private partnership with escom to deal with this issue of how do we fund those opportunities so so those are the things that we really looking forward uh the board has directed us that we need to really start Expediting those processes to make sure that we move forward thanks so the context for a strategy in as far as a uh Renewables energy within the clean energy portfolio is really one the technologies that um escom will still have a critical role to play in the electricity Supply going forward and that there's a need to do a step change in terms of embracing uh other Technologies as we get to the uh towards the end of life of some of the stations we have said this that um we postponed the U shutting down of some of our stations as was initially planned to enable us to shore up energy Supply security of Supply but also to enable us to do an orderly transition an orderly transition that recognizes that uh we exist within an ecosystem that gets negatively impacted by the discontinuation of operations and so what we need to do is to really bleed in um new technologies alongside our existing operations on our land um on the back of the capacity that we have of our people and close a great connectivity and we indicated that over the next uh 2 to 3 years we see a pipeline of just over 2 GW of opportunities here at this place where we are at um we're going through the evaluation stages of the commercial proposals for the 75 megaw PV plant here at leabo we've identified uh Renewables in the form of PV and wind for some of the stations the stations within um the panga areas we're going through the details of the funding approach and as Becky says this is an approach that we have now embraced that we will do it on us on our own or with others so we're going through those motions of how we partner um and bring this to life because uh escom itself will grow this its uh capacity uh from a clean technology perspective we already have a wind farm we had the first big wind farm in the country that we are running in s we're going to expand on it we've got pump Hydro um you know that is operational we uh and we have Ambitions to continue to expand that capacity uh elsewhere in in tuat area so that aspect is uh something that we'll come back and brief you in detail at the later stage I think that's uh that's that's really the issue Minister the um there was a question asked regarding how much have we been exporting to our neighbor countries we are constantly um having flow of electricity in and out of out of our system it really depends on um how the system looks but one key point that everybody knows is that Zambia has been going through some uh tough drought situation and there's been a call to get support and to the extent that the system allows us we've been responsive in that area the moves back and forth towards mosal this is uh mosal is a uh old existing customer of ours um and and again you know it's really an issue of how much we have and how much they need and uh what opportunities do we have to use them in the entire system we can provide those numbers but this is nothing unusual it's a it's business as usual in as far as the flow of electricity to those countries is concerned oh okay no thank you very much maybe just thanks to to Becky and and Dan for for the respones maybe for the ones that are left and essentially directed to me the C power ship is dead in the water I think a statement was released sometime last year or so to say that it it hasn't met the deadline so something that is buried is is behind us and then maybe to Terren question so it's a delicate balancing act so the on the one hand the board of escom in the management the board has got a fiary responsibility to protect the interest of escom ensure that escom continues to be a going concern and also meet the conditions that are set to by to them by national treasury as part of the fiscal support and escom in their own calculation they are able to compute and and and reason out if you like to nura which is a body that is responsible for finally making the determination on what is going to be the applicable tariff then escom makes a submission make the submission independent of the minister because Dr TI and the team have got that obligation and we don't interfere with that process and and build into that is escoms um um intention to ensure that they don't rely on the fiscal going into the future so essentially is a strategy to free itself from from National Treasury and continue to execute its mandate um as a responsible and efficient provider of electricity in the in the country so escom makes that submission then on the one on the other hand the president unveils the three Apex priority areas of the seventh Administration what are those the first one is inclusive growth and job creation the second one is to fight poverty and reduce the cost of living the third one is to build a c ethical capable and developmental state so let's focus on the second one on the reduction of the cost of living so it's a stated government policy to ensure that we are able to reduce the cost of living just a general appreciation that households and businesses um uh are experiencing if you like significant economic headwind so we've got an obligation to protect in the main uh if you like lowincome households and the poor and we also know that electricity is a big part of of that equation or if you like of of the cost of living what the Tariff does is a transparent mechanism of supporting an entity like Esco so that's what the Tariff dispensation does and it gets to be socialized with the public everyone that wants to make a comment is free to make a comment and that'sa takes that into an account account rather and then makes a determination and then there are nontransparent and policy instruments that we can use to ensure that escom still achieves its ambition with without necessarily drawing from the Tariff approval but there could be other support that is given to esom and that's where the policy maker comes in without interrupting or interfering rather with the nursa process so the point is that is not a binary conversations or as you put it those are not contradictory positions those are two separate um interventions that can be made so that the chair is confident that whatever decision gets to be made escom is still able to operate and it's able to show that it's meeting its treasury obligations to the extent that um some of these interventions that we are proposing internally and that's a conversation we're having internally has got fiscal implications that's the space of the Minister of Finance all that I can do is to make the submission but it's not for me to pronounce on Tax Matters and all of that is the Minister of Finance so that there's no confusion on where that responsibility lies but internally I can raise that and that's an issue we are raising and I'm more than confident like I said to the public we will protect the interest of escom what the board wants to achieve also protect the poor and we'll also make sure that the lights are on and the South African economy is able to recover so we'll we'll be able to uh to do that going forward and then uh on the question of the escom 2.0 is my own reference I'm sure the the board will come and explain what the point I'm making is that as Mr the group CEO is that escom wants to enter all right so those are live visuals from L Power Station speaking there is the electricity Minister Dr hosena marking 200 plus one days is what they terming it but certainly a m Stone given just how long it's taken for the country to get to a point where it feels like we can safely r on escom to keep the lights going um without any kind of unplanned Interruption and really what they've been doing there is uh getting us a sense of how they've managed to get here in fact there was a question also posed about whether escom is now at a point where they're able to support other countries and it seems that there is a steady flow both in and outside of the country um as those transmission lines are maintained in fact Zambia was one of the countries that was cited that's apparently receiving some kind of support but Denmar the CEO of escom saying this is nothing out of the ordinary um in case it's such grabbing headlines I imagine we'll continue listening in to that of course for you get you a sense of what else is being said but it's just gone 10:00 this is the agenda"
PaCJSt1B2_g,Durban Raid | 'There is no place in KZN for criminals and undocumented foreigners': Thami Ntuli,2024-10-14T08:49:31Z,35240,but let's take you to guazu Nadal now because a police raid is currently underway in the Durban CBD it's apparently focused on unlicensed foreign Nationals watching those developments is sabc news reporter senu Maka who joins us now live from the Durban CBD and S it's an all too familiar site I imagine but I wonder to what extent police they feel like they're actually making progress it is indeed ay an all too familiar site we are today at the Deon CBD where a multi operation disciplinary operation is currently underway uh earlier on uh I did indicate that police have made quite a number of arrest but of course uh there is no official word uh at this very moment from officials in terms of the numbers but the premier of guazu natal that's Mr tamy duli has arrived at this particular location where we are he has just been briefed about this part of the operation and he's going to be talking to us more about that but what I can certainly tell you ayanda before we engage the premier is the fact that where we are this is a crime ridden spot in the dean CBD where a number of criminal activities take place here uh earlier on of course we saw the arrest that were conducted a number of those are who are arrested currently uh basically homeless people and in them rather we do still have you know undocumented mented illegal foreigners according to you know what the other official that we spoke to said earlier on off camera but we do have as I indicated that we do have the premier of gu Nat that is Mr who has arrived here H to get a sense of really the operation that has been conducted who's going to give us the figures in terms of how many of these alleged criminals have been arrested but let's welcome first the premier of course would not tell Mr coming through thank you so much Premier for your time talk to us about this operation today well thank you very much the the operation is a very important one which uh is conducted by uh different sectors of government but in at the center are the police uh the saps of Wun natal and also the metrop police ofin Metro uh the purpose in fact was one uh to with crime uh and even people here were building were mushrooming uh the shelters illegally where in a lot of illegal activities are taking place the issue of the drugs uh exchange taking place and even as some of the undocumented foreign Nationals they were finding their home here uh today the police have been able in fact to H find discover a 15 undocumented foreign National in in one of the in one of the buildings here and here you could see that people who were here more than 200 in a very space small space uh who have built their shelters using the Plastics the black Plastics and different materials uh which is quite very unfortunate for the city H to have such a bad image which will discourage in fact even the tourists and the investors I think an operation which is ongoing which you are going to see going on because we are saying Inu natal there is no place one for criminals there is no place for undocumented foreign Nationals every criminal and every undocumented foreign National must must know that this province it does not belong to them they must leave W natal or they must rather stop doing crime and they must go back to their countries and look for the documents as so that they would be here officially like all others who are here officially in fact it's a a campaign against a crime andal speaking about that particular campaign Premier last month we saw a similar operation where at least 120 illegal or undocumented foreign Nationals were arrested what is the process in terms of that particular operation have they been deported and what is the status with regards to that well they were deported back except for those who had discovered to have committed crime they still held up in the cells so that they answer for their actions that is in fact the process that they have gone through not only those that were actually discovered here also in pet Mar more undented foreign Nationals were also discovered as part of them they were deported back to their countries and others with criminal cases then they still going through the process of answering to their behavior what do you say to critics who say that the guazu natal government is basically targeting foreign Nationals in in the province well our operation is not in fact solely targeting the foreign naal however we are saying we cannot Overlook also that one because that is another element which is making the pro of natal not to be what the people of natal want to see but at the same time our operations we also visit shops to ensure that they sell food which has not expired like we have seen cases of children dying because of the food that they buy in Sp shops in fact even the ordinary criminals like the other operation that we we we made here we the police were able to arrest someone who ran away after raping someone in one of the townships here that person was not a foreign National we are not targeting foreign Nationals we were targeting crime as natal were saying we are hard in crime as we have heard that in the actually assassinations that have recently taken place people are being arrested and people who try to sh shoot at the police the police are able to react successfully I think natal despite the fact that we still have high level of crime but the work that is done by the police and other departments who are that are cooperating with the police is quite really commendable I know that this particular operation is still underway Premier but at the moment are you aware of the number of those that have been arrested as we speak well 15 uh undocumented foreign Nationals were were discovered in one of the buildings well we're able there are those who are not even well who are staying here who have to be attended to by the department of health because all departments are here DSD is here home Affairs is here U and um you know Health Department is here there there are many departments who are here so that whenever there is work for a specific Department the department will take over in that area what happens to those that are homeless Premier that have been arrested as we speak because if my memory Sayes me well we've seen a number of these operations where you arrest homeless people but a few days down the line you see them loitering around the streets of of of Dev what happens after they've been arrested the plan was that for those who will cooperate they will be taken to the shelter but for those who decided to run away nothing could be done it means they will continue creating problems but our operations will continue you know that H we're approaching the the festive season and you want to assure the people of South Africa and even outside South Africa that Deen were cleaning Deen they must come for the December holidays and spend time here in the in the province of guazu natal because we are all working together to ensure that we render this Prov to them safe especially atwi which we know that it attracts millions of people during December we're encouraging people to come into our Province we'll be here with the police we'll be all over ensuring that they are safe when they visit thank you so much for your time no thank you very much that's the premier of gu natal Mr who has just given us an update ayanda in terms of the today's operation with regards to clamping down on all illegal activities I'm going to ask my colleagues W to walk with me as I try and really explain the uh report that has been given by the premier here ay basically saying that um they are aware that a number of illegal activities do take place around the city of deban but their intention is to clamp down on all illegal activities uh that may be you know happening around the city of De and as I'm trying to walk with my colleague is aand I'm trying to get to where those arrests were affected earlier on where we saw a number of homeless people some of them unfortunately are not well ayanda they have been referred to uh health workers here who are going to be taking over in terms of providing them uh with the assistance uh that they require but this particular area where we are AA we normally see a number of criminal activities taking place and as a result the city of gin has just taken a decision to deploy its me members of uh the Metro Police to really be on the lookout for a number of these uh you know suspects who normally conduct uh crimes such as Smash and grabs and basically uh theft and hijacking in this particular uh part of the city but of course the premier there as stating that the police are working tirelessly with the various stakeholders to try really and clam down on all illegal activities in the city of Dean in particular and of course this operation has been uh ongoing ayanda and uh with regards to that particular uh operation which was conducted last month the Premia saying that those who were arrested who were found to be in the country illegally have been deported but of course you do also get those who were wanted for a number of crimes you know getting themselves you know involved here and the premier saying there that those ones are undergoing uh Court processes uh those who have been charged as you can see a in your visuals a number of police have been deployed across the city of Dean uh to really try and work on this problem uh that many residents have been complaining about the issue of you know uh homeless people who sometimes uh find themselves on the wrong side of the law you know and of course you do get uh those particular incidents or cases of undocumented uh foreign Nationals happening as well ay sure um one can't also help but notice in Period the absolute decay of the part of the city where you're at now I mean some areas literally looking like dump sides and I suppose these things all happen at the same time you know if criminality takes over um in some ways a lawlessness prevails and literally the place goes into ruins indeed I it's quite a problematic issue here uh in the province of guazu natal as you heard the premier there stressing the importance of working with various law enforcement agencies to try really and uh claim down on illegal activities happening in the city of Dean and then of course as we approach at the festive season the premier saying that they are concerned about these illegal activities happening because some of them unfortunately end up you know affecting uh even the tourism industry in the province of guazu natal where you find people saying that perhaps guazu natal is not such a safe place for me to come which of course affect the economy of the province of guazo natal but of course this particular operation is an going operation last month a similar one was H held as I indicated earlier on and of course the premier did indicate that more such operations will be conducted particularly across the city of Dean to try and really you know win this fight against illegal activities iand all right s Maka thanks very much indeed it's a story we'll certainly keep watching with you as it continues to unfold but for now let's leave it there s Maka reporting live to us there from the Durban CB d
7o0lVAOzXOw,"[GRAPHIC] Orange Farm Shooting | 'If I was here, I would have come between the bullet and my child'",2024-10-14T08:44:44Z,19966,let take you back to one of our top stories eight people including a three-year-old child being gunned down in orange farm that's in the south of Johannesburg three other people were wounded in yesterday's incident which took place at Mong informal settlement another suspect died in hospital where um he was taken in after he um Turned the gun onto himself after apparently carrying out that shooting sabc news reporter Calvin Jula as part of our team monitoring developments and he joins us now live from the community and Calvin I imagine a lot of grief and sh where you're at good morning to you ayanda and to our sabc viewers at home yes it did it's sadness grief and shock in this family a dark cloud just hang over this family yesterday you would remember yesterday late we were here when we had that such a tragic incident took place we spoke H to the family memb who explained and elaborated the O deal to sabc news and we also spoke to a community member who complained uh about the number of tavns and the shortage of police officers H in this area when we left yesterday I under interviewer at home we were told by the family members that the toddler that was in hospital in the Intensive Care Unit um was not well and the situation was bad but today the update that you are getting from family members is that there is an improvement in hospital you would remember that we reported that there was someone who's living with disability that was involved in in this shooting and he died so let me introduce the mother who just came yesterday after we left and you can see h i under as I'm moving to her um for next it was for um iand as you can see the situation is very bad here it's t things are getting worse this mother is struggling to come to terms and struggling to hold tears I what happened to the child something that she will take time on not even forget mom after Sunday morning Sunday morning it's worse m I we have to warn our sensitive viewers at home for this live coverage that it might upset or disturb sensitive viewers that would be fore fore I'm sh May right for everywhere every for for okay better for for you know as reporters we cover different stories we cover different angles we meet different people we interact with different people for different stories but you know when you it's time to cover such events you end up with no words you you you don't even know what to say thousand words cannot Comfort this family there is no word that you can say to such family members that can Comfort them you end up being Mom you you end up keeping quiet you end up destroyed yourself but as you know as reporters we need H to Sol your own we were here aanda H yesterday late H to cover the story when it broke we spoke to family members they explained the oral to us and as you know we played the package earlier and we are here H to get an update there's a a family member a mother who came late yesterday her child was also shot dead in that H tragic incident she's telling ASC news struggling ayanda to hold tears she is saying that she does not believe that she has lost a child she says it will take her a very long time if it happens that she forgets about the old deal we spoke to one of the family members she's blaming herself ay she is saying she should have done something better to protect those who passed on the last person that I spoke to she says government officials are nowhere to be found we broke the story yesterday and the story was live and I would think some government officials even if they are watching now they need to try and do something about this issue we will try by all means aand to talk to official especially the Social Development to come and assist and see what can be done to assist this family when we came in remember when remember that ayanda there was someone who is not a family member but a neighbor who was here when the incident happened and we saw we passed there with my video journalist and there are church members there I believe they are there to comfort them Unfortunately they didn't allow us to come in because they say they need a privacy so that they can have time to grief there are police officials here local police officials are here in this area there are members of the community outside maybe in our next Crossing we will have to engage some community members especially I those who were there yesterday when we spoke to the community leader he told sabc news that yes the crime is r in this area but for such an incident tragic incident seven people shot dead is not something that is usual I think we have to give this family time to grief and deal with other issues they gave us time yesterday to speak to the them under same situations conditions and they also giving us space in this house to also talk to them so I think we need to give them space for now the latest update I under is that the child that is in hospital at Toler the situation is improving for now let me say back to you in studio a right Calvin certainly a difficult story to tell as we wrap our heads around the extent of the loss that's being felt there for now thanks very much indeed Calvin is live from Orange Farm in Johannesburg
mDKKx0sUYBc,"Health Matters | Differences between flu, colds and allergies: Dr Michael Mol",2024-10-14T08:22:40Z,695,welcome back now it's easy to think of the flu as a winteron visitor but the truth is that it obviously lurs around all year long and even a mild case of the sniffles can actually make it difficult to navigate the demands of everyday life now it's virtually impossible to avoid germs all together but you can in fact make sure that you're ready to fight off an infection whether it's a minor cold or full-blown case of the flu and it's important to understand the difference between the flu allergies and of course the common cold so let's help clear up the myths and also get better at spotting what is actually going on when we start feeling a little under the weather no matter the season so uh joining us now to talk about this is no stranger to television I'm sure so many of you will be so happy to see him Dr Michael mul good morning and welcome to morning live an absolute pleasure to be on morning live thank you for having me it's our pleasure so here we are in the middle of a heat wave and some people are actually struggling with flu symptoms but let's just start by uh taking a look at the key differences uh how can we differentiate between uh these three conditions uh when we talk about uh common cold flu and allergies and I'm so glad you asked that because it's such a good question most people say to me oh I got the flu and I'm like do you really have the flu because it's very different to what you might be experiencing so uh you mentioned the three allergies colds and flu so allergies typically flare up immediately after you've been exposed to an allergen like mold or dust and typically you get a tickle in your throat watery eyes and continuous sneezing the difference with allergy flareups is that you won't have a fever and your symptoms will disappear once you removed yourself from the allergen so uh or I mean if something you've got if you're loading to something like dust then symptoms can last Almost indefinitely so not great for allergy sufferers when it comes to dust or mold colds on the other hand uh are highly contagious and caused by viruses passed from person to person and symptoms usually come on gradually and include a a stuff for your runny nose sore throat and sneezing and coughs are are hacking and productive but it's unusual to have uh fever chills or headaches and body aches with a cold but you can generally expect if little bit Miz for about 10 days and then it wraps up and then the flu uh not to be confused with the man flu because we obviously don't have enough time to get into that but the flu virus is the nastiest virus of all and it is far more severe than the common cold I mean symptoms come on rapidly like 3 to 6 hours feels like a bus has hit you and they're most often accompanied by a fever so your cffs are often dry and unproductive and you're likely to experience chills and headaches and moderate to severe body AES and tightness that can last up to three weeks so allergies just while you have the allergy colds 10 days flu up to 3 weeks and it's really important to know which of these three are giving you a headache so that you know when you have a legit legitimate reason for staying under the covers and I would say maybe just to wrap up that question is as a general rule people with a cold are most contagious about 3 days after their initial exposure to the virus uh for adults with a flu though that contagious period lasts around 5 to 7 days into your illness hey and if you got kids they usually last about two weeks so it it's quite a mix so so should you be concerned if those symptoms um and you're feeling um ill continues beyond that stipulated period does that call for cause for alarm well maybe let let me tackle on a a subject that answers that question people often will feel like my cold has lasted 5 to 6 to 7even days it's time for an antibiotic okay please um can I just say this you know is there do you ever need to use antibiotics for a cold and the answer is absolutely not I don't know how to say it in how many languages n No never they only treat bacterial infections they do not treat viruses so they've got no effect against viral infections and no effect against the cold or the flu and obviously not against allergies the thing about um mucus often people say to me my mucus has turned yellow I need an antibiotic no here's how it works your your viral respiratory infections are characterized by clear thin mucus from your nose or the back of your throat for the first phase of the illness and then infection fighting cells move into the area to fight off that infection and those cells secrete proteins that change the color of your mucus causing that clear mucus to turn those lovely shades of green and yellow and I'm am I making you nois I'm make myself nauseous and but that's the normal sequence of events and taking an antibiotic will have no effect against that or change that process in fact the World Health Organization says that antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing public health concerns and when bacteria are repeatedly exposed to antibiotics they toughen up they get resistance which means when you actually do you need that antibiotic to treat that bacteria it's ineffective would last a whole lot longer and here's a message to parents especially is you need to be the bigger person here literally uh Studies have shown that when a doctor uh when a doctor feels that parents expect antibiotics they prescribe it 60% of the times and when they don't feel that parents expect antibiotics they only prescribe it 7% of times and that's private and public so please no antibiotics that that's that's quite telling um we are out of time but I quickly have to ask you Dr Maul so anything that we can do to reduce the number of tissues that we use in other words prevent getting you know a flu or the cold all together I'd say they four s's that's probably the simplest way to uh to avoid catching a cold or the flu so soap always wash your hands and wash your hands with soap washing with water is completely ineffective and make sure you dry them after you wash them so first s is soap second is sleep my favorite thing sleep is an immune booster 7 hours minimum and you're going to pump up that immune system third s is superfoods so these are foods that contain zinc and vitamin C and selenium all which boost your immune system so we're talking things like berries or spinach uh Brazil nuts um and and then just a balanced diet throughout the winter months especially and the final s sweat exercise guys most people say I'm sick I can't exercise no moderate intensity exercise actually boosts your immunity and it gets you out of bed next to your partner who's come down with the flu so definitely for s's so soap sweat superfoods and sleep and you'll avoid flu any time of the year Dr Michael Mo always a pleasure speaking to you and I can tell you my phone is flaring up people so happy to see you so thanks so much uh for gracing us with your presence this morning Dr Michael Mo joining us

especially in and around uini with these raids of late talk to us about what's anticipated today please indeed this a we are at the Deon CBD as we speak to you uh behind me you can see a number of uh basically people that have been you know captured as a result of this particular multidisciplinary operation which involves the South African National Police Services as well as the dean Metro Police uh basically the operation as akina is known as operation cleanup the police have been visiting various you know cities I mean rather buildings across the city trying really to conduct particular raids which have been happening rather for for quite a while now you recall that last month a similar raid was carried out in the uh Dean CBD as well Point Road to be precise where over 120 suspects were arrested that illegal foreigners Sakina they were arrested in that particular operation but this morning uh police are continuing uh with this particular operation uh but what we are told as Sakina is that it's not just the foreign uh illegal foreign Nationals that are being targeted uh on this particular operation but it's also the you know people who may have been who may be suspected of doing any illegal crime particularly in the province of was what is happening now is that police are busy screening those who have been arrested and once that it has been found that they have been involved in some crime criminal activity and then they will be taken to the relevant authorities uh for them to be processed at the moment we don't know how many of them have been arrested but what we are told by authorities here is that the operation is currently ongoing and underway and police are basically still uh looking around basically the city of Debon trying to really get their hands on those suspects that they are busy looking for earlier on Sakina we saw the quaz natal police spokesperson that's Kel Robert n I'm trying to scan through and see if we can uh perhaps sport him from here but of course we are expecting that the premier of guazu natal that's Premier T is going to come here obviously as part of this particular operation just to get a sense of what is happening and give us uh really you know the stats in terms of how many people have been arrested and the charges that they may uh be facing as a result of the particular arrest but what we have been told is the fact that when that particular raid took place last month the 120 illegal foreigners that were arrested were really you know taken through the processes of trying really to deport them to their respective countries H for on my left Sakina I can see the police spol person here in guazu Natal that's Kel Robert nund I'm going to try and get a word from him in terms of uh uh this particular operation that is currently underway here this particular area Sakina is really crime Reading area if you are familiar with the uh city of Dean you would know that even underneath this bridge there are quite a number of criminal activities let me try and get a word from the police spokesperson here in guul Natal who's trying to run away from me but I'm going to try and convince him we are live sir on sabc news chel talk to us about this rate not as yet we don't have enough info to communicate as yet but once we have details we communicate thank you so much well Sakina there you have it there that's kenel Robert I was just trying to get a word from him but he says later on during the day obviously police will have much more information to communicate with members of the media in terms of the operation that is currently Happening Here the premier of quu natala indicated earlier on Saka has been on record saying that they are going to be clamping down on all illegal activities across the province really H this of of course is one of those efforts in trying to address the issue of crime in the uh city of Dean and we are expecting that obviously uh during the course of the week similar rates are going to be conducted across the city of Dean in particular you know that is black by the issue of homelessness uh which in some cases result in criminal activities Sakina uh thank you so much simp and perhaps imp when you do speak to um Mr Nunda later on perhaps you could put that question to him about those who were arrested previously and how many of them were actually deported uh just you know to get that on the record perhaps uh because we see these raids we see people being arrested but what does it ultimately lead to so perhaps just a question there uh that we can get an answer to from you later on when we crossed during uh one of the shows on sabc news and that of course our reporters Ina makanya and the Durban CBD and this is of course uh where another raid is being conducted by law enforcement officials South African Police Service long with the um uh Metro Police in the city conducting this latest raid
u4kF4Sqtbog,JSC Interviews | Seven candidates have applied for Judge President in WC,2024-10-14T06:54:53Z,3059,well now lead story this hour the Judicial Service commission's interviews continue today seven candidates applying for the position of Judge president of the Western Cape Let's cross now to our reporter in santon Kenny manga Kenny of course these interviews to F various positions uh started last week today we're looking at the Western Cape and uh talk to us about some of the candidates that will be interviewed today well good morning to Sakina and to the viewers at home well we are rounding up the October leg of the JC interviews and this is going to be possibly quite a significant day because these interviews zoom into the Western Cape division of the high court judge president you may remember Dr John lope following uh his subsequent suspension was removed from office by majority vote in the National Assembly of course um when he was removed there was an acting judge in that position but today will finally get a final appointment to the judge president of the Western Cape high court I think the significant interview that everybody will be looking at this morning is the first interview that is lined up that is Judge Patricia Goliath you may remember she serves as the deputy judge president of that Division and has been acting as judge president in the term that will end this month so of course it's very important for them to fill this position and it explains um the reservations regarding the October leg uh of the interviews and Dr John Lopez uh participation because essentially today we are looking at a number of candidates uh that could serve as his successor if successful in these JSC interviews and this body does recommend a candidate of course judge Patricia Goliath is quite a senior judge nearly two decades in the Judiciary that is the first interview that will be coming up today of course she submitted that there are at least like 15 judgments that have been taken on appeal and of those eight were upheld and five were overturned so quite an impressive uh resume from Judge Patricia GTH then we look at the general Council of the bar the comments that they've made on Judge Goliath they've said this candidate's appointment would send the message that candidates with demonstrated leadership skills and administrative ability are sought for appointments as judge president so she's almost received an endorsement from the general Council of the bar so we expect that that will be an interesting interview to look at I'm not sure whether the J will look at some of the tensions in the Western Cape division in the past as well as the counter complaints counter allegations that judge Goliath and former judge or impeach judge Dr John clopp made against each other when they were working as judge president and Deputy judge president in the division and the kind of instability that caused in the Western Cape Division I don't know if that part will be considered in her interview this morning but teina it's going to be quite an interesting interview as they are starting with the front runner who has been the uh acting judge president in this division during that uh unstable period where Dr John clopp was suspended and then subsequently removed from office but today by the end of the day we hope that uh we'll have an answer as to who will lead that Division and hopefully hopefully rather bring stability to the Western Cape division of the high court well Kenny thanks so much and of course uh looking forward to your updates throughout the day for
MYSH5S8s4Z8,"Tito Mboweni | ""He drove SA's economic transformation"" : Lesetja Kganyago",2024-10-14T06:49:33Z,5048,and welcome back now the late Tito moeni has been praised for his role in shaping South Africa's labor legislation and also driving South Africa's post- apartate economic transformation he was appointed as the first Democratic minister of Labor in 1994 a position that he held until he became the first black governor of the South African Reserve Bank between 1999 and 2009 now during his tenure as Minister of Finance between 2018 and 2021 one buen had also to deal with many challenges including South Africa's slow economic growth fighting corruption and the economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic so to talk to us about Tito moen's Legacy we are joined virtually Now by current governor of the South African Reserve Bank lyo Mr kanyo thanks for your time welcome to morning live good morning mrak as the first black South African Reserve Bank Governor how instrumental was Tito boeni in shaping the central bank's future and also maintaining Financial stability at a very difficult time I think stto contribution goes uh Way Beyond him being the governor of The Reserve Bank he shaped the post apartate Economic Policy before he even joined he joined a government he was instrumental in setting out the economic policy of a post apartate uh government including by the way championing the independence of the Central Bank even before The Constitution was uh was written and Tito had a beautiful policy brain and that beautiful policy brain could be fail across various aspects of Economic Policy from labor to trade and Industry to finance to Central to Central thinking and his departure would leave a very big vacuum in terms of Economic Policy discourse in South Africa So you you're so right about you know his role overall that he played um in this South African dispensation and shaping uh what we have today and out of the public I he held many roles and was respected by the global economic community and but what would you say were some of his achievements that shaped this Legacy within the sector well uh firstly was that um a helped position a post apartate South Africa amongst financiers and um investors uh globally and secondly was that he would be one of those people who understood that you are recognized globally because you are successful at home and so when in 2000 which was literally a year after he assumed a role as Governor South Africa introduced an inflation targeting uh framework that um actually provided an anchor for for monetary for monetary policy by 2001 Tito negotiated with came with a proposal which was accepted by Trevor Manuel to put together structures between the treasury and The Reserve Bank so that the coordination of the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy could actually be entr Tred and we put together they put together this mou where the staff of The Reserve Bank and of the treasury would interact with each other from macroeconomic policy to financial sector policy to international relations and so forth and till this day thatou is still what is guiding the interaction between the national Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank put simply he had entrenched an Institutional framework that outlift the individuals that were there being himself and and Trevor Manuel long after they had left the institutions are continuing to function adequately and if we look at his role in uh basically working to maintain confidence in uh South Africa's Financial system uh we reminded also of that 2007 2008 Global financial crisis talk to us about his leadership in navigating that very volatile period and also making sure that uh our financial systems and our banks for example uh managed to survive this pretty much unscathed well it's that contribution is very important but I think that what is is being missed is D's ability to build institutions but not just build institutions make sure that the institutions are staffed by people with adequate levels of training and he spent a lot of time making sure that people study and are trained in economics and up to the time of his passing he was sitting on the board of the Asia School of um of business which is focused on training future Central Bank Central Bankers so he he he he had the passion for the institutions but also a passion to train people to assume significant roles in these institutions and and and one can never underestimate the importance of that especially when we look at a state and you know very often we hear for example at Municipal level about uh professionalizing uh and you know capacitating the state at that level that brings into stockk Focus I suppose the sort of vision That Tito boeni had for the South African Reserve Bank and the financial sector for the state overall well it is it is of course a significant signic contribution you know he in a way also helped to demystify Central Banking you know the programs that Tito introduced from monetary policy forums to the announcements of the Central Bank being transparent public open press conference became a very important contribution it was something that was not done um before he assumed the role of a of a governor and as it stands even today we still have those monetary policy forums in various in all of our provinces and we have now complemented it with a monetary policy schools um a challenge so Tito understood that for policy to become effective people need to understand what is at stake importantly understand that in policy making there are three offs you have got to make trade offs we've got to disabuse the public of a notion that says that you can have enough of everything there are tough choices to be made and he understood that he had such a beautiful policy brain that helped guide this Economic Policy discourse this is so true and one remembers you know how he would deliver uh those speeches in order to try and make us understand those difficult tradeoffs that needed to be made but also you know just go back to that Legacy in terms of um what he affected um exchange control liberalization uh as an example overseeing the gradual relaxation of um exchange controls that made it easier for South Africans to invest abroad as well so again very important sort of work that was done that perhaps the public wasn't too focused on uh Governor Kano no very important important work but I mean also the fact that when he became the Minister of Finance he became the Minister of Finance at a very difficult time the economy was hardly growing and then we got hit by the covid pandemic and still he understood even during those periods that there are difficult tradeoffs to be made and he made those difficult decisions even at the cost that he would be attacked by his own um comrades for taking those difficult decisions but he understood decisions must be made difficult as they are the worst position to be in is indecision and then as you rightly point out um sometimes led to strain relationships between himself and others in government because Tito was just that guy he he stood fast in what he believed and you know um basically nailed his colors to the MK he he fiercely defended the Saabs Independence as well and and and there's a lot that has gone on around that particular matter over the years uh so you know let's talk about that and and and he's defense of this Independence because we've seen over the years uh uh people calling for uh perhaps uh the nationalization of the South African Reserve Bank what was Tito Moen his view per se on that particular matter well um two things firstly was That Tito believed in Central Bank Independence long before he became a governor of The Reserve Bank he was part of the transitional executive committee that inserted the Clause that guaranteed the independence of the Central Bank into uh into the Constitution and it was a very important a very important contribution but he also lived the belief in Central Bank Independence he championed uh Central Bank Independence and when you talk to uh his peers globally they would talk about how a fierce Defender St defender of Central Bank Independence that uh that he was and that uh importantly is that when once you are in an institution led by Tito you must also know that he will steer the institution but not just steer the institution he would shield and protect you from um a call it enemies of what you are actually standing for and when he became the Finance Minister he said to me a governor number 10 and I didn't even call him Minister I just called him number eight so I said to him number eight you are here now I am th stepping away from this debate and he said leave the politics to us we will deal with we will deal with this and so he carried the burden on behalf of the Central Bank importantly on the issue of nationalization he penned a very short piece that has spelled out the history of how the Central Bank ended up with the private shareholders and and why it would serve no purpose to try and nationalize the central bank because this is now a creature of the of the Constitution so he didn't just verbalize things he also had a very good pen and he translated a lot of his ideas to paper indeed and um speaking of you know his uh tenure as a minister of finance appointed uh to that portfolio in 2018 at a time when uh the Reserve Bank was under attack um and you know its independence uh was threatened I'm curious about the sort of conversations that you and him had you know uh dealing with this matter especially as it pertains to corruption in the public sector well I mean he was a stun activist against against corruption but for me the conversation with of the time to do with broad policy and the interaction of different policy levers and so when we said that um he is responsible for fiscal policy we are responsible for monetary policy and we said but that is not where growth was going to come from there are constraints to growth and how do you uh remove those constraints to growth and that is where he conceptualized the idea of operation V which he then said we have got to bring in the presidency in here and you know again didto believed in evidence so even when the Tre said that this is going to be operation these are the things that must be done he said can you quantify can you quantify what the impact of this would be and and that is the he you don't just come with a policy that you just pull out of the head he would like to know where is the evidence where is the data to substantiate the policy proposal that is being good what are the policy tradeoffs what are the alternatives on the table and how do we know that the one that we are going with is the best under the circumstances such a beautiful policy brain that is going to be solely missed in the South African policy discourse indeed and you know um Governor kanyo as you say that um it it it just reminds one of you know how they say uh when people uh start to degenerate to call each other names is because they have no substantial argument to present and when I think about it I I don't remember Tito boeni ever descending into that sort of uh Arena where he needed to resort to calling people names because of what you just explained there to us so just as a final closing thought what's going to be your lasting memory of dto boeni well uh for me Tito was more than a a a colleague um he he was a dear friend and um to the extent that his kids would call me Uncle my children still refer to him as Uncle D I don't remember my children ever calling him Governor or Minister for them he was just he was just Uncle he will be so deiss Governor kany thank you so much for your time governor of the South African Reserve Bank lyo talking to us about the Legacy that has been left by the late former sa governor and former Minister of Finance deeni who passed away this past Saturday

lnCBZELAo5U,Possible teacher retrenchments in Western Cape under the spotlight,2024-10-13T21:59:36Z,2077,recent national day of action by KATU teachers union satu which participated in the march in the Western Cape want of possible legal action to prevent The Cutting of teachers posts in the province so so we will keep on fighting for those po if we need to to approach the court to get the court involved in this country we will do that we are currently busy with uh with it so so that's our next step and of course uh the last resort is to go out for a strike against in Parliament some lawmakers say the job Cuts in education would pose a threat to the larner teacher ratio which is already too high my position is that that's very dire I was raised by a teacher my mother taught at Morris isacson High School you have seen so many children cramped up in one classroom there is no one individual teacher that can handle a 75 90 kids in one classroom in fact they are even bulging out of the classroom because the classroom can't take it now what we're basically saying is that our educational standards low as they are we are at the threat of them going even lower because there is no human being a teacher who can look after children who most of them as you know the percentages for our children in this country who are able to read for meaning at the age of four five and gr r and in the first years of their learning is very poor and it's very low which means they need individual attention even with the best intentions a teacher who has that number of kids in one classroom is not able to is not able to deal with them and also it also means that we can't get teachers who can substitute with South Africa said to have the largest national executive in the world Bosa says reducing the size of the cabinet could help by redirecting the expenditure toward its basic education I think that if you want to make your country unable to perform in the long run cut on education our view is that we've prioritized cabinet expenditure we've now got the largest cabinet uh that in Democratic history we've also given departments money for support staff whereas it's not proportionate to their budgets and ultimately when you look at the census data in terms of each provinces you are discovering that provinces like the Western Cape Ken and Ken are experiencing more and more citizens coming into those provinces yet the budget isn't keeping up so what we've got to do is cut cut the cabinet cut wasteful expenditure stop departments that are returning money and ensure that you focus that expenditure on education if we don't skill our people we kill our people we make sure that they're economically not viable and ultimately they end up lingering in poverty May man says those who will be the most affected by by the teachers job cards are poor Public Schools so I'm challenging the minister and certainly the provincial MCS to say let's allocate expenditure towards education so we don't lose teachers we don't lose scholar uh Transport Systems we don't lose feeding schemes we can stabilize the future of our country at a baseline making sure children are fed transported and have got teachers in classes for the people will feel it the most are not going to be the wealthy or quinal 1 or quintal 5 schools it's going to be the poor schools because their classroom numbers proportional to teachers is simply going to increase you'll end up with a teacher teaching 1 to 100 students which means the quality of that education is wasted we caught up with some people in the streets of Cape Town for their views on the debate across South Africa they shouldn't be cutting in teachers they should increase teachers it will be very difficult for teachers to manage classes because um in public schools you'd find that um in classes there are more than 46 Learners per class and you can't really manage a class of that it's not beneficial for the children because it also impacts the children on their learning and their growth at the end of the day and to that it leads also to an economy that also just becomes worse and poor and poor in towards the education system and there will also be no growth for the children and the entire country itself so I think that it's never going to work for one teacher to obvious viously learn 200 children because it's going to be chaos very much chaos so I think that maybe they should try to they should try to obviously open jobs up for every teacher but maybe lessen the children in the class I think it's terrible the classes already overcrowded so how is one teacher going to cope with over 60 Learners in the class I think it's pathetic and education is the most important thing and they're not thinking about future as departments and entities are expected to present their annual reports and financial statements for the 2023 2024 Financial year starting this week the debate on The Cutting of teachers posts is expected to continue the ministry of basic education is expected to come under scrutiny when it gets its opportunity to present its annual report before the Parliamentary committee mer cedes

free man I've never had a scandal of him even if you follow him on Twitter he was like like cooking and his his shoes yeah I think he always had a an educated um researched position on whatever issues

someone who so like despite all the work he's done he's also been really fun on Twitter with all his recipes um and I think he added a very personal touch with that you know we don't often get to interact with our ministers and with like the political space but he brought a fun element to it and when he told me this morning I was like ah the recipes we're going to miss all of that I follow him I'm a big admirer so I follow him on social media he always posts his culinary uh experiences with us so um I was really SED by his death it it came as a shock I really admire that gentleman he was a

and a lot of that to understand he even made it to one of the hip-hop songs You Remember
weD92LexF5k,Discussion | Mpumelelo Zikalala shares insights on Public transport accountability,2024-10-13T21:16:22Z,426,for more on this story we're now joined by legal expert buo zalala and he joins us now via our video link bu thank you so much for your time I mean very concerning accident that we saw yesterday uh in quaz Natal and one would say that it immediately raises a lot of issues and of course right now what isn't being discussed is the issue around you know who should be held liable when it comes to an accident of this nature particularly the fact that it is a public transport definitely good evening to you and also good evening to your viewers I think it calls a PO for the legislation to be changed because you can feel from what especially the MC was saying to say that there is harsher sentences that needs to be there but unfortunately we do not have the legal framework that will allow us to have it if you say you're charging a person for murder one of the elements that needs to be proved is the element of intention and it then makes the whole m a charge which is placed against them something which is deemed to Fai cable homicide is much better because in that way you say that you don't you didn't have the intention to to kill this part particular individual however due to a negligent behavior and V like liability can then be extended to the owner to say you as the owner have got a responsibility to register this vehicle make sure that it is maintained in a proper manner The Driver's Responsibility is to drive it in a manner in which it's supposed to be driven in South African roads if there something that happens and someone gets hurt within the particular that particular process you and the driver must be both arrested so that we are able to send a very strong message to owners of public transport vehicles to say make sure that your vehicles are in order and bu currently what are the laws when it comes to the ownership of you know a public transport of this nature and particularly uh when it comes to the drivers as well maybe let's start with the owners it's more specifically looking at what what is required in order for you to own that particular vehicle is able to operate in a public by public Arena meaning that you can f public individuals but it is less concentrated on the punishment which is then given to you if your vehicle becomes or is in an accident then the liability shifts to the driver of the vehicle to say when you are being taught how to drive you were given Specific Instructions as to what things need to be there that 10-point check that you do before you enter the vehicle the checking off the tires whether whether everything is working in order is one of the responsibilities which are then given to the tri that means if there's an accident that takes place then the intention the attention moves to the driver rather than the owner which something I think needs to change when it comes to the manner in which we are dealing with things so that we are able to curb these accidents from taking place so that we place responsibility on both the driver and and also on on on the on the vehicle own so that at the end of the day if there's an accident punish them both so that there'll be a much better attention to say how do we make sure that we're able to protect uh the people that we refer on a daily basis then attention must also go to the associations which are responsible when people are boarding these these public transport vehicles to say as a rank manager do not let a vehicle go out if the 10p point check system is not taken place if those prerequisites of saying do you have a PDP as a driver have have not been checked so that you're able to protect the very same customers that you are serving on a daily basis so it's a responsibility that does not only go to the driver not only does it go to the to to the owner a number of other individuals and stakeholders must also come on board what further role can associations play I mean you are mentioning that you know they can check the vehicle before it leaves maybe you know uh a taxi rank uh or maybe a bus station but what further role can they play in ensuring that you know these vehicles are safe for passengers well it's the setting of The Rules before you can even be part of the business of fing public of being in a public space to say as part of your relance or the conditions which are going to be there these are the type of standards in which we then require from you as the owner this is a type of standard that we require from you as as as the driver and also continuous skills training which is going to be there to say well there's always things which are are happening in our roads let's make sure that you are up to date and you are you well trained on a regular basis as a driver and also as a owner you're informed what is required so that you able to meet with the conditions or the tough road condition that you are faced concentration of those could then be focused for example during festive season or during the weekend or during long weekends because that's when you see a number of people of the roads users are going to increase when people people are going home for for various reasons so if you in then increase the concentration on that one then you can be able to fight or reduce the number of evidence that we accidents that we have along our roads if you purely concentrate on certain things can this also applied perhaps to the Ealing Services uh that we see because they are also public transport it it it must be done and when you talk about Ealing Services that's the deficit of our legislation not moving forward fast enough in order to take care of it for example there's only a special dispensation that has taken place when it comes to inhaling Services there's no specific legislation that takes care of which is why you would find them once in a while complaining and saying that we are not being for there's no legislation that cers for such it's just a special dispensation that has been put in place to make sure that up until proper legislation has been constituted or prated by our our parliamentarians then they can be able to to be catered For but it then moves back to say the number one individual that should be protected in these cases is us as members of the public and by the way we are the providers of the business if there are no members of the public the business is not there so it's up to the the the owners of either Ealing and also public transport to say how do we make sure that we protect our customers let's make our our customers kings and queens and make sure that we protect their safety at all times by putting these measures which are going to be voluntary we're going to self-regulate ourselves because at the end of the day we do not need government in order to save lives but it's us as as as the users and us as the owners of the public transport business that need to make sure that it is able to continue for a long time and let's go back to the accident itself uh buo and one would say that you know uh were told that they had no permit uh they also had a certificate of unroad worthiness uh it seems as if you know some of the boxes were ticked uh but at the same time you know it was quite clear that that vehicle did not look like it was roadworthy does this also speak to problems around corruption in the system definitely if You' look at who authorizes SEC of road withness I think they should be even be checked themselves to say do you even know what you're doing when you check for such Vehicles what do you look at is there element of bribery that you face or any elements of corruption if that's the case then a very important and available lesson must be taught to say this is why we punish individuals this is why the certificates are important this is why they should be done in a proper manner because if you don't do them in that manner and you simply accept a few hundred Rand in order for them to pass their lives which are going to be lost and let us look at the amount of of children that don't have parents and other relatives that are now left without their love so it's important that we at thorough investigation in this case it mustn't only end with what caus accident and punishing of the driver and the owner must extend to even the person that issued that road weather certificates in order to teach them a lesson and all the others that are in that position to say if you engage in such a thing this is the type of punishment which is going to follow you but most importantly you are playing with people's lives all right bua thank you so much for your time always a pleasure talking to you here on the late edition that ISO zalala he is a legal expert just talking to us there about uh you know the rules of the road when it comes to the issues around unroadworthy vehicles and at the same time who should be held liable uh for such accidents particularly when it comes to public transport of course also they're highlighting the issue around some of the accidents that took place over the weekend uh almost 20 people losing their lives between quaz natal as well as in the Eastern Cape for

eLAN0MgSKQY,DWYD I Policy dialogue on data for Gender Equality: Adv Mikateko Joyce Maluleke,2024-10-13T20:50:00Z,236,"earlier this week Deputy minister in the presidency for women Youth and persons with disabilities maasa Steve L led a policy Dialogue on data for gender equality which included delegations from the United Nations women the European Union and statistics of Africa the dialogue aims to highlight continued challenges in the formulation implementation and evaluation of evidence-based policies and interventions that should be used to address inequalities if effectively for more on this we're now joined by the department of director General Advocate Miko Joyce Malu and she joins us now via our video link Advocate thank you so much for your time this evening here on sabc news I mean let's start off here one would ask how is data used in formulating policies which are aimed at addressing inequality thank you very much for having me on your show and good evening to the listeners h data is important and it's critical because it helps you to be able to understand the trends but to know the extent of the challenge and to be able to allocate resources appropriately for example if you know that in a certain place there are so many people who have disabilities so many women Youth and and other people you are able to plan and respond to to their needs or to Service delivery as they required appropriately and Advocate what would you say are some of the problems which are unique to South Africa when it comes to the collection of such data um I think the biggest challenge is that a policy that addresses a a collection of data in some instances Lees out important things let me just make an example um South Africa is known for for for for um you know mutilating or taking skins or killing H persons with albinism and the United Nations had to send a task force to come and investigate we had to write a report to the UN and one of the things that they inquired of was how many persons um with albanism in South Africa we couldn't get that data so it's not just I'm just making an example but also data that we have is not disaggregated so you'll get a number that says we have provided services to 2,000 people 2,000 people doesn't tell you how many women how many persons with disabilities or how many young persons in order for us to be able to respond to the issues we need to know um in the service delivery plan how many women are targeted how many men how many young persons how many persons with disabilities or other factors for example people can be disaggregated by being in the rural area access to education is affected by places where young persons have to cross the river unlike in townships where they'll just walk to the school so you need to know how many children are on the other side of the river and when it comes to you know this policy dialogue that was held you know what can South Africa actually learn uh from other parts of the world when when it comes to implementing you know the evidence-based uh policies I think in in in other countries like your us Europe uh Canada and other countries even here in in in Africa there countries which have regulated data collection which in South Africa is not regulated you have a St sa which is regulated but many people and many institutions collecting we need to standardize a collection of information like in other countries whether it's Civil Society or or anyone else but in other countries they use technology to be able to collect data and real time data but also data that is disaggregated the the equipment will make sure that the information that you put disaggregates the information and how important is uh equal gender representation uh in the government structures when it comes to developing uh such policies let me make an example um in the Judiciary we we we we we started seeing representation of women H later and now yes we have the the chief justice but there was a time where all the heads of courts were mes and the Chief Justice was male so there are meetings of heads of Courts find that it's all ma will you believe that um the Judiciary didn't have a maternity policy for a long time until now lately it's because it's men who sit and decided which policy is important it's important to have equal representation so that other groups can be able to bring their experiences and their needs on the table when policies being developed Advocate what other benefits can also be derived from the effective implementation of evidencebased policies um budget allocation it's it's critical because you'll find that budget is allocated in areas where it's not really needed but because um Whoever has managed to motivate for a bigger budget it shouldn't be because somebody is motivated but it should be informed by a statistics by dat data H but also it helps us to be able to understand the needs of Education Health if you're going to provide a service let's say in Alexander you need to know how many people are in Alexander in order for you to be able to appropriately provide services but also you need to know what affects people in a certain area if many people are affected by TB you are able to be to respond if people have got psychological challenges you're able to respond you'll never believe me that in some of the clinics

wT3bD0MSI9o,Eskom celebrates 200 consecutive days of no load shedding: Chris Yelland reflects on the milestone,2024-10-13T20:33:17Z,2105,welcome back escom marks the Milestone of 200 days of load shedding suspension today the Paris State attributes this achievement to the effective implementation of the generation operational recovery plan escom says the consistent power suppli is expected to result in a 2% growth in GDP for South Africa having set the target of reaching a 70% energy availability Factor by March 2025 escom says it remains focused on achieving financial and operational sustainability by implementing ongoing structural improvements to enhance the reliability of its generation Fleet for more on this and to reflect on the 200 days uh without any load  we're now joined by energy expert Chris yand and he joins us now via our video link Chris thank you so much for your time this evening uh here in sabc news I mean lots to celebrate today uh with many South Africans of course expressing so much joy when it comes to having you know no loting uh for the past 200 days yes of course being back to normal is actually a pleasure it really makes us thankful uh for what we have and remind us uh that we don't always have uh this power we have not had it uh you know in the past and now that we have it we really are very very grateful but we should take this as back to normal yeah and Chris you know talking about you know what has been done right I mean Lots being attributed to the fact that the implementation of the generation operational recovery plan has been on track what do you attribute this exactly to particularly when you look at the plan itself well there are many things to attribute it to and and I would start off with president president R president ramapa uh you know he identified that we had a crisis um he did something about it look it took a bit of time uh but he came up with a plan a credible plan after Consulting widely I also give him credit for appointing the new minister of energy and electricity um when that happened uh I for one was a little critical saying you know what is a new person a new layer of of of administration going to to achieve uh but I was wrong uh the minister has shown that he can u pull this off H and he really did not do it alone uh he put together uh then the so-called uh you know National energy crisis committee Nom uh comprising a number of uh players stakeholders government stakeholders who brought in uh you know a whole team of people including from the private sector number of work streams the job was divided up uh and people gave it their full attention so for that I give the president credit I give the minister of electricity and Energy Credit uh but of course of course uh you know all the people of Nom played an important role including business in the private sector uh and then not to forget esim itself um they had the generation recovery plan uh they put in a lot of effort um they were given more money by national treasury to do additional maintenance and that was very helpful um and and enabled esum to to really plan this properly put in the necessary spares people contractors uh and so you know a whole lot of people came together one kind of just say that this is a one man achievement or one person achievement shall I say and um and and yes we were helped also by the weak economy the fact that demand hasn't been very high the fact that esam's price increases made Alternative Energy a viable proposition all of these things came together and and uh you know resulted in where we are today and of course uh when we talk about the availability of electricity we always told about Diesel and much it's costing the country maybe if you can just paint a picture for us how much has it cost of Africans to actually keep the lights on well you know at its worst which was last year uh we spent or esum spent something like 30 billion Rands on diesel H and that wiped out the profit that they would have made otherwise uh and um now that uh load Shing has been brought under control the need to to run these expensive open cycle gas turbines have significantly reduced and esom say they've saved about 12 billion Rand so far this financial year uh through reduced diesel consumption now that's going to help the bottom line because you know this expenditure it just kills the bottom line whatever you you may have made you you lose on this expensive price of diesel so it's going to help esam's financial position which we'll see in due course at the same time I mean businesses were struggling when it came to you know issues around load sheding uh some were even forced to close their doors you know what does this all mean uh for businesses and small businesses in particular in South Africa well of course as as you said in your intro this is going to impact an es fighted this uh you know economic growth in South Africa uh and and that reflects you know a complete range of um business activities which um you know benefit from reduced load shedding that is on the on the plus side and and yes I'm very grateful for that but the problems are not over uh and esom is asking for a price increase of 36% now that is going to really Hammer many many businesses so the good that has been done by reducing load shedding uh I fear could be counteracted if esam get their way and put up the price by by 36% that is going to Ripple through the economy uh it will be a major driver towards increased inflation and will be very damaging to many many business is uh big small and medium and uh also the person in the street will be feeling it very harshly in their pocket and as ascom has managed to keep the lights on at least for now can we safely say uh that low sh is behind us or is it still too early I think it is too still too early and it's not me that is saying that uh esim has cautioned us themselves the minister of electricity and energy has cautioned us that he's not yet ready to say that it's over and and he pointed to a few uh issues that needed to be resolved before we can say that this is over uh so for example just so that you know I mean kuberg unit one has been sorry unit number two has been out of service you know since the December last year was supposed to come back on in June July this year it's only going to come on in in December this year so about 6 months late if there are no further problems that that is concerning and that needs to be attended to in the same uh unfortunately seems as if we have lost our analyst there uh Chris yand who was actually also uh wrapping up uh his comments when it comes to 200 days uh low free in South Africa
pOpCikxF7k8,Tito Mboweni | Life and times of Tito Mboweni,2024-10-13T20:30:08Z,10790,president s Raposa has described the late d b as a compatriot who served the nation as an activist Economic Policy innovator and a champion of Labor rights but when he grew up in zanin in the limo Province he attended the University of the north Between 1979 and 1980 where he registered for a bachelor of Commerce degree before leaving South Africa to go into Exile following the establishment of the government of national Unity boeni was appointed to serve as minister of Labor from 1994 to 1999 in the cabinet of President Nelson Mandela he was instrumental in legislating the labor market regime and in the passing of basic conditions of Employment Act and the Labor Relations Act while despite oppositions from the private sector B pushed for the laws to be passed we're convinced that sufficient consensus has been reached on the basis of which we can approach Parliament cabinet agrees with us in that assessment we have briefed business and labor about it and there have no opposition to us proceeding to go to Parliament so I think the ground we have taken into consideration many many issues which had been raised by business and labor and we have Incorporated some of them into the bill there are others which we couldn't really incorporate them into the bill we tried our best but we couldn't nevertheless the total package of the bill it's acceptable it's Progressive it will improve the conditions of the most vulnerable of workers in the country he served as the first black governor of the South African Reserve Bank for a decade from 1999 with a sharp focus on fiscal discipline Independence and economic transformation in a statement the bank has described him as a passionate Central Banker who played a key role in shaping the organization B was credited for leading the implementation of South Africa's inflation targeting policy aimed to reduce inflation within the target of 3 to 6% B told economists that his appointment had initially spared concerns among investors it was announced that I was going to come to the bank and thing was well the markets took a dive uh do these black people know about running a central bank I mean the disaster was on the horizon um but fortunately things very prly some of the friends that I uh have made uh particularly from Reus we invited me for a live interview right across the markets and the only thing that they were interested in presidental was whether my appointment meant the beginning of the end of the independence of the southan Reserve Bank now that Independence thing it will seem will be a problem for me for the rest of my stay here as many other people have tried to undermine that Independence uh by doing all kinds of things there were Rumors in 2009 bweni was forced to leave the bank when then president Jacob Zuma appointed Jill Marcus as the governor honesty and non nonsense approach would often make him unpopular in both government and the private sector I've enjoyed excellent working relationships with the presidency and also the national treasur and the Minister of Finance both the current one and the previous on um and I'm really grateful for this opportunity to have served now coming to the side issue about what do I plan to do in future I think I have a bit of time to go fishing from 2018 to 2021 boeni served as Minister of Finance in the administration of President sah ramaa where he played a crucial role in shaping the country's economic policies B inherited a weakening budgetary process where many targets were missed with a growth Outlook being revised down contain the cost we're in a better position to invest in growth enhancing uh um Investments and it is the growth announcing Investments which over time will also give us sufficient Revenue that allows us to also begin to reduce the debt but there are other debt management strategies uh that we can but it also means controlling some of the big ticket items whether it's about uh funding for state-owned Enterprises whether it's about our own remuneration costs whether it's about as I said procurement and other things but these big ticket items are a big problem dweni distinguished himself in different strategic roles in the private sector including serving on the board of Anglo gold as Shanti details around his funeral are yet to be announced sabc news in hburg we knowen as a good person I know him he was a minister of finance and let his soul rest in peace we are here on a vacation in Cape Town

1iVukZrs0Dg,Discussion | SACP remains anti-GNU: Prof. Ntsikelelo Breakfast,2024-10-13T20:24:19Z,5156,joining us now to discuss the day's development is political analyst Professor Nono breckfast and he joins us now via our video link Mr breckfast thank you so much for your time this evening here in sabc news I mean lot of political developments taking place today but let's start off with what took place inan we saw the newly elected mayor Dr Nas moo there of course announcing uh her mayoral committee today and of course forming part of thec f f action essay as well as the good party what are your thoughts on that mayoral committee my main concern is that Coalition formations at local government level in particular covering the period of 2016 until to date have tended to be unworkable and unstable uh largely because the political Elite when they come into power they don't normally bring with them a model of development that will have Buy in from the locals um but also I think they have a tendency to rush into joining forces without developing a conflict management mechanism to deal with their own internal contradictions so I'm not quite sure if this H composition will yield positive results because we've seen uh more often than not when these uh Coalition arrangements are constituted the they lead to a zero some game as opposed to a win-win situation and and normally it's the citizens that are on the back foot so I I hope that this Arrangement will lead to um a service a delivery development and the qualitative Improvement of the lives of the people and of course uh uh Professor you know this is what the residents in swana have been complaining about it is due to you know the issues around the delivery of services of course uh the mayor there Dr nasip MOA earlier saying to my colleague that you know as much as some may criticize this team but it really is not a junior team what do you have to say about the expertise that she has roped in well there are people are very senior in terms of being in the mayor even the the mayor on herself I think she was the deputy mayor before she became mayor Dr MOA uh there are also other people from the ANC where held strategic positions before but I think the proof of the puting is in the E remember politics and administration are like two sides of the same coin so um it's going to take a lot of doing for the the political leadership to to make sure that there is a a change of um heart in terms of how things are done in uh they need to work side by side with the um officials and and also with the with the citizens I think the first thing that they need to do in my view is to is to hold a series of meetings with the um with the locals and then make the ITP which is a 5e strategic plan alongside the um LED those are antipoverty policies that that that that need to be introduced and also attract uh investment and grow the economy with the hope that there will be a trinkling Down effect at the same time you know talking about some of the reaction which has come out from the former mayor he has described this as a coalition of chaos and saying that uh you know the roping in now of the eff into the mayoral committee is bad news for the city of tuana your thoughts on that I don't think that he saw this coming that he was going to be disl from the Helm of power and also you must remember that he feels a a betrayed by um action sa that made a vow before that they will never work with the ANC because the ANC is a corrupt and then all of a sudden they uh change gear and then worked with the ANC um so the da is still with with the broken heart but also it has thrown a span at The Works in terms of the the deliberations between the da and the ANC in the N Madela Bay I think there were some talks that um they were going to engage in a a coalition um Arrangement so um the da is very much a a disappointed that it was removed from power and to coming now to the issues around thec uh and its tripartite Alliance of course talking about the sacp tomorrow the ANC will be uh you know celebrating and marking that 100 days of the government of national Unity the sacp has been quite vocal uh saying that they are not happy uh with the fact that there is some sort of an alliance now or Coalition uh with the da on a national scale they have declined uh to attend those celebrations are you surprised at all by this move no um of course not because what brings together thec sap and KATU is the national Democratic Revolution which is a two-stage theory that you got to have a Time whereby the revolution is led by the Zas I think that's the phase that we are in now um but at the same time the working class must be made ready to take over so I think the thesis that is being Advanced by the Communist party is that the second phase of the revolution is not going to be Advanced under the current circumstances and that it never gave this Arrangement um um a Buy in uh you must have heard them saying that they they are sensing a danger that there won't be a gravitation who H brought poor policy IES that the da maybe might pull to a different direction in terms of what they call neoliberal policies uh no wonder they have decided not to join the ANC tomorrow when they are celebrating a 100 days of gnu at the same time as uh the ANC celebrates 100 days of the gnu they were actually meant to have a meeting a bilateral meeting uh with the sacp uh tomorrow and that will not will not be taking place of course now because we know that the ANC will be celebrating the 100 days of the gnu what does it say about the state of the relationship between the two in my opinion there's nothing peul about the way things are I'm not saying that the way things are is the way things should be but it's not something new I mean the sap and thec they've always Crossed Swords in public even during the time of G during the time of former president bakey um and so so there's nothing new and also you're talking about two organizations which have two uh different ideological pillars so to speak I mean the Communist party has its own constituency which is the working class the ANC is a broad church so you will have those uh tensions but also I think what has compounded the the situation is basically the uh public specs that we have seen between uh the s G of the ANC um the Secretary General of the Communist party and maybe also uh the the premier of they they've not been speaking the same language uh I've seen in one of the weekly newspapers the the the Secretary of kzn of the aenc also taking a swipe at the SG of um the so those um postures I think are escalating the the tension within the ANC all right Professor thank you so much for your time and for that Insight on a number of political developments which took place today that is Professor nigalo breakfast political analyst there giving us his insights in terms of uh you know what has unfolded today and what will continue uh throughout the week let's take a quick ad break we'll have more news for you when we return stay with us for

and career of the former Minister and Reserve Bank governor t let us now at sabc TV so as tributes continue to PO in for former Finance Minister tieni his former special advisor in 1994 when he was appointed minister of Labor Leslie maror says simeni played a vital role in cementing the monetary and fiscal policy framework in South Africa this is what he had to say let me start by expressing my deepest condolences to the family of uh tieni as well as his close uh friends the Friends Network more broadly as well as his comrades in African National Congress I've known for the last 34 years having met him soon after the unbanning of thec he played as we all know a very critical and crucial role in the design of the modern Economic Policy framework of uh South Africa ditto played a vital role in developing young policy makers people like myself and and many others in the early uh 990s were inspired by him and the leadership of of the ANC to study economic policy to go and obtain master's degrees and some people obtain PhD degrees and he really um made us believe in ourselves uh inspired us to want to be world class and operate at the highest level whether it be at the G20 World economic Forum annual meetings the IMF and and then the World Bank uh meetings and so on dto elevated South Africa's stature in international economic policy making uh sou Africa played in the Premier League as a result of his sharp mind and intellect we will miss him but he has reached he has left a lasting Legacy in the economic policy fabric of South Africa all right we've got lots to discuss let's get on with the discussion we've gathered the better Minds at the sabc here to explore the various aspects of TM bweni we have Sophie mwena sabc News International editor as well as Sac political Editor zbe to both of you thank you very much indeed for joining us it's important to have your perspective on this because you both have worked or followed his career at various stages of his life he gave off no doubt a sense of Vitality um obviously prolific on on social media sentiment on the ground what are you hearing Sophie well I think uh one thing that happened last night when the news uh broke you saw people more united particularly talking about the different roles that D was engaged in and also the sense of humor as you spoke about the skills in relation to uh cooking and so you saw young and old talking about this man and not only inside the country but outside the country as well as you know that he went to loto uh and where he graduated and of course it is in that country where he also gets support for further educ in terms of going abroad linking with the African National Congress in Tanzania to get a support and scholarship then went to the United Kingdom where he met the former president of thec oo and the former president taboi therefore people were just talking about dto a human being a minister of Labor the first governor of the res Bank Post 1994 black and also talking about dto the Finance Minister the controversies around the economic policies and also How firm and feisty he was you spoke about that aspect of his personality in terms of humor uh just before I come to you control cop that uh clip we had him remember uh on the program in June just before the cabinet was announced talking about this new government Arrangement um and something that he spoke about was the the issue of getting everybody on the same page and how it's going to work with regards to the executive how it's going to work with regards to the legislature we'll get that clip in a short while but talk to us about how he saw himself within the new dispensation how his career changed over the years very good evening to you Blain and Sophie and obviously the viewers I think one one of the takeaways really from um the late Minister and the late governor of The Reserve Bank is that he lived the way the life the way he wanted to right it didn't matter what sort of um responsibilities he had of course he would discharge those those responsibilities but he was always within what he wanted to do I mean how many people will just decide and go to the president and say you know Mr President I think I've done enough so do you want to release me so because it seen as the PO job and and I mean I'm not even going to speak about some of the things that he was doing or the clothes and stuff like that so he basically projected himself the way he wanted to he was an intellectual he was quite brilliant I mean he understood his stuff and then not lost on him he knew that he possessed that so he he wasn't scared by anything I mean even those controversies he would just shoot from the hip and he would get the opportunity to do some of those things it wouldn't be possible during our conversation I thought I heard him say that he was interested in the job uh this was back in June just before the cabinet was announced so I asked him a question with regards to whether he's interested this is what he had to say take a look is that me hearing you putting your hand up for a position in cabinet I think I'll make sure that my phone is Switched Off when when he was appointed Finance Minister did he take that reluctantly I think it happened at the time where he did not have a choice to say no remember they are schooled in a particular way from the Congress movement where you get assigned responsibilities where you get deployed to do certain responsibilities here was an emergent situation remember and had been pointed to that situation but because of the controversy around what has been had been happening at the zondo commission so he had to step aside and then the president I mean that's a key portfolio and then the president needed someone who the markets were quite used to not only the markets but someone who understood that kind of a role so he then immediately um plugged into that role I think effortlessly and I think what I remember bla and Sophie about this is that um it was just a few days before for there was to be a a a a a a a a budget speech it was a few days was a budget speech and then I remember when after after delivering that budget speech people were saying so did you have to um learn a lot from this he said no you know because I understand I understand this area so it was easier for me to craft it right um you're not seeing things we brought in another guest we want to expand this conversation Journal are never late they always delayed it's BMT is sabc specialist researcher thank you sir for for your time I'm going to come to you with regards to uh moen's play in the world of Economics uh but Sophie said something interesting in terms of how we were schooled and we know that he he did uh schooling in lutu as well in terms of tery um talk to us about how I when I look at his career that's where you kind of figure out that that's where economics intersected with politics you know how talk to us about his relationship with the mountain kingdom yes the professor who uh assisted at Roma University then and now called the National University of loto spoke about uh how at that moment when he was doing a degree in politics particularly focusing on the region the Frontline States and how he was helping him at that time that included economic issues but going to London or going to UK and abroad getting education it started there and that's where he is confident or convinced that that's where he became even more interested in economics now meeting taboni The Economist who studied at Sussex and you know when you engage in beggy it takes hours and hours and hours and you come out there having a different uh view of issues and I think at that moment also that engagement withy contributed to his interest in economics and when he was sent to Zambia at the age n offices in Zambia where he was responsible for economic issues him participating in the drafting of ready to govern and this is a document outside uh the country before ANC became uh the governing party H he was involved in that and therefore you can see where it all started and when one thing that Professor suai Santos said was that when he was the minister of Labor he requested the professor from Lou uh to support him in that department and they drafted a document H that speaks to you know social Compact and that word will you remember social compact that's exactly what the president now is talking about and they included in that work the labor organizations such as nuum you can imagine the role that that you can think of in terms of also the former n secretary or general secretary R James so you can see that he met many people yeah along the way who influence his uh way of uh Paving way for his career but generally he really liked uh the issues that are related to economics that is why even today he's sitting on or he was in the boards of different companies but also an organization on the continent that's looking at the economic issues uh in a Pana africanist uh ideology in terms of building the continent I will touch on that in in a short while very instrumental obviously in nedlac as well um talk to ASI look he was he was Reserve Bank governor for a decade former Finance Minister what's your understanding with regards to his approach to fiscal discipline as well as economic transformation sure I don't know where to start um boen was a colossal figure when it comes to the world of macroeconomic policy when it came to the world of Public Finance Management um I think the biggest challenge that the 1994 generation had was to balance a number of issues that changing Global landscape in terms of ideological setup you had a situation where the the the Soviet Union that had supported the armed struggle was collapsing and most of the Liberation Fighters were schooled in that economics but now you had guys like Tito boeni at a very tender age of 35 years who understood the importance of aligning uh properly when it comes to the future of microeconomic policy which now it is evident that has been shaped by and large by neoliberal approach and when it comes to that he never lost his conscience in terms of uring that while we are pushing for a microeconomic policy that aligns with a a a macroeconomic policy that is a globally sound if I may use because at that time capitalism seemed to be the way that was bringing success and South Africa as a state that was emerging from aparate they needed to balance that to ensure that when we go in there we don't go with the policies that are going to collapse the country but at the same time we can't go hardcore on neol liberal economic policies so they had to be a balance so for me he stood out for that because he was young but he understood global global Dynamics in terms of the uh economic setup but at the same time he was very very caring when it comes to addressing the social economic needs of that young democracy called South Africa at the time it's interesting mentioned that um M with regards to his approach not everybody agreed with his policy ideas the eff released a statement uh today talking about they had their differences but what they admired about him is that he wasn't shy to engage in robust debate talk to us about how his policy ideas resonated with political parties yeah in fact I'm actually reminded of when you look at at policy H I think it was just before he joined government um I think in 2018 when he tweeted he basically said why don't you I think nationalize post Bank you know and it came out of the blue and then you you looked at this individual who you've always thought he he he behaves in a particular way but interestingly PL is that in a few months he was to be appointed the Finance Minister and then people started asking questions to say okay this is what you told us are you going to do it now so clearly he was operating in an environment really where you you are Guided by certain conditions um because you can't I mean sometimes you can't believe in in a particular project but it has to operate within a bigger project where you have to align with others I see was to come in there I think in the90s uh there was a time where he was engaging media at that time and he spoke about this issue where he pointed out to the journalist then that uh uh the the the issue of uh Socialism or the way you think about Russia and and China it is because people believe in it because of their circumstances if you don't change the lives of the poor and the marginalized this is the root for them but he also pointed out that when they come in or what needs to happen with South Africa in terms of reforms and changes you have to focus on building a strong domestic uh the economy Reliant not only on foreign direct investment but also on people in the country investing in that economy and then you create jobs then you'll find a way when you give guarantee to the labor organizations in terms of job security to manage issues of salaries and all of that but secondly he he he he also when zo spoke about that uh message on social media he was saying the politicians must look at establishing a state bank and now we are told it's happening secondly he spoke about 40% that must be owned by States in terms of minerals so it wasn't 100% And I think you are correct to say he at times he was trying to balance different interests but the reality is this is someone who grew up in the country Country Side poor background understood the plight of the poor and that is why in the '90s already he was talking about you can't just criticize people who believe in socialism when so many people are poor and look at China today well let's hear from the community uh Val before I come to you the community of zanin in lopo in particular where the late uh Minister Tien hailed from they've expressed of course sadness right uh about his passing the residents say that they are no doubt mourning with his family I was certained about the passing of I would like to send words of condolences to theen family the untimely passing on of um our beloved dear brother leer mentor and and and our family member go last night was a very sad news for us and we felt very disturbed I'm very certained by's passing my condolences to his family God says his close to those with broken heart God loves them we love you and we also loved him too I learn about his passing last night he was a good trustworthy finance minister to theen family you are not alone in this difficult situation to the word on the street we also took our cameras out to the streets of Johannesburg this morning to gauge people's views on tieni this is what they had to say was such a gentleman man especially when was a finance minister every every time when I listen to him uh his budget speech you could tell that something was going to change so now since he G but I hope other members or NC members have learned a lot from from him as well as other upcoming um politicians he was a corrupt free man I've never had a scandal of him even if you follow him on Twitter he was like like cooking and he his shoes yeah I think he always had a an educated um research position on whatever issues he was addressing um sometimes he took a strong stand and was not always popular but uh I think he was a a man of his convictions and um you know he certainly stood out I was really shocked I think Tito is someone who's so like despite all the work he's done he's also been really fun on Twitter with all his recipes um and I think he added a very personal touch with that you know we don't often get to interact with our ministers and with like the political space but he brought a fun element to it and when he told me this morning I was like ah the recipes we're going to miss all of that I follow him I'm a big admirer so I follow him on social media he always posts his culinary uh experiences with us so um I was really SED by his death it it came as a shock I really admire that gentleman he was a really professional man highly regarded respected and I was one of the people who really thought highly of him indeed we do appreciate your views lots more to discuss we're going to flesh out this various aspects of his life in a short while stay with us welcome back we talking about The Life and Times of tieni you're watching its topical it's the topical story today so we have to get on it and give you context that's what this program is all about to help you better understand what this person meant in the context of South afric's political as well as economic uh dispensation tenure period and then better understand how we can get to better it's important let's bring in our digital audience now they've been joining us from various parts of the country uh I want to start with uh zipo zipo uh your thoughts uh your impressions about titon Bowen and the Legacy he leaves behind thank you very much BL um just to start off to send condolences to um Mr moen's family um but for me I want to say that his career to myself is more of a career where there's a lot of all it's all Sizzle but no stake um if you look at it you are a young labor Minister um at 35 years old um you most significant thing that you do is help our labor draft our labor laws that we have currently but i' would love to ask South Africans what do they currently feel about those labor laws are they really helping them materially you move on to your um days as a governor first black Governor a lot of Sizzle lot of excitement but the only memorable thing most South Africans will say they have of that is that um he inspired Casper's hit song so it's it's it's at the end of the day we need to start holding leaders um to higher account to say okay what are they actually doing materially I'm hearing um the the guests in the studio um but for me I I think D B out of every politician in this country had the the best opportunity to deliver a state bank for this country you're the governor of a Reserve Bank and you're the Finance Minister you have understanding on the legislative side and you have understanding on on on how um what it takes to create a bank and to make it functional so for me if I sum all of that up yes very well educated man very likable man but what material um um achievements did he achieve that changed the the life of the South African materially all Sizzle no stake bil says zipo um I was listening to some comments made by safter General Secretary Zulan zavi who was talking about the basic uh conditions of Employment Act um and how those that kind of act all those terms and conditions within that act wouldn't be possible if it didn't have a sympathetic minister of Labor talking about TI buen talk to us about how what zipo said marries with with the work that he has done well let's also just to go a little bit back um Moen was comes from as a gold uh generation of that time when it comes to uh as I said looking at the economic policy and also looking at the social economic challenges that the country was facing so as a minister of labor at the time we understand that we came from an uper background where the rights of workers weren't as heightened as they were supposed to be there was a lot of abuse and there was a lot of should I say environment that was not conducive for workers so the bringing in of that basic conditions of Employment Act it served to ensure that whoever does business as a as as as a businessman in South Africa as an employer they have a set of rules in which they need to adhere to yet at the same time it provided workers with a comfort of knowing that when they give their labor it's not going to be exploitative manner in which it was happening previously so that was very important but also another point is during that time there was a formation of nlac so which brought in several Partners when it comes to business economics and labor it was important at the time because the interests were so much different you would understand that with the labor side of things they were advocating for socialist perspective on how things are supposed to be done yet business was scared that if that uh policy is advanced at the of balancing the microeconomic policy landscape it was going to be a problem yet at the same time you needed to bring them together to the table to say for the labor what are your expectation and what are you bringing to the table for the future of South Africa as business what is it that are going to change what is that going to put to ensure that you ease the the fear of the workers to say we have been abused we have been exploited previously and then also when it comes to the investment it brought a lot of confidence for investors because we understand that in in the economy if you have if you lose the the the confidence of the markets and you are skating on a very thin ice that you you on a slippery slope your economy May collapse at any time so for him to come up with that net not only him but to be a force to ensure that netl started at that time was very important but again the issue of C ccma I mean most workers did not have a platform where they could voice their concerns when they felt that they have been unfairly treated so at that time a lot of progressive policies came basic conditions of Employment Act institutions like ccma netl that shows that the men had a vision and the men could see that we needed a balance to go to the future I wonder how that Vision played out on the continent as well as in the global stage um he was appointed as part of the Au reforms advisory committee and Paul kagame uh it's basically aimed at improving the conditions so that the organization can you know tackle challenges on the continent uh talk to us about his role on the continent Sophie well uh there was a time where the Au took a decision to ask the Rwandan president Paul kagami to set up or to come up with recommendations in terms of how the Au can transform and he set up this committee uh it was uh composed of a very uh senior czen Africans on the continent that included people like the deputy Secretary General of the United Nations Dr Amina Muhammed he was part of that and after they made all those recommendations one of the recommendation was that there must be a peace fund so that the peacekeeping you fund those projects you don't rely on external uh funders that might have vest interest on the continent and abuse the resources that they they inject on the continent to arrive at their own personal interest as countries outside the continent so he was the chairperson of that uh peace fund and a few weeks ago he actually had a meeting and he had uh been able to get funds for that job to ensure that you have peacekeeping forces on the continent where there are hot spots and that is funded on the continent because one thing that was pointed out after that work of kakam was that you can't rely on external funders to fund the Au because the issue of influence will continue and therefore he he was part of that but also returning to the colleague or the uh the the contribution that what what did he do when he was Labor what did he do as Reserve Bank when you look at the Reserve Bank in particular when he went there 88% of management was white and already male you can understand transforming the institution was a difficult task the other issue when he uh went back to finance you'd recall that there was a time in 2008 there was economic m down and clearly he would come up with the policy that didn't sit well with labor and other people who saw those uh policies as neoliberal and therefore it's true that there were criticism but the question is was he available to engage with people and hear them out and that's exactly what Floyd Shambo today said that much as we differed on policies he was able to engage us he even helped me with my Master's Degree at vets the same with malma who has just released a video talking about the relationship but also pointing out that there were sharp differences criticism notwithstanding IM um and no doubt some of these policy ideas rub people up the wrong way uh towards the end of his life and his career his political career talk to us about his stance within thec was he liked was he respected well I think as a person who was really well known and his contribution very well known um you would always have because the NC now has factions unfortunately and you'd have you'd always have people who would believe in you and you'd always have people who really uh don't believe in you but I mean all around I think everyone respected the kind of a person he was in fact I'm reminded as we are speaking about issues around the economy and the and the and the divorce World economic Forum you you know that not many people know that he actually is the one who came up with the nine wasted wasted years when he was a divorce at the world economic Forum so he was the kind of a person who was very um upfront about what he believed in but at the same time he is the person who would just go on social media and said um referring to the former president Zuma for example he would say hey well let's sit down let's talk you can't do this to us so it's someone who really if he felt a particular way he would just do that I think that's why the different strengths within the ANC would somehow respect the kind of a person he was they may not have liked some of the things that he said or he stood for but they at least knew what he believed in without him just saying this or that yeah he wasn't afraid to say what he believed and he also questioned the the the term of the government of national Unity um calling it something different uh he was on this very show questioning how this is Being Framed let's go now to our digal audience let's get more insight in some of their uh experiences or the impressions of the Man known as tiumen po let's talk to you your thoughts of course um I think one of the things that he'll always be remembered for was his feisty leadership um I think people knew him as somebody who was very blatant and didn't really know how to sugarcoat things which I think sometimes um did to play against him um some of the things that we obviously would remember him for was the fact that he was very strongly against how often the government would bail out State Enterprises such as your SAA and your um escom and even advocated at some point for the privatization of those state-owned Enterprises which often put him at odds with factions within thec and we also know him for reducing the public sector wage bill which then him at odds with with trade unions as well as workers because critics claimed that those austerity measures that he pushed for would negatively affect for people and the working class disproportionately so those are some of the things that will always be attached to him but on the other side do know that he wanted to Champion for economic reforms and he was very conservative with um pe's approach when it cles to fiscal matters and then that maybe sometimes led to trouble in balancing his fiscal discipline with meeting the societal um need right you know and so a question we could pose is were those policies really effective did his conservatism help because during his term unfortunately the government debt only increased and we didn't see a uh reduction in unemployment rate or overall poverty rate in South Africa so there are those positives and those negatives of his legacy and then on the other side of things I think on the lighter note would be a lot of people got to know him Beyond politics because of social media right you will always be remembered for his overuse of GOC and um terrible there you go there you go exactly we will know him for his very questionable fashion and how he didn't mince his words when it came to either conversing with constituents or even lead ERS and I think to an extent there is that need when it comes to politicians we need that level of honesty that level of um being blatant but then there also needs to be an understanding of sensitivity when it comes to certain matters but overall I think we will he he lived a good Mark on a lot of people's lives and then much like the late prent Gordon there will also be some things that people will always criticize about his leadership and people will always like zon did say um we'll always feel like there was more to do yeah from yes po thank you very much indeed Val never mined his words but he definitely minced the garlic you know with tieni I think it goes with all politicians with who are very solid when it comes to the school of Economics it's very difficult to please everyone let's start there because as a man who studied economics who understood what needed to be done fiscal prudence was one of the key things for him so when it comes to the issue like government bailouts he questioned a lot that look the companies are supposed to be bringing something the state owned entities are supposed to be bringing Revenue to the state coffers but instead it's the other way around it looks like it is government that keeps on pouring money out and he was very strict on that I know that unions did not like that because they felt that if government was not bailing out some s soes it would lead to some of them collapsing but but it was very important for him to stand his ground and say look if it doesn't bring money to us why do we keep on pouring on the bucket that is leaking and then secondly when it comes to the issue of him you know that tweet in 2018 when he proposed about 40% ownership of the uh minerals it came from a heart that says government needs money at its coffers but when if we look into our economy where the money is at he said the money is at the financial sector so therefore we needed a state-owned bank the man is in the mining sector therefore government needed a bigger chunk of that ownership so that the state Coffer will have more funds to use he was very much against borrowing um at some point in time he used the the illustration of a hippo with the Jaws I mean there was a debt so it's going to Chow the the funds that are going to be spent on the future so for me I would say it goes to the extent that former president tabi sometimes got Miss understood because when you stand strictly on a sound fiscal policy you are not going to please a lot of people also when you stand very sound on the issue of monetary policy I mean M sop has just mentioned that when he entered the Reserve Bank in institution at that time he was a first black Governor it it must have felt somehow for those who were controlling the economy at the time to say this chap perhaps is bringing a lot of changes but he became very Resolute and he made sure that he introduced proper governance in that in institution while it was transforming but he never compromised in terms of ensuring that the the the monetary policy in South Africa becomes independent of politics yes he's a politician but when he was acting on that role he wanted to make sure that monetary policy becomes independent I wonder who did he draw from Sophie uh be it on the continent be on the world stage in terms of his political stance his Economic Policy stance do you have any Insight in terms of that well I think as I pointed out he was able to interact with people like oo in terms of the political responsibility that would include the social responsibility if you hear stories around oo he was the people's uh leader and therefore that social part was there he interacted with people like tabi who's an economist and therefore he would then have those traits or those uh instincts of being a shrew Economist and that wouldn't sit well with certain sector of the society because a society is constituted of different people with different interest but also in terms of loto again go back to loto the professor is talking about how they worked very close and when I'm talking about the document that pro pro Professor spoke about where he compiled a document with some people on the social compact he says if that document was implemented at that time that was linked to the RDP South Africa wouldn't have been where it is today so and and also in in some of the interviews in the '90s he he he spoke about a need to ensure that H you you you you change the life of the people but of course when they took power thec then they had to amend certain approach and that didn't sit well with people and it is true that those who were frustrated had a right also to express their views like they've already indicated earlier on the weaknesses but the issue is when you look at the practicality what would you have done m sometimes when we talk you must say what could I have done to change the situation if I was given that uh position I think that's where we have to to be as a nation you know to talk about how do we Implement good policies how do we Implement not just criticize but how do we Implement s and makes it very interesting because um as Sophia said he did get the opportunity of being the finance minister so where he set right where the decisions were made um so did he go far enough and what then led him to go to the president to say well I've done enough can you just Release Me You Remember When the president relieved him of that position it was not the firing so it was him having requested that he needs to be released but of course having come on the back of all that he had said and when he wrote that tweet at I think when you at the records around around 4:00 a.m. so clearly there was something that was bothering him and then you get the opportunity to do that so what is so difficult um here are your leaders here are the people you grew up with this is the mission when you took over power this is what you decided you were going to do so what is so difficult about it and also which I found interesting he also felt that perhaps our leaders by our leaders I mean here in the country were were less decisive that's why time again he would refer to Paul kab to say look at how it's done there and time and again he will just remind us about Kali other people are saying Paul KAG is a dictator so that's the problem with leadership you you you can't always be right which is uh correct in terms of being a human and making mistakes but do you listen but I think the point um which he was trying to make I think um was that so as someone who is in charge you need to be decisive about where you want to go I mean look at where um not you Rwanda is going you may not necessarily like the manner in which um their democracy plays out because I don't know a lot of democracies where it produces 99% of of the outcome but it's happening there and you can see where they going you may disagree with it but decisive they are definitely and when he tweeted about that I think he had think like those in mind all right let's bring back our digital audience um let's bring back myola as well as L myola to you first uh good evening to everyone in studio as well as at home so with me as a young person young student who's going into the finance industry for me when it comes to uh I feel like what has happened now is that we have lost a well of knowledge and for me in terms of his qualities he was a leader without with or without positions meaning for me he's thought out as a person that communicates that you don't need to be in a certain position in order for you to be a leader and I think uh another thing is one thing in terms of the transfer of knowledge one question I have is how do we then transfer these knowledge of the people who are who have this experience to the younger people which is us so that we can make our own decisions essentially how do we capture and transfer the information to the Next Generation cuz I feel there's not a lot of knowledge transfer essentially good point uh Lil let's hear from you thank you her indeed as a country we have lost an icon including International the men who have the sense of you can hear people there interacting with him on twiter social media he was there for everyone he was the government of the people I would also like to indicate three item which I will communicate with is the issue of Labor during his tenure as the minister right he ensure that he Advance the rights of the employees because he also prated the employment Equity Act is there today everyone is enjoying those constitutional rights have to there because I think there's some inter interference there but we got your point thank you so much uh for your comments all right just before you get some final thoughts hopefully you have time for final thoughts but on a lighter note it was a a witch's brew as they say enough to turn the stomachs of the most hardened Economist the financial turmoil looming Dow grades and stagnant growth and back in 2018 I'm talking about added the threat of quantitative easing and it was a recipe for disaster but instead of losing sleep The Keeper of the nation's purse at the time was kept on stirring the pot here is our producer Mar kab cooking former Minister tien's Kitchen Story take a look so help me God so help me God a job nobody could be fighting for growing an economy decimated by wasteful expenditure and too many s in the trough also so when the going got tough de Management strategies the former finance minister went cooking it was not going to rival Master Chef but he did have a few tried and tested favorites chickens were free range fresh from the garden into the PT to be turned into Tito's Famous Chicken shoe shared with thousands of followers some of whom just didn't hide their disdain and amazement at a table sometimes only set for one his culinary efforts gave rise to the hash tieni Challenge and ex or Twitter followers stepped up to the plate unfaced by nayas the minister kept Channing out hotti BRS and shoes the menu as unpredictable as the markets so it turned out a bonus if you could Source a local delicacy but his weakness for taint pill charts had some unintended consequences a windfall for the manufacturer and elevated status for the chef who could then choose between being the minister of pchs or Mr Lista he called cooking a stress relief but was he feding in the kitchen while the country was Banning well respected his appointment to Cabinet was welcomed but it kept getting hot and hard in the kitchen however he kept stepping up in there and now stripped of the apron he has stepped down from the kitchen's heit his plate clean and the meal will be saved no longer Sac news Johannesburg many thanks to Mar there and many thanks to my fellow colleagues here m v and Sophie value added no doubt we've run out of time but the conversations as I always say will continue as we explore very every aspect of this man's life and what we can learn from it thank you very much indeed to all of you all right before we go here's my take tien's passing gives us an opportunity to reflect to reassess and to learn it's about putting purpose to pain right and there's a blessing in that why because he gave many a chance to understand understand what is real and what the next step should be right president Z Rapa reminded us that Tio is distinguish himself from in in in different strategic roles in the private sector and he was also a flag bear and global forum for for the country's economy as you heard what Sophia had to say in developing economies more broadly so maybe in passing from this life some of his life's lessons can be passed on to the rest of us and that's my take if you missed anything on this program then be sure to watch this episode of topical on YouTube democracy 30 up next with Oliver Dixon if you're watching a repeat of this program then as always the news continues until next week my brothers and sisters take care bye-bye
B-nwOjVix5Y,GBV | Columnist Bhekisisa Mncube on the unrelenting scourge femicide in SA,2024-10-13T18:20:50Z,515,let's take you to this now the unrelenting scourge of gender-based violence is ubiquitous and inescapable col columnist and writer beas is came to this realization when he inadvertently learned about the domestic his domestic helpers reality and fight with gender-based violence he now reflects on the instrumentality of the Interfaith community in defeating the scourge of gender-based violence and femicide now joins us for more P says good evening thank you so much your time really do appreciate it you talk about the instrumentality of the Interfaith community and what they can and are doing in assisting fighting The Scourge against gender based violence talk us through to some of those mechanisms well thank you very much for for for having me um I'm grateful uh to the faith action to end gender based violence collective in partnership with we will speak out South Africa and these are the people who are beading the inter Faith collaboration working together to end gender based violence and they have ABD doubted me as an often of of souls in terms of spiritual matters which I left church 30 years ago they've offered me the space to tell my story of abuse when I was growing up and to I don't know mold me into being a human being a person who could be a productive member of society so when I saw my domestic worker Christina coming to work and complaining of some bizarre alignment you know like having tested at a clinic for a kidney failure I was like but the clinics don't have that capacity and then the second time he she came um with another excuse that she had been moned she had blue eye and injuries which are classic forms of domestic violence it was that was a turning point for me so I sat down with my wife and said no we have to do something we are activist by nature and we I set her down I remember the fear in her eyes was that she was going to be fired you know and so I had to assure her that we want to get to the bottom of a problem I explained to her that the stories were not making up were not adding up as it were and she opened up to me that she had been abused by the boyfriend for the longest of time it wasn't like the first year that it had happened she had opened two cases that I saw the the case numbers and she had two protection orders against the same man who continuously was allowed to live in the same house with her in in spite of the protection orders I found that totally bizarre and unacceptable that you allow the perpetrator and the victim because she was not even a Survivor at a point to live in the same house and local police just did nothing that's whated me into action I want to read from what you wrote here and I find this particularly fascinating and I want us to double click on into that you're right the Interfaith strategy also calls for a reimagined restorative justice where accountability takes precedence over treating the bedroom as a private sphere immune to scrutiny what do you mean by that and of course that happens in the context of uh intimate partner violence as in the case of your helper whose boyfriend is the perpetrator here you say the bedroom should not be immune to scrutiny talk us through what you mean by that conceptually well it's actually quite simple I know I put it in some University jaon but the reality of the situation is that 80% of South Africans when they were interviewed numerous times by the the stats in terms of their religious affiliations 80% South Africans identify that they belong to some religion of sorts so we are very religious country forget about the denominations different types of churches but we are a predominantly a religious country so what happens the first point of call when we have travel is to seek pastoral care you go to your pastor it I'm say I'm using Pastor Loosely but you know in the in the Jewish Community is a different name in the Islam Community is a different name but you go to your pastor and explain your problem where the the the the problem begins is when the pastors wittingly or unwittingly begin to say no as a wife you must submit to your husband you must be a you must suck it up in a marriage is all founded on a woman sacrifices you know you can't have a partnership where only one person sacrifices and the other one is a metaphoric head of household what kind of a man is a head of household and beats M kill rap their partner and we still afford them the tiing head of the household so the bedroom can no longer be regarded as a private sphere it is a public sphere because it has got public consequences for the people who are abused behind the four walls where we do not know we don't hear the screams sometimes if we hear the screams we think they're coming in the other house not the house where it exactly happening sometimes if we hear and we know where it coming from you know you know my neighbor is is a member of the South African National Defense Force do you think if I hear a noise in that house I'll pick up a phone and and and phone the the the police and what if he becomes a war that I on the police a member of the the Army you know people who carry guns so it's it's it's not an easy task but what the point of the the Interfaith gender based violence prevention and mitigation strategy is that they are the first sector the Interfaith sector to actually have a sector strategy that supports the government of arching strategy to end gender based violence yeah at some point we'll talk more extensively around how we convert people from being passive bystanders to active Good Samaritans in intervening in such instances as you outlined there but unfortunately we are out of time desperately so thank you so much for your time really do appreciate it and that brings me to the end of my time here on the Sunday edition of the full view thank you so much for being with us of course at the top of the hour uh Blaine Herman will be bringing you the latest installment of its topical and I'll be back back with you at 8:00 p.m. taking a look at economic transformation over the last 30 years of our democracy on tonight's installment of democracy 30 My Name is Oliver Dixon thank you so much for your time zon is up next with your sports

having one seat uh what do you think the compromise there could have been for it to be this split good evening Olivia good evening to the viewers at home this could have been necessitated by the negotiations that took place amongst the different political parties that are in charge of the city it also reflects what appears to be a proportional representation especially having looked at the performance of these parties uh um during the elections but the overall winner in this whole exercise is the action SAA and thec action saa's mission to ensure that the da is removed from Power has B fruits and that is what they plan to do and it has also happened the desire by thec to be in charge uh in the city of ch has also B fruits because indeed they got many of the portfolios in the city of CH and at the end of the day the Democratic Alliance Remains the much bigger loser in this whole exercise yeah another interesting twist here is that uh the good party has a single seat in this 11 person meral committee importantly the good party is the only other party here that is a part of the governing Coalition at National level the government of national Unity which includes thec um what does that tell us about the Dynamics between what happens at a local level and what happens at a national level specifically given that action sa and the eff are not involved with thec at a national level but the good party is it's important to note that um the model of the gnu H which is taking place at National level has not necessarily been adopted at local level and um if indeed such is supposed to happen it will require negotiations from the role players at National level to ensure that they take it down unfortunately if indeed they had a plan of having that model at local level they could still do it but in the case of T they appear to have been late to do so but another aspect that you need to consider is that having the gnu does not necessarily mean that automatically things are going to happen that way in other levels of government we have seen that with the province ofen it has not been the case and it is also appearing not to be the case the biggest fear of the democratic Alliance in this instance has actually arrived the working together of thec and the eff F now with action sa and the good party could be something that the da feared and unfortunately it has actually happened now with the city of tan yeah the MMC of Finance is eugin mudis who's also the anc's chairperson in the Tuan region uh the Twan municipality the city of Tuan has a municipal Financial misfold which is to the extent of 13 billion Rand when you look at wasteful and and and un unregulated expenditure according to the auditor General's report it only has a capital expenditure budget of 2.1 billion Rand its collection rates are leaves much to be desired if they can't seem to turn around the finances and the state of finances of the city of T is it action sa that takes the blame here and they get punished in the next local government election or is it thec who has the position of MMC of Finance in Eugene M the state of the finances in the city of swan is something that um those that are involved in the governance of the city should be worried about and indeed that is a potential to negatively affect other projects of the city of t uh my view is that those that are given the responsibilities to run the finances of the city should not do what um others have done in the past um focusing on the mistakes of the predecessors and not focusing on the responsibilities at hand my expectation is that in the next four to 6 months we should be seeing the finances of the city of T stabilizing we should see Service delivery going to the very same areas where they say the Democratic Alliance has neglected we need to see um the city of T going standing on its foot financially but also at the same time being able to provide the much needed services that ordinary citizens require Leo thank you so much for your time really do appreciate political analyst Dr leand do in case you had missed that Announcement by the mayor of the city of tan here is uh the maral committee that was announced in community and Social Development uh that is councel palis samud of thec Economic Development and spatial planning is councelor sarot of the good party environmental and agricultural management is councelor obak rapu of the eff the MMC of Finance is Eugene mudis of thec the MMC of Health ISAT mashaba of the E while corporate and shared services is councelor Kulu Mori of action sa housing andil settlements is councelor Aon malua of thec Roads roads and transport is councelor Tangi male of thec utility services is counselor France busho ofc and Community safety is

XqykKte6bqU,Tito Mboweni | Political career: Analyst Asanda Ngoasheng weighs in,2024-10-13T17:14:12Z,7632,political analyst Asanda joins us now to give us a sense and understanding of D's contribution in the political space thank you so much Asanda for your time it's always great being with you so as we continue paying tribute to the man that was the now the late former Minister dieni let's really maybe delve into the archives in terms of his political history where all began as a political activist back in the 1980s then ultimately minister of Labor 1994 to 98 essentially ushering him into the governor's seat in 1999 yeah thank you so much for having me I think T has a very interesting and a very interesting history he started out as a studying towards a a bcom at the UN at the North University back in the 80s and then he didn't finish that degree and went off the and went off to Exile in lutu that's when he started doing his work Congress and I think as as you know a big role as a la in forming the ways in which labor laws were implemented in South Africa and basically ensuring that South Africans who were workers their rights and to unionize because that's something that didn't exist in South Africa partake people were not allowed to talk the negative conditions that they were experiencing and they didn't have experiencing some harsh treatment as laborers or as workers and so important contribution made very critical contribution as The Reserve Bank um which was a role that hadn't been held by a black person he embodied it had with Kasper singing that song Tien because he was the first black man to be governor and therefore to have his signature South Africa's money but I do think that you know many have critiqued the ways in which he drove South Africa with Manuel and the others that are the so-call class of 96 put pushed for gear and other neoliberal policies which people are as having failed South Africa and led us to this are now 5% Africans social grants but I think you know a very difficult time that both and him were leading particularly the and it would have been very difficult to follow other policy outside of neoliberal policies because that is in terms of economics because happening in a effectively where were going the neoliberal route but the question that many has asked is was it necessary to do the full neoliberal policy policies so there is you know a mixed Legacy in that as I say labor laws and policies that he put in place to get people who work with as Leaders of thec Economic Policy transformation group know policies that really have States ofth Africa aside of our our labor policies but others are saying on the other hand you know lead us to the state that we are in now where we sitting with 45% of you know just talking about that mix Legacy there asand I spoke to the deputy Minister of Finance earlier on Mr David Mas who obviously uh you know had of course the the the the pleasure of working uh with the late governor and he was saying I mean uh D took a very hard stance on borrowing and spending by the state often making him the agony Uncle so to speak uh when it comes to policy and as well as other issues related to how the country actually goes about and actually spends that money so that it does not result to fruitless spending all right I understand we have lost you there a su we're going to try and reestablish that link with you in a short while
zV1UiTLvs84,"Tito Mboweni I Tributes by Pali Lehohla, Mpho Phalatse, Trevor Manuel and Cosatu's Mathew Parks",2024-10-13T16:50:21Z,1610,condolences continue to pour in for former Reserve Bank governor and Minister of Finance dto Titus moeni according to a statement from the family mbweni died at a Johannesburg hospital last night surrounded by loved ones the family has requested privacy during the difficult time as they cope with the profound loss further details will be shared in the coming days M served as the labor minister in the Nelson Mandela cabinet from 1994 up until 1999 he would later become the first black governor of the South African res Reserve Bank in 1999 for a decade until 2009 succeeding Chris stalls during his tenure as Reserve Bank Governor he was appointed honorary professor of Economics at the University of South Africa from the year 2000 to 2003 he will fondly be remembered for his cooking skills notably by Twitter followers with tinted Fish and Chicken being his favorite which he shared with his followers on the micro blogging site tributes are pouring in to honor his ific contributions to the country's economic landscape he was a very decisive I would say very stubborn h a very steadfast leader in his own own way H the moment I remember him very well where we had a very interesting encounter was when I had a problem with the Consumer Price Index which made in many ways made South African suffer h and a number of them suffered because we miscalculated the CPI I was going to talk to him about how we will review economic statistics and I was with the current statistician General going to see him in 2002 he was quite excited about it he received us well you could see in his eyes that he was expecting something bigger than what I was presenting to him so as we left he said stud Ian General I can see the PPI is behaving very well but the CPI is going the RO I said oh Governor there's no problem with the CPI I reassured him but it didn't take long before we realized that certainly the CPI was being miscalculated and we worked on this program very well and ultimately got the CPI quite correct in the country and improved the economic statistics of the country I also remember him well in his transform ative program that he worked on when he was Minister of Finance in 2019 and we had to confront each other where I we were proposing a different path and he was proposing his own path um and one of the things he said was well I'm going to consult the United Nations economic commission for Africa on this program and you guys if you are not following on what saying I'm not going to band and of course one would have to say well he was a very stubborn person H because whatever he was doing on that policy we haven't actually gotten out of the problem in South Africa as a minister of Labor I think he brought very Progressive laws into our environment H that are actually a times being challenged but certainly he as a minister of Labor brought very Progressive flws one cannot forget his cooking skills the love of pchart that he the the the mayor or the the Duke of mahu always entertained us with a number of skills very down toe kind of person certainly and uh he's greatly missed and real condolences to his family he left us at a tender age we still expected a lot from him and through and through he was a man of integrity he was an honorable man um very difficult for me to see these visuals but wow what what an incredible patriot who loved his country he also loved his party the African National Congress but he was a reasonable man he didn't put politics ahead of what was good for the country and that's why I could work well with him even though I was not a member of the the passing of uh my friend and comrade TI when um uh so suddenly uh is a is a is a deep loss uh Tito was always a very special human being uh throughout all the years from the way in which he embraced me when I first came to Shell House as thec headquarters and was as the head of the Department of Economic planning through our uh joint efforts in a number of efforts and the people people frequently talk about him as as Governor but I think the the groundwork was laid much before that uh Tito moen's insights into what went into ready to govern the Reconstruction development plan all preceding uh our our our election into government in 1994 and then I think that U what we need to acknowledge is the role that he played in in labor legislation that benefits lives of working people to the the basic conditions of Employment Act the Labor Relations Act the employment Equity act and then also the establishment of nedlac uh the nedlac act all of those came from the hands and minds of titoy and was focused on improving on the quality of life of people to make democracy really in the lives of people all of that preceded his tenure as as governor of The the Reserve Bank and sometimes you don't quite see uh what the governor does in quite the same way but Tito's battle to ensure that we could both attract investment into the country and keep uh interest rates low in the interest of of dealing with with the debt of people uh the protection of the banks in South Africa all of those uh were phenomenally important uh contributions That Tito made to laying the basis for a better life for all in South Africa it's a long story it's a long journey uh but I think it's one that we must cherish because his contribution has left an indel Mark in in all of our lives uh one of the issues that hasn't been spoken about in kisi is his deep passion for the African continent uh TI B was part of the uh institutional reform panel for the African Union um which was chaired by by um president Paul kagami of Rwanda Tito often tweeted about just how good he found things in Rwanda but was about understanding the need for institutional reform on the African continent that was a deep deep part of his life uh deep part of his commitment and his frequent travels to Kigali was an expression of of that body of work as well and then he comes back as Minister of Finance later so it's a long journey uh and I think a very sad loss uh he hadn't been ill for very long uh it was a very sudden departure uh and I think a deeply deeply felt loss it's quite a quite a shock I think none of us expected it um I think we really want to wish his family his colleagues his friends um our Ally the African National Congress well during this period it's never easy to lose a loved one and I think we want to pay tribute to the role that he has played uh during The Liberation struggle and also in building a Democratic Society afterwards um he definitely ran his race um he led a a powerful a an impressive journey and I think one that will inspire many generations coming after him and whilst we had disagreement at time we always respected his his Integrity his ethics his credentials and we appreciate his forthright his honest approach to to to to life and I think it is a sad loss as a sad moment in our Democratic dispensation for
HQNO4HH7jF4,Tito Mboweni | Lesotho lecturer Prof Sehoai Santho remembers remembers late icon,2024-10-13T16:37:25Z,6625,M was exiled in neighboring lisu where he also attended the National University of lutu he graduated in 1985 with an honest degree in economics and political sciences we now joined by former professor at the National University of lisu pro Santo who was part of D's educational Journey 1985 in September Prof thank you so much your CH thank you for joining us in 1985 you had WR a recommendation letter for tieni to thec which ultimately led to him taking off to the United Kingdom uh to pursue his master's degree uh in the UK talk to us about your relationship with uh uh T and where that had begun thank you very much thank you it's a pleasure to be here but it's it's a very sad time I have had a relationship with Tito for 41 years from 1983 when I came back from postgraduate studies to teach at the University of lutu and he was doing his second and third year and we immediately hit it off because he was a very bright student and then he did a course with Me 1984 1985 on the political economy of of southern Africa you remember that southern Africa was on fire then H the the struggle inside South Africa was hting up the state of emergency was about to be declared in Sou Africa part South Africa was destabilizing all the Frontline States uh including Angola mozambik in particular and also Zimbabwe and of course luchu because you remember the altim this led to the closure of the borders of lutu and the toppling of Chief Jonathan and the signing of the L Highlands Water Project now Tito did very well in my course on the Poli econ of southern Africa and after he graduated in September he asked me to do a reference for him to Mr Mohammad tickley who was running thec scholarship program in daram in Tanzania I did a very good reference for him and at the end of the reference I said Tito boeni is very committed to the liberation of South Africa and he's very committed to his organization the African National Congress he will prove to be an asset to thec that's what the letter said well I wanted him to get the scholarship badly and so he did and then he went to study at the University of norish in East Anglia from 86 to 87 I think and then after that we kept in touch and 87 he told me with great excitement that he has met ER president T Becki at the London office office of thec and of course as we say the rest is history because then they became very close and ultimately to came back to laka from the UK to be in the economics Department of thec then in 19 8889 we were in touch discussing perto and lnos of gorbachov and all the global issues that were happening which ultimately led to the decline of the Socialist world in 1990 we jointly organized with him when when he came back to L to see his family remember he had met his wife in my class M and we organized a very successful Conference of on Lou in a postart South Africa and he helped me to fundraise for that with the Swedish Embassy in lutu that conference recommended the possibility of L to considering integrating with Africa and it was well debated that proposal and also it influenced the Outlook of the national Union of Mind workers on those issues fast forward to when he became the minister of Labor he appointed me to serve on his presidential labor market commission from 1995 to 1996 we gave a report to president Mandela June 1996 where my responsib director was to do the chapter on the interaction between the South African labor market and the regional labor market migration issues if you like but we also proposed to in there for the first time the need for a social compact or a social Accord in the last chapter of the labor market commission report if that commission report had been taken to a heart I think it would have laid the foundations for a Social Democratic political economic framework building on the foundation of the RDP uh he then became governor of The Reserve Bank we still in touch and every year November he organized a Governor's dinner with all the diplomats in Petoria and he always without fail embarrass me by mentioning me in the crowd that I used to be his Professor which was nice but always embarrassing at times yeah but for the next 10 years he became the governor of The Reserve Bank and then after he finished his St we still kept in touch H but I I remember in particular during the 208 209 Global financial crisis Tito was one of the global experts that were asked by the IMF to review what happened in the United States with what were off balance seat unsecured loans and transactions and they ultimately recommended the need for Global Banks including big the biggest banks in the west to do to undergo stress tests to make sure that they have enough liquidity they have minimum reserves and they can withstand any stress that comes and then lastly he was passionate about Africa he served on the board of the of asset African Center for economic transformation based in Ghana Agra and he later served as a member of President Paul kagam commissional task team on the institutional reform of the Au and ultimately chared the Au peace fund board which has now mobilized a lot of resources yeah 200 million us Plus for p keeping in Africa so it's a long story absolutely my interaction with Tito yes yeah Prof thank you so thank you so much for being so detailed about your 41 year history with tieni u i mean it's it's beautiful to hear that he met his wife in your classroom sounds like quite the lecture to have been a part of really do appreciate it uh Prof Santo a former lecturer at the University of lisu who's also dtim his lecturer in his undergraduate studies e

contained poison have been laid to rest sadly the six child who had been in the ICU at the hospital was reportedly passed away her mother who was part of the MERS attended the funeral service of the five children at n Community Hall in Soo was to rush to the hospital to health facility where the news of her son's passing were broken the moment became even more somber when the passing of the sixth

community members mentioned that they've lost hope because the child who was in hospital that passed away was the lead to solving this case they believe that um the the the police um that are investigating the circumstance surrounding the thirs of the children they would not be able to uncover the truth because the child was a lead to solving this case there seems to be two theories going around about what may have happened one parent had confirmed to you that um their children had indeed bought uh snacks from a local sple shop while another parent uh seems to be pointing fingers at a neighbor what do you know about that yes there different stories we had different stories um some say that the neighbor gave them biscuits gave them money but we know that investig ations are still

fDRZq0Kwr-A,Political analyst Khanyi Magubane weighs in on new mayoral committee,2024-10-13T15:34:25Z,2798,all right well let's get straight into it with political analyst kanyan who joins us live now to weigh in on the newly elected members of the marial committee for the city of Twan kany always a pleasure having you with us good afternoon so let's first start by acknowledging the fact that the newly elected Twan mayor is not stranger to the outgoing da Politics as a former member herself since 2011 until of course her untimely departure in 2021 the da looking like it's seemingly taking a hit here from their former allies um in fact even as actionx a him mashaba himself of course we know is a former member of the democratic Alliance and what we are seeing are changing politic Dynamics in the city of Twan and if we are to analyze the situation politically what's happening in the city of Tuan is actually an indication that what we previously had thought would happen and these are the permeation or the mutations of the gnu into lower levels of government so talking about a government of national Unity of provincial unity and of local Unity across the three spheres of government that is largely what we thought was going to happen uh however Kang is is proving uh that this is not the case you know they are wielding their power certainly the Ain they've put forward n moo and she's no stranger to politics in general she was the deputy mayor uh but she signals a new dawn in in in politics as such not just in the city of Twan this is the first time we're seeing a province actually demanding greater autonomy you know from National to make its own decisions that don't even necessarily reflect those that are at a national level and I think that the amalgamation or the Coalition between the eff actions a and thec of of course highly um criticized by the da but if you listen to what um Party leaders from all three parties are saying they are saying they are turning the tide around they are turning the notion of black dysfunctional leadership around but only time can tell because it was just a year ago CIA sprink was elected as a mayor after several to uh to to to elect a mayor you'll remember those days before selas was um elected that there were many nonstarter attempts so let's see what happens speaking of J out like today's election of members of the mayoral committee which is what our focus is about essentially what is your take on the appointed teams I mean there was much speculation as to who exactly uh within this new alliance in will then get uh witch post as a result of course of this deal which is outside of the gnu so you've heard the names there Albert we took it pretty late but I understand uh it looks like it went pretty much 50/50 uh between andc as well as the as as actions say uh not much around the eff side I mean we we just caught the tail end of that announcement but I did uh hear some eff announcements and actions a so you know no name particularly standing out at this stage but what out for me is the mayor's comments that this is the diverse meril committee that we promised you this is the diverse and culturally attuned and sensitive um Mar committee that we promised you because of course we know that the biggest criticism of the brink Administration in the city of Tuan has been what they've described as a slanted um Advantage towards Suburban areas and affluent areas receiving the best Services of the city and many of lorious townships and outlin areas really suffering to to to get the the attention of the city and also what I think is interesting is the mayor saying that not only are there a diverse uh uh group the meril committee but they're also committed to fighting out corruption she she was saying just to your colleague the other day that all the current corruption cases that are there especially around H water campaign that all of those will not be simply swept under the cage she's Comm committed herself to to continue working in the ethos of actions a which has been to root out corruption at every level how that will sit with their Coalition um Partners I don't think they'll sit too well and sold out to the cause of turning the city of TW around so Kan you now for the city of TW to get back on track in terms of the many challenges that have been highlighted by yourself as well as residents more importantly especially that thorny issue offer Selective Service delivery how important is it then for this relationship and team to work I mean we've heard of the allegations of selective tender processes uh that seem to favor certain people people using their power for self-enrichment and gain even if it's outside of the gnu as we speak about of course the brink Administration and Corruption we understand that the city is actually uh literally on the verge of bankruptcy as well I can believe that I can believe that because that has been one of the biggest indictments towards um the the the local level of government that it's easier to steal at the bottom than it is um to steal at the top because we must remember that South Africa is is is a multisphere government from National provincial um to local and and and in political terms that uh institutional Arrangement is called decentralization and when we decentralize we are devolving in power from the center we are devolving power resources and authority to lower levels of government but that also comes with billions of rents that are devolved to lower levels of government the city of swan controls billions of rents um not just in Revenue but in Equitable share that they receive from government and so for any political party going into power or for any uh people that are close to those resources if they are not ethical if they are not moral as we've seen in the past it is a hanging easy low hanging fruit you know uh how many administrations have uh been placed under Administration for not getting a clean audit because of things like you've mentioned irregular tenders that have been issued so what we need to do is actually start um getting those supply chain movements the pfma all of those acts are there but effectively are they being implemented the municipal Act is there but how effectively is it implemented I think that is what we continue to have a problem with at local government can you beg to a very interesting point of you know what this relationship or Alliance should we call it inani as well as how actually means overall for uh the major Partners within the gnu which is basically thec as well as the da how do you see that relationship going forward we saw uh the political mudslinging that you pointed out as well uh when we began the interview and also maybe I'm sure you also saw the reaction on the day of the the the mayor's election there Freedom front plus really changing their tune and saying that they no longer trust her because as they said it she betray them so actions say and the NC and the eff very proud of this decision very proud indeed and you know that the very interesting dynamics that I think are starting to out if you remember Helen Zill released a statement demanding the reinstatement of selia sprink and within that letter she she writes that the ANC actually needs to whip GP into place because they've gone Rogue and you know they've become a law unto themselves and the ANC needs to continue asserting its Authority and I thought to myself that you know if within the gnu a day where the da would walk away I think from a political point of view the best way to frustrate them would be at a lower level the DA's reaction to the removal of selas brink is anything by we know that there were probably five footsteps away from getting out of the gnu and it makes sense that at a lower level of government that is really where they can frustrate the da because we know that if the actiona and the eff go into the gnu you know the ANC will no longer need the Democratic Alliance and so we know that the ANC has made it very clear to the Democratic Alliance that within the GMU they are not just there to take orders from Helen Zill in the Democratic Alliance and that if she does want to walk away they do have other options of other gnu partners and I think Helen Zill is aware of this and unfortunately the more she plays hard ball the more she wakes or she awakens the militancy of the ANC because the ANC remains a military organization and what has happened in the city of Twan it was a very militant move to kick selia's bring out knowing how it would affect relations at the top but still they went ahead and they took that risk and it's a sign of things to come if my predictions are anything to go by K thank you so much it's always great having a chat with you that is political analyst there kimak kuani and of course the city of tuani electing its council members just a short while ago

fyURGKvbcDE,Tito Mboweni I ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula pays tribute to the late icon.,2024-10-13T15:08:09Z,10184,condolences have been continuing to stream in for former Reserve Bank Governor as well as Minister of Finance Tito Titus boeni according to a statement from the family moeni died at a Johannesburg hospital last night surrounded by loved ones let's now bring in NC Secretary General Mr fig Malala SG balula we thank you so much for according us your time today as we continue to reflect as well as remember one of your own uh whose unexpected passing has sent shock waves across the country and internationally your words of comfort to the people of South Africa his family as well as fellow colleagues like yourselves thank you very much and uh to yourselves and to all the viewers and thank you for having us uh first condolences to the moeni family to his children his brothers the entire family on the passing away of comrade ditto um it is shocking to us we still come into terms with this it happened quick and fast but we saying to them that draw Sol from the knowledge that you are not alone uh the entire nation at large and we in the African National Congress we are poorer today without comrade having shared a political home since the struggle for Liberation tell us more about Mr B's contribution to the ENC as well as ensuring that the organization stood for principles and ethics that sought to liberate our people from the grips of inequality and oppression how was he as a cada a member of the movement we understand at some points he was actually not a popular member due to his very hard stance and opinion on some of the party matters was a uh idite uh loyal member of the African National Congress and our movement at large uh wherever he was deployed uh he did his best and represented the movement very well and he delivered as from 1994 Department of Labor we've got L today because of efforts of comito in implementing the policies of thec he went to the Reserve Bank came back as a minister of finance and we will know him when he he he came in as an architect among others of a fundamental econom EIC policies and the good uh policy reforms that were implemented post 1994 under the stewardship of President MGI and president Mei appointed comr Tito is the first H governor of The Reserve Bank bank Governor number eight and we are very proud of him uh for what he has done for our people for our movement and and uh I dare say that comrade ditto was a revolutionary because he advocated for Progressive change in this country and implemented anc's Progressive policies SG let's talk about those accomplishments even further I mean we understand when he left his official duties within a government he was still very much active in Social engagements and academics and he was an active social media Chef just to show another dimension to his fatherly Persona who love to laugh and make those around him very happy so South Africa has indeed lost a lot in the quality of leadership that Mr boen was yes uh comr Tito was an allrounder even post his cabinet responsibilities he continued to make uh contributions in the multilateral forums uh the African Union and uh you his skills and experience was sought after by many and he was utilized and he served in different boards and all of that uh so he he was generous uh because in terms of his political training he understood that what he have acquired is for the nation and we thank the family for having given us their son uh who served our people and our movement with such a diligence SG now it's still early days of course since the country heard of the sad news but what can you tell us about how the ANC in itself will be making sure that Mr boeni receives a bet befitting send off and where can those who also want to contribute to this do so and any details at this stage whether he will be getting an official uh funeral SG well uh we we will be led by the family uh we we we need to accept and give them time for privacy uh they informed us uh about the his situation when he was admitted at the hospital and then uh he passed away yesterday and then they are still coming to grips meeting everybody and then thereafter they will contact us and then we can only speak about any other matter in relation to the preparations once the family have met decided and give them time and then we'll be able to talk about other details memorial service we will have to ask them uh that we organize such and uh uh we will also hear from the president of the country he was our former Minister former Governor so he does uh deserve a a state funeral um so the president will make a determination about that on our part as thec we would like to celebrate his life was so rich uh and we we can only talk about that once uh we have met with the family formerly the family contacted me um and informed me as the Secretary General on behalf of the NC about this situation I spoke to comr Tito uh two weeks ago and um he was fine you know and honestly this thing uh this death has really uh caught us by surprise you know and shocking uh because um he was just okay and then um the family then contacted us and informed and it was so quick uh whilst we were preparing to go and see him it was over uh they informed us that he was on Live support but they were still hopeful that he will he will he will come he will come all right but it didn't happen and the condolences to to them and once they they have met and regrouped as the and they will inform us about what they have decided and we we just want to give them that time between today tomorrow and maybe Tuesday we can start talking about the preparations as we will be let and we will be informed by them certainly SG I mean it was indeed very sudden the passing of the former uh Governor now SG please don't strangle me on the side note because I have you with me just as we wrap up our interview just your quick response to the details as to why ored babella was actually removed from the party's international relations subcommittee are you able to give us any Clarity or comment uh at this stage yes uh op papela did something that compromised our solidarity work with the people of Western Sahara which the movement entrusted him with a very important position of becoming Deputy to our first DSG in coordinating international relations matters and then for him to overstep and do what he has done it it calls for action and we have acted and I'm not going to talk any further than that we have removed him as a deputy and we have removed him in that Committee of international relations of course his right as a member of the NC will remain but we are taking him to the DC for sure uh he will explain himself there and then his matters will be settled there in the DC we are charging him for contravening thec Constitution and policy uh the days where people do as they wish and uh when they deliberately undermine the cohesion of our movement and discipline are over the NC have instructed the Secretary General to act that's why we called paza to explain himself he did he said he was misrepresented he wases responding to alen Zill I can see the disinformation going around about the people still think that it is the same aenc where they can just sit and promote Anarchy we will not be tolerant to Anarchy in the organization leaders must be leaders if they want to lead uh members must be members members if they want to society to respect thec this looseness in our organization where people just go up and down say things uh on behalf of thec and just say things at random and they are not held accountable it's over we will make them to be accountable we'll follow up on them we've got a mandate and a constitution obligation to run thec properly and to to give everyone a chance if they def political views like Tito will do uh desent is acceptable uh but not Anarchy Anarchy can't be allowed so we we are acting uh uh as it is on this matters including orbert Bella he will explain himself to the DC about what he did we have communicated to all our partners uh abroad and uh we have distanced ourselves from those remarks uh that are associated with thec we've got nothing to do with Morocco we we are fighting for the self-determination and the liberation of the people of Western Sahara up until they are free our president have led the charge in the African Union working with others so no individual can just come and undermine that work of solidarity of the African National Congress uh The Liberation movement simply because they think they can just do things as they wish we are acting thank you very much all right thank you so much SG for that Insight this afternoon that was NC Secretary General there fig balula also weighing in on the passing of former Minister ditto m for

for domestic food security but also for annually boosting agricultural exports sectoral policies must also FOC focus on raising production levels and Export across all Industries with a specific Focus driven by aggressive broad-based industrialization to break the St the strangle hold of historical underdevelopment and economic stagnation through developmental sectoral policies the government must take decisive action to lower the exorbitant cost of communication and transportation this includes sling the price of mobile data and advancing the agent need for an integrated safe reliable and affordable public transport system that serves the working class not just the privileged few for too long industrial policy measures and the funding necessary for industrialization have been sabotaged by fiscal consolidation austerity or budget cuts This Must Be Stopped immediately if South Africa is to break free from the shackles of low National output the industrialization and the crippling levels of unemployment and poverty that devastate the unemployed population of the working class all necessarily all unnecessarily outsourced public sector functions must now be insourced the

reduction of Unemployment uh unemployment and poverty by 20130 the real problem now despite the availability of this model in addition to the constraint associated with the persistent Legacy of colonialism in apartate the impact of the multiple global capitalist crisis and the recent history of corporate and Mafia State capture is the government's choice of austerity hidden behind or executed under the euphemism of fiscal consolidation to confront the problems the SCP will combine mobilizing and developing technical capacity with advancing sustained mobilization building maximum

sustained Beyond this period equally the Central Committee reaffirmed the Sap's Red October message by strongly condemning the recent criminal massacres in the Eastern Cape which claimed 18 lives in luik some of the people were buried from yesterday this attack reflects a broader crisis of lawlessness with communities terrorized by drug drug networks construction mafias extortion gangs and other criminal syndicates decisive action by law enforcement authorities and consistent societal mobilization are essential leaving no stone and tent as part of an integrated effort required simultaneously increasing our total productive forces as rapidly as possible to resolve the unemployment poverty inequality and social reproduction crisis of capitalism on International solidarity and the struggle against imperialism the sap stands family with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for their fundamental right to National self-determination and against the genocide other human rights violations and occupation of their land by the apartate Israel settler regime which the Central Committee strongly condemned Israel must end its occupation of Palestine unconditionally and immediately and it must end the war in the Middle East the leaders of apartate Israeli settler regime must be held accountable for all the genocide and other human rights violation they've committed against the Palestinian people as well as the blatant disregard for the rulings of the international court of justice we reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the imperialist United States backed Israeli settler regime for the systemic genocide ongoing Palestinian human rights violations and illegal occupation of Palestinian land depriving Palestinian people of their statehood in the same vein the Central Committee condemned the Israel settler regimes attacks killings and destructions in Syria in Iran and and currently in Lebanon we pledge solidarity with the entire exist of resistance against

Stand firmly against United States imperialist attempt at undermining their Democratic National sovereignty and destabilizing their respective countries in an anti- and their Anti-Imperialist gains on a said note we end with tribute while in session the Central Committee received the sad news that comrade kin sibia a lifelong South African activist and member of our party and champion of housing rights breathed his last siia who had dedicated much of his life to fighting unscrupulous practices by Banks Court officials and corrupt Insurance practitioners where he recovered many many people's houses as the head of as the leader of the IL human rights Foundation spia stood at the Forefront of Battlers against unjust evictions and unlawful repossessions of Home often sold at auction for a fraction of their value by various Banks spia T efforts bore fruit in significant legal victories such as the 2018 Johannesburg High Court ruling which mandated that repossessed homes cannot be auctioned without a reserve price this means when the banks sell the houses they must take what is due to them and give the remainder to the owner of the house the banks over the years have been taking this money for themselves in fact we require investigation into this thing so that the banks must account for practically defrauding homeowners that they they they sold their houses the Judgment this judgment was a hardfought victory that sought to prevent the abusive abusive banking practices that had allowed properties to be sold for as little as 10 rent devastating homeowners particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds and communities equally another message of cons condolences goes to the family of com Tito boeni and to the ANC during our Central committee meeting we received the S news of the passing on or the death of comrade Tito boen and we sent our heartfelt condolences to him and his family and the broader Liberation movement on this great loss encountered comen the former ANC national executive committee member will be remembered for his significant contribution to The Liberation struggle for leading the development of progressive labor legislation as South Africa's first minister of Labor following our hardw April 1994 Democratic breakthrough lastly the Central Committee extend its sincere condolences to one of our members Central Committee members comr chup liaba who's also the deputy minister of land land reform and rural development and to the entire mataba family for the tragic loss in counted on the final day today of our plenary we received the heartbreaking news that matatas mother may Grace Matata breathe her last today this is the end of the Central Committee statement thank you very much thank you very much let me take questions you the first one you can proceed free thank you I'm to okay it's fine I'm you can hear okay my first question is you spening about the reconfiguration of the alliance from outside uh and you're talking about a broad alliance with the left leaning organizations does that include looking possibly at compacting with um parties in the Progressive caucus for instance like the MK and the e possibility that's my first question my second one is that am I correct in my understanding that you're saying that thec under presidenta is right wing and if that is the case by implication it would be taking it would take a kind of austerity stance towards a government spending so your suggestion that you want State investment expansion of um of uh public employment the big to be instituted how going to happen if you actually understand that you're actually dealing with a right wi government that's the second one my third one is have you been invited to attend thec 100 days in the gnu celebrations tomorrow at uly house will you be honoring that um particular invitation my last one is you have spoken about um Mr Tito but how do you see his legacy um from a working class and um poor people of South Africa perspective in terms of him as the Reserve Bank and the fin finance minister of South Africa um from eyewitness um just one question for me I think it builds on what my colleague has asked about the configuration um you mentioned that uh you mentioned something about elections I don't know just want a bit of clarity um are you not ruling out that um in part of um this mobilization mobilization against the GMU that you might also look at contesting elections thank you thank you cheers and any wants to take first no you we'll be by you okay no thank you very much thank you very much uh the the several questions certainly about building a popular movement H socialist movement of the workers and the poor um it's a process that we' have already began to do in our communities in the townships uh in villages we have already began to do that um working to respond to the untenable living conditions of the poor uh particularly in the field of uh food Security in the field of Agriculture uh we have started some extensive work there um and in that regard we have found some of the exciting members of community some organized some in an organized form and we are also helping to organize them in that space so it doesn't necessarily specify which organization we will engage with I can say yes uh in the context of uh a general anti-austerity movement we will work with all forces that will fight NE liberalism for instance and budget cuts that are denying our people basic services and even Economic Development so in that regard we don't necessarily rule out what kind of organization in a particular Community our comrades will work with um as per the particular members that we have organization that we have we have mentioned we have not had engagements uh with them when we were negotiating the possibility of a minority government option we had failed we could engage with the eff and we started the process of Engagement in that regard but as you know the minority government it didn't happen and we also discussed a wide range of other issues in that regard but it was in the context of establishing a new government so that we don't have to work with the neoliberal forces of The Da and the freedom front uh and we also in that space By the way indicated that we also did not want to work with forces of State capture that may be represented by the MK party so going forward we will engage uh things on the basis of programmatic issues on the ground um the reconfiguration of the alliance um The Alliance reconfiguration process has taken too long and it has led us to this uh trap where we are as a movement the arrogance sometimes of uh certain leaders particularly in thec who act on our behalf without us uh that kind of an approach our Central Committee was very clear should no longer be accepted of course in the context of uh engagements that we have have taken place you'll know that uh in 2019 the entire Alliance political Council that included some of the leadership of the current leadership of the ANC in the top seven adopted a framework of a reconfigured Alliance document a joint document but last year the NC developed their own document and taking us back and even expressing things that uh we did not necessarily say as a Communist party for instance that um uh reconfiguration will liquidate the African National Congress completely uh irrelevant that particular process that process seeks to strengthen the capacity of the Revolutionary forces headed by the African National Congress on the 100 days of the gnu celebrations tomorrow we have rejected the invitation we will not be going albe it it's it's it's been laay together with h thanking the people who voted for the African National Congress for which we in the campaign it feels sad but we will not be going as a Communist party and therefore on com Tito boeni we think all our comrades Tito and other comrades must be respected for their unwavering fight for National Liberation of our country in the struggle against apartate and against imperialism and against colonialism D was one of those who lost his Youth and to go and embark on an on a struggle to fight against the aparate regime and of course when he became minister of Labor he led the progressive introduction of uh labor loss in our country that workers still today still enjoy we appreciate that and we've been on record as well that when he was Minister of Finance even when we have had differences with him but they were and was one of the most honest comrades if he didn't agree with something he tells you on the spot here I don't agree and we sit down and debate that was his nature and we want to extend our condolences once more to his family and the entire Liberation movement as a whole the issue regarding uh that aspect uh on the uh participation in the elections we have never ruled this option out it has always been in there uh as you know in our last augmented Central Committee last year around April we took a decision that given the counterrevolutionary threat posed to the National Democratic Revolution to our movement the counterrevolutionary threats largely coming from International Capital working with Monopoly Capital here in South Africa and which we expressed clearly of uh the the the capitalist forces that have funded other parties and created even new parties just so that they can contest the African National Congress and the I political party funding of this year's last third and fourth quarter gives you full indication of who funded who in the political space to actually oppose the Liberation movement to that extent we took a position that we will still be with the African National Congress in this campaign the 20 2024 General elections that's what happened but we are still engaging in this process as the Communist party going forward uh on the on the question around whether why do we believe that how do we believe that the left leaning policies are going to be Implement implemented successfully by the GN you want to say categorically clear that um we believe that the gnu Arrangement has minimized the capacity of the of the state to be able to implement policy I mean the left leaning policies but well thec believe that it can so what we're doing ourself now we're saying we are we will have to force thec to ensure that it happens at it pro promises but we don't believe that the whole limitations the limitations there I actually I'm string it from doing so and that's why we're feeling that um the best way that they would have taken they should have taken a lean left leaning Poli taking a minority governance government with some national um Unity um features that would have assisted them to be free in terms of implementing left leaning policies that will allow them to move a little bit faster than the 30 years that we've been thank you thank you very much uh do we have followups in the absence of followups and noting the pressure and right may you allow me to close the session agre colleagues thank you so much and to file well no thank you very much guys thank you thank you

are the family started off by going to the crime scene and collected the spirit of Mama as would understand that it is within the cultural South African culture African culture to make sure that the spirit of the Dead is collected from the sin so that it doesn't maybe H continue to bring bad luck within the family within the Village or bring back bring the bad Omen to their family but now I'm joined by women from this particular Village who always experience all such bad criminality that continues to haunt the villagers at as a whole to be specific m for Poli for for yeah thank you very much um saying that they are terrorized in these Villages and was in the rural Villages of luiki they cannot sleep peacefully at night because these dos would come and kick their doors and even children at some times they are being raped they are beaten up by criminals and women and children espe young women are raped school schoolo children are also victimized by criminals in this Village and then she's asking government to do something maybe a a police station can make a huge difference in the village ofana to be specific because she's saying that crime has been terrorizing this Village in each and every year there are people that are being killed there are people that are being raped but now let me just talk to one of the mothers who who's also saying that really something needs to be done in making sure that CRI criminality and crime in the rural Villages is dealt with Mama what are the issues that you think need to be addressed first of all how do you feel about the brutal killing of women H first of all let me greet you in the name of Jesus Christ amen my name is Nuno staying at Gula Village but at this time I don't know who's going to be killed again because here at everywhere we are not safe at all I'm staying I'm a mother who's staying alone all my children are staying at Cape Town my grandchildren are staying at Cape Town there's no one to look after me so even if if if a dog is shaking at the door I used to think maybe it's it's it's a para I I don't know how to call our children because this is done by our children so I'm asking government to put maybe a Mobile police station which is going to Bean Anda in the in the center so must where to run because sometimes we don't even have the money to go to the police station where we can even walk if it's if the Mobile police station is between goana and gratula that will be much better and we're asking government to intervene this is serious today we are bearing the last woman of South

kOBjlENbQCQ,Tito Mboweni |  Deputy Finance Minister David Masondo pays tribute to the late icon,2024-10-13T13:05:25Z,5350,well we're very pleased to be joined here in Studio by Deputy Minister of Finance Mr David masondo as we of course continue to pay tribute and remember uh the late Governor did bini's contribution in totality uh to South Africa Deputy Minister thank you so much for joining us on such a sad note though uh welcome to ESS today so what was your reaction when you first heard the news of the passing of the former Governor no thanks uh Alicia and and good afternoon to your viewers it has very sad I got the news uh last night I couldn't believe it I thought Am I Dreaming what's going on here and then the second family member called and I said indeed he's no more but let me take this opportunity also to convey uh my condolences to the boeni family uh his friends and to South Africa because indeed it's not only a loss to the Moen Family it's a loss to the world Deputy Minister now you obviously have a history of working very closely um with Mr bweni as as as as your department head there talk to us about your professional relationship how was he how was he at the HM of managing everybody in the office in terms of his Persona in terms of his professionalism talk to us about that you know Al I was very fortunate that he it was beyond the professional relationship I mean he was my leader and uh he was writing a memo uh of his own yes and he said David can you give your your your comment your feedback on what what I have written and unfortunately it's not yet published and um of course the family the the property now belongs to the family we've got to have a conversation with the family on how that memo should be uh published and be shared with the public because there's a lot there that South Africans uh should know but working with him was a great honor very very honest um leader and he had no rank Consciousness he didn't care whether you are at that rank in the um treasury he listened to your logic and uh he will debate with us and and and and I think he led also in a very very difficult time during covid when the economy took a big dip and our Revenue also went uh down significantly but even under those conditions he said it's important for us to make sure that um our debt levels uh at the right level and for him the issue about debt was not an issue we can borrow but he always ask can the economy afford to service that debt the tough question and what are you borrowing for and as you know he was very critical of the government borrowing to recapitalize s soes that we're not performing well and also posing a systemic risk to the economy like uh escom uh like SAA uh transnet he was very very critical of that in his in his view the S soes has a very important role to play but they need to be manage properly so that they don't become a burden uh on the fiscal it was very uh very tough on S soes uh so that we keep our debt levels at the right level so it was always cracking the whip when it was time there Deputy Minister you talk about how we navigated the country uh through of course Co times but I mean let's look back at the 20072 2008 uh financial crisis we understand he contributed immensely uh to the financial sector in the country by steering uh the country through that Tetris terrain as you said say there he really really was critical of uh of overspending and and spending that didn't amount to any any any productive uh use and measures yeah so at that time as a Reserve Bank Governor I think he was concerned about inflation that if the prices of goods uh in the economy goods and services go up um it means that your purchasing power gets eroded with prices going up it means your money can only buy a few things so he set up um the inflation targeting uh to make sure that uh we protect the poor as well because if the prices are up and the poor can't buy bread they can't buy their Necessities uh they will Stu poverty will Deen but if our prices are very high we can also compete uh with the world when we're producing things here and if they become too expensive it means we won't be able to sell them in the global market and if we fail to sell it means that uh companies won't be making profits and the consequences are quite uh so he was very uh concerned about the the inflation but also for the on the stability of the financial sector um that is why he was also quite Central in into introducing what we call the Twin Peak system in which we have the conduct Authority Under the financial sector conduct Authority as we have it today responsible for protecting me and you against the conduct of banks insurance companies but also the presedential uh Authority which is responsible for making sure that uh the money that you deposit you'll definitely get it the banks ought to have certain uh Capital adequacy ratio so that when you're looking for your money at least you'll have it so it was very Central in making sure that on the conduct side but also on the credential side our financial sector it's intact Deputy minister in closing I mean what lessons um um have you have you learned from him and have also assimilated into your role as you continue serving as Deputy minister in the in the in the financial department let's talk about that and also I mean we understand that uh he still contributed immensely to society even after he departed from his official duties uh in Parliament we understand many well-known Scholars have held him as an exceptional Mentor who went above his Call of Duty to assist others and was a selfless individual the the only thing I didn't learn from him is cooking I I don't think his cooking was that good but he will always say the problem it's not my cooking it's your test Parts I said no no no your cooking is it's is really really H not but um um he he really insisted that any policy position that you put it out there it must be properly researched and uh young people need to be interested in education because you can only lead better if you understand how things work how the economy Works how politics work uh how the world Works in general whether South Africa or globally and he really really insisted he will give you things to read and you say here's a book let's have a conversation tomorrow and he was very very um a good Mentor and he mentored through insisting on reading and he would say no if you haven't read this I'm not going to have a conversation with you you had to read first and then you had a go I really learned a lot about about um rigor in the work that you do uh in order to avoid rhetoric and slogans he was very dismissive of of slogans he he took intellectual work very serious and it's not by accident that Mandela also picked him up into his cabinet because right in the mid 80s he was studying economics contributing to the anc's economic policy views through the labor yes he was very critical of in in the policy Economic Policy formulation the ready to govern document that we had which was the policy document by thec he was very Central in that and the recent one was the economic strategy that National treasury uh adopted and in that policy document he said it's important for us to open up the energy Market to ensure that it's not escom that provide electricity but other private sectors uh private companies that are interested in generating energ let's have them there I mean we got 200 and something days without load shedding dieni has a huge um um contribution towards that by allowing different um private sector people to generate energy so that we don't only rely on on on ascom and that is had a huge contribution in reducing the demand on escom whilst escom itself played a major role in sorting out its uh Cal power performance so he he really really so his legacy uh we are feeling it today um and it's a legacy that doesn't start um when he a governor when is the Minister of Labor or a minister of finance it start way back when he took a decision and then said I'm going to fight for Liberation in this country and speaking of Liberation I mean the current government makeup of the government of national Unity what can you tell us about some of his contributions there uh that have led to you know some of the policies that he might have drafted actually being part of the new Administration so one of the um key things in the government of national Unity statement of intent is the structural reforms which is about um dealing with the supply side constraint on our economy I've just spoken about supply of electricity Freight Logistics telecommunications scales wateren conceptualized that and he said in order for us to grow the economy it's important that we deal with this supply side constraint and the government of national Unity has adopted the program which we call the structural reform under operation vinda it's run by national Treasury under the leadership of President Siri Raposa so the gnu will be carrying out that program which has been conceptualized um by um Tito b m very quick one Minister I know you started by extending your condolences to the family but as of course a former aada and comrade as you served in the same party with him your parting words once again uh to his industry colleagues to thec and of course to the family one more time very quickly let's build on his legacy we don't have freedom yet we've got better conditions for us to continue the struggle for freedom in South Africa and the world may the soul of dieni rest in peace and we shall be forever grateful to his contributions to South Africa and the world Deputy Minister great having you with us in studio thank you so much that is Deputy Minister of Finance uh Mr David Mond in studio here with us also uh just sharing some of his sentiments on the passing of the former Reserve Bank Governor d

GMtFvNbChBU,"Tito Mboweni| ""He was a revolutionary who sacrificed his life for SA's liberation"": Mbhazima Shilowa",2024-10-13T12:14:24Z,3470,now to talk further about tieni we are joined by former Ken Premier basima Shila Mr Shila good afternoon and thank you so much for being with us today h good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity how would you describe the late Tito Moen as you reflect on on this Sunday afternoon uh like all human beings have got different tra and attributes that one can always look at so I think it is not easy to Define anyone in one single uh narrative it's true as many would say he was a a revolutionary someone who sacrificed his life in his own country and go and go abroad leaving panuna high and you know to fight for for the Liv Liberation when he came back H imers himself in the work at thec Department of Economic and planning but also once given an opportunity by President Mandela uh to become the minister of Labor he put in place what you can only call both transformative and revolutionary um labor laws which up to today remains uh strong and relevant and I'm sure many workers for many years to come will enjoy them the Labor Relations Act the basic conditions of Employment Act health and safety in the minds occupational healthy skills development in which there's now also a skills Development Fund and employment Equity at the same time as a minister of uh of Finance ER I mean or more as a as the head of the Reserve Bank it was at a time when you needed to make some stabilization of which he would have done well some of us may disagree may have disagreed with him in how he stuck steadfastly to inflation targeting but I always held a view that that is not his position as Governor the government decide on what need to be to be done and finally Tito was one of those people who you know chose to live among his own people it may not be that in zanin he was in a village H but he was always closer to the area of zanin was always at his own village otherwise known as as bordo and he was a man of a a great uh Integrity but finally to also say that you know Tito didn't suffer fools easily so you know he wouldn't dismiss anyone but he would engage but unless you convince him he would not switch over to your side let me take you back to to 1994 he was among the first crop as you said of people picked by Nelson Mandela to be part of of that first cabinet in 1994 did he see something special in the man back then well uh let me say this because I think it's a known fact PTO was not Mandela's first choice for minister of Labor Mandela's choice of minister of labor was J NAU in a consultation that we had with myself and John goo and L and later on a telephone call with President Mandela we said to him no we would prefer that J do rather be a minister in the presidency without portfolio responsible for the RDP and but that would suggest tieni as the minister of of Labor and that inspired choice I don't think any worker would regret because as soon as he was appointed he really came in there there were many battles that he he fought together with us around the lockout Clause around progressive labor relations collective bargaining and all of those so obviously the decision to appoint in the end was that of President Mandela but we we made a recommendation and I think uh you know uh what is there to be seen of what he was able to do okay you mentioned this earlier you went on to hold more influential positions after that like the Finance Minister The Reserve Bank Governor how did his leadership help shape the country's economic environment at the time I think you know it depends where where one is coming from if you look at the fact that in where inflation was at the time I think um you know the whole issue of trying to hold inflation Bringing Down the debt and other things it would have done well but of course you know uh caring inflation sometimes by Rising by raising interest rates does have an impact on on ordinary men and women because it increases that for those who who have to to to borrow so in that sense there would have been disagreement there would also have been disagreement in that uh the whole issue of the do focus on the macroeconomic policy at the time without any changes even as circumstances showed some of it were not working was something which from a worker point of view we felt something better could have been done but again as I said you know our anger could best be taken with the with a government than with the Reserve Bank let's talk a bit about his politics internally within thec uh would you say he had a lot of influence that he was member of the the national executive committee and the national working committee at some point uh I'm sure he was a he was an influential member I mean he held the different positions I think very few could match him in terms of understanding a policy especially Economic Policy since he would have been um involved in it drafting with people like Max culu Trevor Trevor Manuel and and others so I'm sure he he would be able to hold those I had the pleasure of meeting him from from time to time and and our last uh lunch was on the 8th of uh of of August uh I mean of September sorry and and in that one you could still see that you know he was pained with what had happened to thec his loss of power but he understood that the masses are not wrong that is therefore not the people or the voters who were wrong is that the needed to make changes if it wanted to retain or to regain its position in society did he cook that lunch himself no there are some things which me and him never agreed upon and that is U you know foodwise I know he regarded himself as a food fundi and culinary but mine extend to sort of more like you know a whole case of of garlic a case of tomato and lots of chili I don't think my stomach would be able to handle that okay let's let's move back to to to the last thing he did basically how how important was his comeback in a way as Finance Minister now during the the sixth Administration I think it was important that they brought someone that you know society thec and the market could bring in but we have to understand that he was a reluctant uh minister of Labor because I think he hadn't retired he had taken a view that look uh others must be able to lead but I think when the call came H he was ready to serve but at the same time once he felt that look I'm sure the ANC may be ready to find someone he went to to the president and said please I would want you to to find someone else but he didn't just leave because and I know in discussion I I had with him that even though he had a discussion with the president h 9 months earlier the president had said look wait until I am ready and he didn't say to the president well I'm leaving next week he stayed on until the president said look I think I now have found someone and then we'll be able to work and move forward so it was important it was at the time of um of Co you needed someone um you know that could come in there and when he came back he raised issues that he had also been raising when he was uh in retirement the issue of um the issue of a state bank I think it's something that he believed in and and I hope that H you know people continue to look at things like that and yeah and so I think you know it was a life well lived short lived as it is but we don't live forever what is important is that you leave a legacy behind and I've got no doubt that while some may disagree in the main he left a great legacy in our country okay thank you so much for joining us here this afternoon that was the former Hing premier maima shilowa for
OE6loIFEzu0,"Tito Mboweni | ""Nedlac Act, RDP all came from his insights to make democracy real"" : Trevor Manuel",2024-10-13T11:10:13Z,2354,let's move you to this now condolences are pouring in for former Reserve Bank governor and Minister of Finance dto Titus syeni now we also speak to former Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel on the passing of Mr moeni thank you so much Mr Manuel for your time let's get your immediate reaction to the news of the passing of the former Minister moeni thank you very muchi and good morning to all your viewers uh of course the passing of uh my friend and comrade TI buen um uh so suddenly uh is a is a is a deep loss uh Tito was always a very special human being uh throughout all the years from the way in which he embraced me when I first came to Shell House as thec headquarters and was as the head of the Department of Economic planning through our uh joint efforts in a number of efforts and the people frequently talk about him as as Governor but I think that the groundwork was laid much before that uh Tito's insights into what went into ready to govern the Reconstruction development plan all preceding uh our our our election into government in 1994 and then I think that uh what we need to acknowledge is the role that he played in in labeling legislation that benefits lives of working people to this day the basic conditions of Employment Act the Labor Relations Act the employment Equity act and then also the establishment of nedlac uh the nedlac act all of those came from the hands and minds of Tito bweni and was focused on improving on the quality of life of people to make democracy real in the lives of people all of that preceded his tenure as as governor of The the Reserve Bank and sometimes you don't quite see uh what the governor does in quite the same way but Tito's battle to ensure that we could both attract investment into the country and keep uh interest rates low in the interest of of dealing with with the debt of people uh the protection of the banks in South Africa all of those uh were phenomenally important uh contributions That Tito made to laying the basis for a better life for all in South Africa it's a long story it's a long journey uh but I think it's one that we must cherish because his contribution has left an indelible Mark in in all of our lives uh one of the issues that hasn't been spoken about in poliy is his deep passion for the African continent uh TI B was part of the uh institutional reform panel for the African Union um which was shared by by um president Paul kagami of Rwanda Tito often tweeted about just how good he found things in Rhonda but was about understanding the need for institutional reform on the African continent and was a deep deep part of his life uh deep part of his commitment and his frequent travels to Kigali was an expression of of that body of work as well and then he comes back as Minister of Finance later so it's a long journey uh and I think a very sad loss uh he hadn't been uh ill for very long uh it was a very sudden departure uh and I think it deeply deeply felt loss indeed Mr Manuel and I want to also just piggy back off your response there you know as you spoke to us about your relationship with Mr moeni that spans many years and the reality is behind that man who crunched numbers and formulated policy was also quite a humorous character and I I want to hear about that character from you look there were there are so there are twoo many too many stories to tell uh but uh Tito's humor uh was was a stuff of Legend whether this come from from stories from Exile about how useless he was going to be as a gorilla he was much better as an economist in the guilla to some of the quirks because he was quite a quirky chap uh I I know that that many people relate to his quirkiness uh uh from his life in M uh and and uh he cooking um which of which he he told stories uh and and and and clips on on X or Twitter uh uh but all of it is is is is part of this this wonderfully humorous uh engaging and embracing kind of person you know one of the things I I I I I always remember about Tito is that he lived a life of complete non-racialism he didn't see racing people uh he always embraced other people whether this be tomato Farmers uh uh in lopo somewhere or the poorest of people in in an informal settlement elsewhere Tito was the kind of person whose humor also saw him embracing others uh and and that you know he's just a great person Great South African uh and a great leader of people and Mr Manuel he also been described as a decisive leader as we continue to hear tributes pouring in throughout the course of the morning and I can assume that also part of his job was also making decisions that were you know viewed as unpopular by some fronts so he was a decisive leader talk to us about him being a decisive leader and some of his legacy policies as well as programs that he implemented look I I I refer to the piece of legislation that go back to um henia as as minister of uh Labor uh and all of them were driven in quite a hard way when you say decisive it's also important to say That Tito was an inclusive leader um he he would take the Trade union leaders into um a hotel for a week and sit with them virtually through day and night to get those key pieces of legislation uh basic additions of Employment Act Labor Relations Act across the line um and and he knew that if the union leaders were onside with the legislation then getting it through Parliament was always going to be easy uh and and so when you say decisive it wasn't about shutting himself off and taking decisions it was often about the way in which he reached out and brought other people uh on board um so so that was always a part it it was part of his character part of his style uh and uh uh that that decisiveness uh carried him uh you know from from the labor Ministry into into the position of governor of The Reserve Bank um and and also the way in which he he had to play a role uh in in global institutions World Bank the IMF uh uh the G20 all of those required sharp insights and the ability to persuade and decide and mrem Manuel this is of course a man that was the first black governor for the country in 1999 going into 2009 and this is when the country was still transitioning talk to us about this and what it actually meant for him he probably shared it with you at some point police let me say that uh we we shouldn't make too much of uh the color of his skin in becoming governor of The Reserve Bank you can also say it was the first black minister of Labor uh he was the first black this that or the other uh I I don't think that we must overemphasize the race because I'm saying that one of Tito standout attributes was his non-racialism he went into the Reserve Bank uh initially as as as an advisor to the former Governor Dr Chris thals and by the time he became governor in 2009 uh the groundwork has been had been very well prepared so there wasn't a a big Ruckus about it um but of course Tito had had his own style and uh for instance he would not uh meet editors for dinner uh editors of of of newspapers for dinner unless they wore a black tie it was a a Qui it was a a funny thing uh the editors were always muffed because they'd have to go on higher tuxedos to have dinner with the governor but that was Tito he was he was quite extraordinary in the way in which he said about things and Mr Manuel before we let you go let's just hear about the Legacy that he leaves behind look I touched on those key pieces of legislation I touched on before we got into government um the the um ready to govern a program uh the Reconstruction development program but all of that was part of the preparation for governance uh and and I think that that Legacy is a durable Legacy the the issues in the Reserve Bank uh are transformative but they're a little more difficult because interest rates change and so on but in respect of the building of a strong banking uh system that'll that'll outlift Tito as part of his legacy um he's he's ten in the in the private sector where he was chair of both angral lanti and and naac for for a considerable period and of course he was also an advisor to the International Investment Bank Goldman Sachs right until until the very end he he retained that and when he left to be come Minister of Finance he returned to to that position certainly uh all of that will live on and his contributions to the African continent and to institutional reform on the continent I think are also legendary in in understanding ourselves as South Africans but also as Africans and knowing that we must have appropriate institutions to improve on the lives of our people right that's former Minister of Finance Mr Trevor Manuel joining us there thank you very much indeed for your time on the program and as tributes continue to pour in we now speak with Matthew Parks who's Catu parliamentary coordinator regarding the passing of former Finance Minister diten this is two acknowledge Bo significant contributions to the country's economic landscape and I know that um as we continue to also get tributes this will also go on into the day with our colleagues who will be carrying it forward
MVCgvkXw7Lk,Moshito Music Conference | Unveiling 2024 theme and ambassadors,2024-10-13T10:18:31Z,451,now since 2004 moshito music conference and exhibition has established itself as Africa's Premier music industry event with the purpose to broaden the business of intelligence of Music Industry professionals and this is for the entire African continent strengthen business networks for participants now moshito celebrates 21 years this year and will be launching this year's theme and ambassadors tomorrow in santon mashito 2024 promises to inspire connect and celebrate the Innovative power of African music on the global stage for more on this now we're joined in Studio by Stanley Co I was chairperson of mashito Music Conference and exhibition thank you so much for your time on the program the pleasure is mine it's great to be here but when I'm listening to you reading that I'm like wow yeah we're doing bigger things yeah so it makes you also reflect on just how far you've come right no no it's on the serious note it's a great reflection uh for myself as a chair but also for the entire music industry value chain and of course the partners and stakeholders of mashito that have propelled mush to become a global conference um and happening every year on annual basis and making sure that we create solid platform to educate people about the business of music to create platforms for people to understand themsel the issues of Conduct in the sector the issue of contract in the sector as well as create some of the best platforms because we've got about six events that we curate during musito and those events create platforms for South African artist to perform yeah and just how helpful is this platform for musician and I ask you this question because just off air men andu we're having this conversation that there's absolutely no excuse for artists not to be in the know not to know how to handle things now when it comes to the business front just how handy is this entire conference for artists look it it has been one of the greatest source of inspiration for the African continent but also locally it has transformed the lives of so many artist I mean if we reflect back with the likes of Mak being an ambassador at mhu Big Zulu but apart from that it has educated a whole lot of people that are running their own independent successful businesses today from record companies to just Independent Artists that comes and lears at mush we have pled a lot of artist not only in local events but also in global events we've taken artists to countries such as macius DOA Uganda and of course abroad so at michito is a onstop platform where you come and learn Empower yourself with the knowledge and the skills you need to run your business but more than anything where you get to network with the people who are making it in the business you can imagine the likes of joy of J Standard Bank Joy of Ja event curators comes to musito your drunkens Festival comes to Mush all the promoters from maku and many other events comes to musito that's where artist gets to be blocked and of course we've learned to realize the power of mhit it does not only introduces people as newcomers but it gives them in platform to present themselves the way they want and Stelly just how important is that element of having all these artists Under One Roof having these artists being in a position to also Network yeah look at the most important thing cuz I guess the music business always boils down to understanding of the business itself without understanding and education many people always cry foul and of course this year we are appealing that our a class artist must come to the conference cuz some of them still need to be equipped with the skills necessary then all the upcomings that are entering into the industry come to Mish got programs to accommodate everyone including government MH is not a platform where you only talk to a bunch of Select you you're talking to the whole industry value chain from an upcoming artist to someone who's at Prime level because there's things like investment planning that are critical for any artist in the business so we always make sure that when you create the business as a the the project as a board we always want to identify gaps of problems that are encountered by people in the sector and we make sure that we give them the space to come and learn and at least uplift themselves in so far as any challenges they may have weakness is on so mhit empowers everyone with the necessary skills that you need to make it and thrive in this business be it as a as as an artist be it as a manager be it as a stakeholder or an investor or at any capacity as long as you're within the trade we've got everything that covers you and I want us to also touch on your theme this year's theme and how it actually speaks to or reflects the current music landscape on the African continent because I mean you're just over two decades old and that's no Child's Play yeah no it's it's not and of course I must give credit to the board and to the staff we have consistently from day one made sure that mush curate some of the best programs but if you look at our theme for 2024 uh we are celebrating 30 years of democracy and we just wanted to understand what was the role of Music in the Democracy that we have attained and tomorrow as we unveil and unbundle the we have for the masses the International Community that will be coming to musito that's one of the key thing that will be taking joy in unveiling what will democracy be without music so you can pause all TV shows pause all movies pause the sounds and tell me what will does be without music and let's hear from you about the ambassadors because I understand you're also unveiling some ambassadors what went into the selection of those ambassadors and how what value they'll be adding to this conference and some of the conversations that will be had so look annually for the past couple of years mus has always selected a range of of of of ambassadors usually a legend and a young upcoming artist who's doing well so we pair them both and of course we acquir the rights to have them as our ambassadors and then they also perform cuz these are people that are active within the music business so the selection of this year's ambassadors was a gring process uh we always have a list of about 10 to 12 names and then we need to select based on who do we think will sit well or jail well with the theme for that particular year taking into account the youness of the program as well as the legendary reflection of the program so this year we have selected two of the best representative of the historic balance of the de years that we have gone through as a country and I want us to talk about your hopes your dreams your aspirations as well for of course moshito just moving forward and how you see it also playing a role in the global stage and taking African music to the global stage yeah I think the next goal uh for me as a chair and of course for us as a board uh it's to make sure that misho remains one of the biggest uncontested International Music Festival uh and the conference that creates more opportunities for artists to learn and to continue to perform but more than to sign as many reciprocal agreements with like-minded countries that wants to participate in as growing Africa together and as well as making sure that Africa competes with the greatest talents that we have we currently are leading number one worldwide in terms of sounds um the influence ofano as well shows that so for me as a CH to make sure that mashito continues to grow and to continue to attract like-minded sponsors that supports the vision so that we can have qu event rather than having a weekly event at a particular period of a year so we want to keep the office running throughout and to make sure that we Cate some of the best opportunities for our talents in the country and if we do so we'll be a providing relief for distress people will get to work then we can alleviate some of the challenges and people dying pop us listen standing cause a chairperson of the mush music conference and exhibition thank you so much for your time on the agenda today and we wish you all the best no it's a pleasure and thank you for having us we'll see the public tomorrow in s where we launching and unveiling the country's biggest program all right and we leave a cheer for now
TeVUQcYQNEM,Solidarity March | Many countries supported SA's oppressed people during the struggle: Lesufi,2024-10-13T10:15:26Z,2948,"Sophi why is it important to be here today three things quickly the first one obviously we comma in the set anniversary of U when people were killed in palestin and we really feel that it can be a day that can just pass without being observed in our country you know if you lose almost 42,000 lives it's an indication that something is not right but secondly is to continue our solidarity work with the people of Palestine and we must not get tired uh to really demonstrate our love to demonstrate our care and to demonstrate our willingness uh to end the war thirdly which is crucial to us we are quite aware that the country is preparing necessary papers to also highlight this particular matter and ventilate it in appropriate forums but also to mobilize other countries that this is no longer a case of South Africa alone it's a case of the world and the world must join us and our presence here today is just to cement to maintain and always uh sharing the message of solidarity with the people of palestin thec has been very supportive but uh we saw some criticism that uh you tend to focus on this matter and perhaps that could have contributed to the performance of The Province in terms of allegiance to the plight of the citizens of how thing people say saying that you are just wasting time with this cause we're prepared to pay any price we have paid big prices on this matter that is why even today uh we are requesting people to sign uh the petition to rename uh sentent drive so that we can show a peace that is available to us we can rename it uh to remind all of us that indeed we are part of the global world we can't be excited when people rename their streets after Nelson Mandela you go literally to every country country there will be a name Nelson Mandela but we can't do that we can also be proud and be selfish because our freedom was a a product of solidarity our freedom was a product of coexistence with other countries our freedom and our constitution was a product of other countries that Shar their best idea so to isolate International solidarity and want us to be selfish to say we need to focus our internal problems and leave the world when the world liberated us be selfish and that I think it will demonstrate how we are failing to be part of the International Community there is no country that can survive alone and those that are criticizing us about supporting Palestine forget that we are making business transaction with many countries why are they not criticizing us is business much more bad means more better relationship than solidarity with people that have been killed and Meed literally every every day so we're proud of this and we're prepared to pay any price if we paid this price during elections or we pay this price at any particular moment we will stand with the weak and the vulnerable and we are unshakeable on that particular position and we want to say to the people of Palestine hold on hold on freedom is coming they will celebrate like we celebrated because even our freedom people never thought it will come it came and the freedom of the people of Palestine will also come and will join them in that celebration but we are not cowards we don't want to join when we celebrate we want to join even there is pain and misery so that people can understand that we are true friends in good and Bs and finally uh the we are in you have been playing a prominent role to ensure that you have a new mayor now the road ahead in terms of appointment of mmc's tomorrow at 4:00 where the executive mayor will be announcing the committee we had discussion with our alliance Partners we had discussion also with those political parties that agree with us today uh fortunately we have all agreed that we will share the positions that are available there not for purpose of uh any other thing but for purpose of advancing Service delivery we needed people with skills people that are ready who are not going to say I'm still learning because we've got only 18 months to the next election so by tomorrow this time uh South Africans will know the leadership that will be run in that municipality for thec how many well because the negotiations are at an advanced stage we don't want to really be seen to be bullying other political parties uh all political parties will be represented I think that's the best answer I can give to you and finally on your government in howting the how you have constituted your government and how you arrived at that it was quite a difficult road but 100 days almost how do you feel do you think you took a right decision by just going minority government Coalition by their own definition are fluent uh they can change at any time at any moment what you need is respect what you need is it a coalition or minority government it's a people's government we call it Hing government of provincial Unity on the basis that when you pass the budget it's only one political party of the seven political parties that didn't support us so all other political parties are supporting us they might have reservation there and then one or two items but what do we have on this 100 days our enemies and those that are opposed to us they never thought we'll arrive at this point so we are here no regrets no regrets at all no regrets at all but the door is still open whoever wants to work with us we want to work with them and the reports that the da might push you to consider some of the Met TR for example which political party da which party is that one the da that is in in the government of national Unity with thec at National level there are reports that we are likely to see them coming in in Aur the is not a branch of the NC I don't know that organization and Helen Zill is not a member of the NC and the D must be told it can't dictate terms to us purely because of the color of their skin where we stand we work with those that will respect us we work with those that will understand us and we work with those that understand the International solidarity that we embarking on if they're not agreeing with us on those issues here in the province will not really take them serious because whatever they do they want to undermine any government a government that does not include them is not a government it's unfortunate uh so that is why we are committed to work with anyone who's prepared to respect all the players that are part of this govern and the critics saying and people saying you are doing this because you want to position yourself as we know that DC will be going to a conference in 2027 and we know that uh the current leader is not available for the SEC for the third term based on I'm also not available I'm on record I'm not available I really believe we need consolidate how the economy of is massive almost 35% of the entire economy of our country if you can't geten right it's going to be very difficult to get some sectors of our of our society right I've been on every platform those that are accusing me can't even give evidence that indeed this particular individual claim that he wants to make himself available but I have put proof in every platform that I've been given that I'm not Ken I'm not interested I'm still wet behind my ears and therefore people are using my name as or to project me as this ambitious person that wants to take over I'm prepared to remain in strengthen and ensure that Howen becomes the economic Powerhouse of our country"
xmW5CIgBRG0,"Tito Mboweni | ""Whilst we had disagreements at times, we respected his ethics"" - Matthew Parks",2024-10-13T10:12:42Z,14312,and of course Mr Parks thank you so much for making time for us this morning on the agenda first of all let's get your immediate reaction to the sad news of the passing of the former Minister uh Mr moeni uh good afternoon thank good morning thanks for having us um it's quite a quite a shock I think none of us expected it um I think we really want to wish his family his colleagues as friends um our Ali the African National Congress well during this period it's never easy to lose a loved one and I think we want to pay tribute to the role that he has played uh during The Liberation struggle and also in building a Democratic Society afterwards um he definitely run his race um he led a a powerful a an impressive journey and I think one that will inspire many generations coming after him and whilst we had disagreements at the time we always respected his his Integrity his ethics his credentials and we appreciate his forthright is honest approach to to to to life and I think it is a sad loss as a sad moment in our Democratic dispensation and Mr Parks you know so much has been said throughout the course of the morning I want to hear from you because so much has been said about Mr moeni having shaped and shifted the labor landscape here in the country and as you've also rightfully mentioned that there were also times where you did not really agree let's talk about those times and how you had found common ground to move forward yeah so look we had difficult moments with him um as a Reserve Bank Governor um we always have this policy disagreements with the Reserve Bank uh but obviously as a minister of finance we had some very robust um times quite heated discussions but we never doubted his Integrity or his ethics we never question for moment this is an absolutely honest person and where he agreed with you he was he would acknowledge a coed and where he disagreed he'll be honest and say explain exactly why and because part of the nature of being a minister of finance that you will not have you will not have an easy easy task with anybody but I think we also appreciate that he was our first minister of Labor in the Mandela Administration and the whole rft of our progressive labor laws that today protect workers rights to form a trade Union to strike to collect a bargaining protects the rights uh from abuse of our most vulnerable workers the right to work in a safe environment to maternity leave to overtime pay um to the basic condition of employment to pay holidays all of that was put into law during his 10 years Minister labor he played a key role in that regard and so today millions of workers are benefiting from his legacy as a minister of Labor and of course he also was a Founding Father for nlac which is play a key role where government and business and labor can come together to address uh challenges facing working-class communities the economy to put in place a variety of interventions so that's also part of his legacy and uh you know I think he was part of the generation of leadership um of you know like priv Gordon of Zola sque of K ASO the the entire the founding fathers of Democratic dispens dispensation who show that you can reach the highest echelons of power in society in the state and not for for pray to The Temptations of Corruption of stealing um no one ever doubted his Integrity he served South Africa for 30 years in different capacities public and private and yet he never had a single Scandal to his name I think that just shows you that Society can produce you know talented persons leaders um who can lead by example not not you know embarrass us on Sunday newspapers I think he is part of that generation I think his large than life personality will be missed um you know he was not one to be shy about sharing his cooking recipes and I think even during his retirement chapter of his life um he returned to his community in Zan and he was a Relentless Ambassador for tourism for that untapped part of the of of the country and I think one must also be proud that somebody who grew up in Bordeaux which a very poor Village in zanin in paved roads who went to school in Bona High School in k um can reach the most difficult uh positions in society minister of Labor Minister of Finance governor of The Reserve Bank First African Governor so it shows you that you know South Africa despite all the challenges of a part of discrimination of poverty of inequality that the doors of learning um of opportunity are being slowly open the shackles of party are being removed and I think you know commito um he he he championed lifelong education he was very proud correctly so of his qualifications of accomplishments at the University of lutu of the University of East Anglia and I think he always appreciated that education is a lifelong journey so I think his legacy does give an inspiration to young kids across society that you can reach the highest positions of society by embracing education by working as hard as you as you possibly can all

YBgEViF6_8g,"""We need to be outraged by what is happening on our roads"" : SA Against Drunk Driving - Caro Smit",2024-10-13T09:17:04Z,1077,accidents has brought Road Safety into sharp focus in the country just yesterday at least seven people died and nine were critically injured in the in an accident in the Eastern Cape now on Friday school children died in an accident on the N2 in guaza in a town let's further unpack for you this further with founder and director of South Africans Against Drunk Driving Carol Smith who joins us now on teams and Carol it's great to have you thank you so much for your time so what do you make of the state of South Africa's road safety and how people generally just um heit the call to be safe on the roads you know basically I think people don't take the call to be safe on the roads seriously because these Road Safety campaigns awareness campaigns have no impact at all what we have to rather do is use evidence-based practices to change what is happening so we need to be absolutely outraged at what is happening on our roads we losing 35 people every single day on our roads what we tend to do in South Africa is when there is a death of over five then we announce it but every day 35 people die and probably about another 200 are severely injured so instead of having awareness campaigns we ask asking the government transport Health president everybody to prioritize road safety and to use data so for example we know that speed kills and internationally what they are doing is asking countries to bring the speeds down maximum of 100 kilometers on highways and 30 kilometers in the urban area where there are schools and high pedestrian areas cuz you know if we educate children for example to look right left right and then a vehicle comes through the 100 km it's going to kill that child but if you put in traffic calming like speed bumps outside schools or high pedestrian areas that will force vehicles to slow down so the only thing that will force people to change behavior in South Africa is if there are good engineering practices changing the shape of Roads putting in traffic calming putting in um separated pedestrian sidewalks uh and cycle tracks because if we if we think of it that the the most of the people who are killed in South Africa are are V vulnerable Road users like pedestrians and cyclists so they should be separated from the traffic because they have a right to be safe on our road we need to move away from thinking only about vehicles and speeds and good roads for vehicles we have to look at at at at at streets for life for everybody and the other thing we have to um we have to know the only thing that changes behavior is it people are scared of the legal and the financial repercussions of their action so we have to have a lot more testing testing of alcohol and then if they're over legal automatic criminal record if they kill automatic jail sentences so very Swift sentencing and and repercussions and people are speeding speed fines immediately high speed fines if people are not buckling up fines because if you think um if you if you look at a lot of the crashes that happen in South Africa you see that people are thrown out of the vehicle and they die seos of very very good at keeping you in the vehicle and safer um so you know we have to what we have to do is use data analyze what's happened at the crashes look at the black spots so if we see an area where there have been a lot of head-on collisions because people are overtaking and and then do like they do in in countries like New Zealand then what you do is you put spill steel barriers along the middle of the road so that people cannot overtake at those places so we have to yeah why are crashes happening at certain places you know we what we have to remember is that they are not accidents most times they are preventable crashes and so using data will help to make them much much safer yes carara and I want to come in there you know and I know as you continue to reflect as well so much has been said about road safety and this is a conversation sometimes we are guilty of you know playing and pausing during October which is transport month now yesterday there was actually a a heartbreaking piece of one of the mothers of the victims of that tragic accident in guazu Nal I think it was Miss if I'm not mistaken Carol now I think you know no parent deserve to receive such a call you know to tell them that their child has died on the road or in any other way as a matter of fact so how do we start having such conversations about Road Safety particularly when it comes to the household because sometimes parents can't even control the behavior of their teen children yes um so I lost my child in a preventable crash someone who'd been drinking them then driving I am the voice of my child because he has no voice I am the voice of the people who killed or severely injured on our roads because it throws us into Everlasting grief but not only that if you think of the fact that if this person was for example the bread winner it throws that family into poverty or further into poverty and then it has repercussions in terms of uh um um the cost to their C to the country to the Social Development grants to you know the cost of each each loss of life is about 6 million in South Africa and what we have to do we have to stand up and say it's actually enough you know there is for example and I really really sympathize with all the victims but if you look at Marana 34 people died tragically there was a lot of Investigation about this if you look at the George building collapse 34 people died tragically a lot of invest investigation if you look at in your Benny Tavern um 21 children died tragically a lot of investigation and anger if you look at the fact that we are losing 35 people every single day on our road why is there not anger and outrage and action all right okay Carol Smith unfortunately we have ran out of time I would have wanted us to continue with this conversation but thank you so much for your insights that was caros Smith there joining us on teams and she's the founder and director of South Africans Against Drunk Driving there thank you so much

syXLZFyLWik,"Tito Mboweni | ""SA has lost a dedicated public official and economist"" : Prof. Raymond Parsons",2024-10-13T08:44:25Z,9980,let's continue now to get you more reaction on D's passing we now uh speak to Professor Raymond Parsons from the UN Northwest University in Port shrom the business school there Prof Parsons thank you for your time so you just heard just now in conversation with Dr leoda you know he shared so much on his tribute therefore the former Minister let's hear from you and how do you remember tieni yes good morning to you and I'm very s to hear about to and the way he's passing and I send my condolences to to his family because I think South Africa has lost a dedicated public official and Economist over many years and as you've indicated he served South Africa in several high rows firstly as the minister of labor for about five years as governor of The Reserve Bank for 10 years and as Minister of Finance for 3 years so over that period and over that very former period for South Africa he brought his deep economic insights which greatly shaped the structures and the institutions some of them of our post apartate South Africa from a personal point of view my own personal and professional interaction with him was at two levels in the early years on behalf of organized business I had frequent engagements with him on a wide range of issues isues uh we had robust but Frank discussions I think one always knew where one stood with him uh he had firm views but he was prepared to engage and the important point was that at the end of these discussions you knew exactly where you stood with him and where he stood with you I think among the pieces of legislation in that period which were very important was the formation of nedlac and of course there was the labor law debate that we had at that time then secondly and more closely I was on the board of The Reserve Bank for some years while he was governor so I got to know him a lot better then and we had very important roles to play both as the board directors and as uh we engaged with with the with the governor who of course is the the chairman of the board and I would guess that probably it being the longest period in which he served in high office which was 10 years he made his biggest impact there because he showed strong leadership he was very protective of the autonomy of uh of the Reserve Bank and issues such as the role of the monetary policy committee the introduction of inflation targeting to which reference has been made the I think under his ages there was another step in the evolution of monetary policy and I think I think all this stands as testimony to his leadership to his grasp and whether one always agreed or not that was not the issue the important was he showed decisive leadership in shaping some of the the the in fact post apartate institutions in South Africa and that's I think an important Legacy that he leaves for South Africa yes Prof and of course you did just speak about how robust you know and irm some of those discussions were on many occasions and this also shows that it was okay to disagree with him let's talk about this Legacy as well what Legacy do you think he leaves behind I want you to expand on that well I think as I've indicated I think se's most important one uh was his soier at The Reserve Bank and the issue of monetary policy of interest rates inflation targeting uh and uh helping to protect the autonomy of the central bank which is important for South Africa and above all I think the important point that per peps comes through which I must put right up front before I talk about other technical issues he was a man of integrity he he had an Integrity leadership which shown through all his arguments whether one agreed or not the so I think the Reserve Bank issue was important I think of course there still a lot of debat about uh the framework of our labor law we obviously needed a new labor law and I remember well the the the the tough engagements we had over the finalization of that there was the issue of nlac of course which also was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by the Democratic Parliament under his ages so I think these are also issues to which we must testify to to his legacy as Minister of Finance I think what he did was to uphold some of the principles of of fiscal discipline of of ensuring that uh we didn't get into a Deb trap uh he wasn't there for very long it was probably two or three years I think nonetheless he also was able to bring to that portfolio much of the experience the insights that the that would come from having been both a minister of Labor and the governor of The Reserve Bank so I think what see the past three decades of South Africa is very much also a testimony to what someone like heni would bring in terms of his economic leadership to the decision making of South Africa all right that is of course uh Professor Raymond Parsons there from

ex5cah4_yWU,"Tito Mboweni | 'He restored investor confidence in SA"": SABC News Economics Editor, Tshepo Mongoai",2024-10-13T08:28:50Z,840,tributes are pouring in for former Finance Minister Tien who died in Johannesburg yesterday yes after a short illness well further details will be shared in the coming days but for more on the story we joined virtually by sabc news economics editor tppo maai tppo a very good morning to you thank you so much for joining us you know we asked our viewers to share with us some of their fondest Recollections and memories of dto bweni and to so many of people tieni meant or he was different things to them to some he was a former Reserve Bank Governor Finance Minister and to some they know him for his cooking skills but what kind of a man was tieni to you and you being in the economic space for quite a while now I'm sure you have crossed paths with him several times what kind of a man was he to you well um I think he he likes um to have f as well at times uh but most importantly I think what was remarkable is uh when he banned um cameras from the monetary policy committee briefings uh after of course you know how especially the print media can be in their selection of uh pictures uh depending on the type of stories that the story that they're trying to to to to portray H and I think that was um quite remarkable at at at the time but I think generally um you also um came across as someone who really worked very hard in terms of restoring investor confidence in South Africa and remember at the time when he was appointed as the governor of the South African Reser Reserve Bank he was quite young and he had saved a couple of years um but not more than five years as the minister of Labor and um at the time uh of course South Africa was facing a number of challenges we had a huge debt to to to to Service uh there wasn't much confidence uh and in fact that's was part of the reason why the national party was forced to hand over power uh to the government of national unity and I and there were a lot of criticism that why would uh a government appoint a politician in that particular position and I think there was a lot of good work that was achieved remember under his watch South Africa of course and achieved that 6% economic growth yeah although a number of people were quite critical uh saying that um it was a jobless growth um there were a lot of discussions that um indeed that 6% growth need to factor in ways to ensure that there are enough economic uh OB opportunities that are created and unfortunately we've never been able to achieve um even half of that of that growth uh 3% is still um quite a dream for South Africa we are still struggling uh to achieve anything uh closer to that and of course the issue around the shareholders we at The Reserve Bank and the nationalization of The Reserve Bank he had um uh some exchanges with some uh of the shareholders uh some happened in front of the media uh you'll recall um his exchange with one of the shareholders Michael D uh who went to the bank AGM uh Barefoot uh and with shorts and um that did not go very well with the governor and of course uh that gave rise to uh the issue of nationalization of the bank as we know it today and the fact that that Bo was the first to defend uh the privatization uh of uh of the bank or ensuring that the bank assets Remain the the the you know under the government or or serve the interest of all South Africans despite several efforts by some sh holders who had motives uh to um ensure that when they receive their dividends like in any other company's shareholder is based on the the performance of the bank uh if they want to sell those shares they can actually be rewarded based on on on on on their share but unfortunately they Bo was able to to defend that stance there was a lot of money that was spent with the lawyers uh to ensure that the bank H is protected from any attempt uh by those particular private sholders and and and and their their plans did not materialize to the very same day and of course although there are current talks that the bank should be nationalized uh but uh those private shareholders actually don't have any significant uh say in in the running and the decision making of the African Reserve Bank now SEO we know that tieni in some circles has been described as a leader with a very unorthodox leadership style so having said that do you think that um it translated into a very robust leadership skills especially while uh he was at the ham of the treasury well I think and I think he has expressed that himself um when you go go to institutions like the South African Reserve Bank or national treasury you'd probably have your own ideas and thinking but um you do have uh people who are there who have been in those institutions and they start to make you aware of certain realities that South Africa is confronted with that one may not be aware from outside and and and I think that too he he accepted certain realities uh once he's inside uh the bank uh that certain things are done in in a particular way that that they've done H and I think of course the issue of transformation um there was some acknowledgement especially after he had left a public office H and he established a company called boen brothers h and he was at pains uh to realize in something that he had not been aware of I suppose and which he ought to have been aware of was um you know the struggle of small business to access funding because he actually said that look as boeno brothers they've been trying um to raise Capital but the banks would not assist them and I mean for someone like him who had very good relationship with banks um he he struggled um to to access those funding and and he actually went on to say that um you know laws needs to be uh changed and government needs to play a a big grow uh through its um developmental Financial like your IDC and and other institutions uh to create this Grand uh if I can call it State Bank to assist uh small businesses it's still a big problem even today all right list to you thank you so much for sharing your Recollections of D boeni all right joining us virtually was sapc news economics editor at SEO Mong and he's been sharing us you know his Fondest Memories and Recollections of D buen and he himself as having worked in the economic space for a long time having cross paths with him several times e
F2o7bqyFq2A,Tito Mboweni | 'The Duke of Mogoebaskloof' was a steadfast leader in his own way: Dr Pali Lehohla,2024-10-13T08:19:43Z,13722,all fronts covered for you as we continue to get reaction right here on the program we also speak to former statistician General Dr on the passing of D thank you so much Dr Lea for your time on the program uh so first of all how do you remember our former Minister Tito moeni and I'm sure he's been described as so many things as we continue to hear tributes pour in we've heard how people have also described him as a very decisive leader but how do you remember him attended University in and married there in the vicinity of the university is one man who has really not forgotten his roots in and he tried his skills in putting on a blanket rather but nonetheless putting on a blanket but he was a very decisive um I would say very stubborn er a very steadfast leader in his own own way H the moment I remember him very well where we had a very interesting encounter was when I had a problem with the Consumer Price Index which made in many ways made South African suffer ER and a number of them suffered because we miscalculated the CPI I was going to talk to him about how we will review economic statistics and I was with the current statistician General going to see him in 2002 he was quite excited about it he received us well you could see in his eyes that he was expecting something bigger than what I was presenting to him so as we left he said statistician General I can see the PPI is behaving very well but the CPI is going the wrong way I said oh Governor there's no problem with the CPI I assured him but it didn't take long before we realized that certainly the CPI was being miscalculated H and we worked on this program very well and ultimately got the CPI quite correct in the country and improved the economic statistics of the country I also remember him well in his transformative program that he ER worked on when he was Minister of Finance in 2019 and we had to H confront each other where I we were proposing a different path and he was proposing his own path um and uh one of the things he said was well I'm going to consult the United Nations economic commission for Africa on this program and you guys if you are not following on what I'm saying H I'm not going to ban and of course one would have to say well he was a very stubborn person because whatever he was doing on that policy we haven't actually gotten out of the problem in South Africa as a minister of Labor I think he brought very Progressive laws into our environment H that are actually at times being challenged but certainly he as a minister of Labor brought very Progressive laws one cannot forget his cooking skills the laugh of pill charts that he the the the mayor or the the Duke of mahasu always entertained us with a number of skills very down to us kind of person certainly and uh he's greatly missed and real condolences to his family he left us at a tender age we still expected a lot from him H and his steadfast stand that he would take uh including in his own party he was always that kind of outlier leader that stood steadfast on principle and on policy that is the that one actually knew and for us in L we usually embraced him and really loved him greatly for the kind of love and reciprocity he delivered for our country in the and Dr Le must say I chuckled there as you made reference to his cooking skills on uh social media because you'd also see some people also you know uh piggybacking on that to say that he must actually collaborate with that tinfish brand as well but also as you speak on his legacy programs as well as policies as well I want to hear from you how do you think some of those policies and programs shaped the country being South Africa well I mean the the the the the from the side of the Reserve Bank they introduced inflation targeting and at that time I was statistician General h i I played a big role uh in actually determining what should go into the basket for purposes of inflation targeting as a statistician General I don't set policies but I I create the mechanisms by which those who set policies can make whatever they want to do uh to to to succeed so we worked with the Reserve Bank very closely in terms of determining uh the quantities and the kinds of products that would have to go into into into into into the basket uh that served us well for some time but at the moment I think there's a lot of criticism around inflation targeting and in part it might be responsible for uh the financialization of the South African economy uh but the the the instruments that they put in place brought about a level of governance in the country that we saw H and of course he was there in 20 from 2001 to 1999 to 2008 when we saw South Africa actually progressing quite well economically of course many would argue that it did so on the back of China but if we remember those that momentary years of about six years where we dropped a debt to GDP ratio to 25% where we once knew that we could grow as a country at 6% I was statistician General measuring this gross fixed Capital formation was 24% of GDP and uh Landing was at about 15% annual growth H so those were the happiest just that they were too short uh and I think those are years Within was governor obviously later when he become Minister of Finance that's where we had a banter on these economic policies that certainly a number of ourselves say that they are not taking us anywhere not in the report of 2019 by treasury not in the current erpp economic recovery and plan which is actually anchored on that document of 2019 not in the government of national Unity I think if we were to H provide some um re uh what do we call recourse H is to really look into those policies and say well how do we change this policies so that we can actually create intergenerational H value uh to subsequent Generations at the moment if we look at our economic policies certain they are not bringing any and they will never bring any intergenerational value to this country the blacks and the colors unfortunately remain at about 20% as skilled people compared to H 60% amongst Indians and whites and if you look at the data from the sensus we are actually failing to provide intergenerational value while women are actually performing better but the graph is all heading south and certainly it's because of the economic policies that we have we need H to go and look at the legacy of the likes of Mr Dr and say how do we change our C in South Africa in order to honor H his commitment to the struggle and his wish for a different South Africa those policies have to be looked at very very painstakingly in order to see to it that this country becomes a different one at the rate at which we are going certainly the demographic dividend will be a pip dream among blacks and the colors it's a serious pip dream and we have a Vortex of disaster for people who are 15 to 34 they don't have jobs they don't have education they have no better future the only time they will see money is when they get to the age of 60 and at 20 years they look like they are 60 years old so these are the difficulties that we face and in order to honor Tito's Legacy as a person who worked very hard and believed that South Africa can do better although the policies couldn't take us there we need to set reset and make this country work in order to honor because he lived the simple life of the che of M all right that was former statistician General Dr Bali Le hodler joining us there for for his tribute thank you so much indeed doctor for that tribute

V-ZDOV7Hchk,"Breast Cancer Awareness | The commercialisation of campaigns helps: Anthea Ogle, Reach For Recovery",2024-10-13T07:38:09Z,487,welcome back and we continue our focus on breast cancer awareness throughout October we've seen campaigns everywhere from pink ribbons and products to major corporate sponsorships but with the increasing commercialization of these campaigns there's an important question we need to address is it a good thing while the funds raised support research and awareness some critics argue that these efforts risk overshadowing the real message and focusing more on the profits than progress and joining us this morning uh for this discussion is an Ogle Johannesburg Regional secretary at Rich for Recovery a breast cancer support organization anthia very good morning thanks for joining us welcome thank you for having me it's wonderful it is it certainly is and thank you for making it for making time to join us because it's such a very pertinent and vital conversation not just in October but beyond it should be a year-long conversation but the focus this morning is the commercialization of uh you know awareness campaigns do you believe that such commercialization helps or hinders the fight against breast cancer I believe it helps it helps very much so um in terms of getting the word out there you need a platform to do that and even if you dedicate one month for the whole year that's awesome you'll get people that watch you'll get people that listen you'll get people that will respond to you people that will never know that there's an Avenue for help yes and getting the support during October is also important because you can focus on getting that support and straight after that you can focus on where does that support need to go where in your organization do you need those funds to go so there needs to be some Avenue where you can campaign for the support reach out to those people who or organizations that don't have uh breast cancer uh campaigns yes and you can get those funds and you can tap into those funds it's very important to reach out to all communities Rich poor uh people who can afford the uh the help or not help uh in in our circumstances we help people with uh that have recently had momies that prosthesis is not affordable to everybody so what kind of help do you offer do you so it's basically going to the state hospitals and uh meeting with these recently diagnosed women and men sometimes um and helping them if you've just had a mistake toy we are there we we Supply the the the momies we help uh these ladies by fitting them with the appropriate bra cuz that's another important issue do people have bras that fit them do the do the bras are these bras the correct size for them right and we fit the prosis that fits them and at the end of the day you wouldn't know do they have a pris are they reconstruct you you absolutely wouldn't even know that's the deta project that we are busy with that's what it's called the the service that we provide the det project which means helping people get to the same that they were ditto means the same right so that's what it basically stands for and you need more funding you know to push this mandate and having said that how does your organization then balance the need for fundraising with uh you know maintaining the Integrity of breast cancer awareness well we've got a support from National which is based in Cape Town and then we've got um a lot of branches around the country so many women like me we are all um um breast cancer survivors and it ranges from um all the different types of breast cancer and we we know what people have gone through what these women have gone through so we are the best people to stand in front of them and say look at me look how far I've come look where I am and that cancer isn't a dead sentence it's actually sometimes it gives you a new release in life you you um look at it and you say God has making you understand that there's a different path true and sometimes we we look at life we in this red race and that's all it's about and sometimes having an illness will make you think it's not your way it's God's way it's God's way it's absolutely God's way and uh you know do you think that corporate involvement broadens the awareness of uh you know such campaigns or does it in a way dilutes the message not at all I think it helps in in a big way um giving you that support giving you a platform and at the same time um employees are exposed to that same help sometimes people don't want to come forward and say uh hi I've I've got a problem they're scared of losing their job yeah so when when they see that a corporate is open to all of these campaigns they feel it's it's U it's okay to go to HR and say listen I need help this is my story so yes I I truly believe that corporates plays a big role in in the big picture and an do you think that commercial entities bring uh Innovation or efficiency into the campaign process that nonprofit organizations cannot to a certain extent sometimes a nonprofit depending on who supports them can uh get the access to staff okay but with corporate's help you can get to you can get further in in in what you your your plans are yeah and how can we ensure transparency because that's another major issue that donors or funders uh take a particularly cognizant of transparency in the usage of the donor fund so how do we ensure the transparency in how much of the money from commercial partnership Partnerships actually goes to research or supporting those affected by breast cancer I would imagine engaging them in everything that you do or almost everything that you do so if you're having a cancer day that they're there with you and they see it invite them to like for example with us invite them to the hospitals and see what progress you're making with the funds that they've donated so that's how I would say transparency would would play a role and how do you feel about companies that profit from um a term called pink washing using breast cancer awareness as a marketing strategy without making a significant contribution to the cause well those people got to they their consciences need to play on their minds um I think it's important when you have an organization that has a function do what you say you're going to do there's people that depend on you yeah so yeah is there a risk that focusing on corporate sponsorships perhaps might marginalize the smaller more uh communitybased uh you know awareness campaigns I'm sure there is a risk with that but if you are transparent and you partner with the right people with the same integrity and the same values that you have I think then the partnership will play a big role and a positive role in these communities yeah and do you believe that commercialization of these campaigns uh you know will lead to sustained long-term awareness or is it more of a short-term kind I think it's long-term and I think it needs to be sustained I think we cannot take this away it's very important that we get the message out even if it is in one month that we get the message out there is help and we need to take that help if you you find that you have a lump go see your doctor and if you don't hear these messages you might might not know that you should be going with every um if you find something wrong cuz some people are too scared to go to the doctor so yes let's have these campaigns let's get the word out it's important yeah and what have you observed in terms of the country's healthare system and you know being accessible to all because some people have been lamenting that you cancer treatments are very very expensive and you know with the introduction of nhi of

oldest townships over the years Sabu expanded his artistic talents into various entertainment forms including ballroom dance drama and African dance in 2001 Sabu and his friends founded ababi a globally recognized band known for its innovative use of marimba brass and percussion the band has performed at prestigious festivals worldwide including the Africa Festival in hmer in Netherlands the respect Festival in the Czech Republic and the world music rain Festival in Malaysia and we joined by in Studio by Sabu Jana to talk about his creative Journey Sabu a very good morning to you thanks for joining us welcome um good morning to you too sir um thanks for inviting good to have you on the show this morning just first of all take us through your your artistic Journey how it started and uh where are you headed to um I I actually I'm kind of just I think I bumped into it uh bumped into it yeah yeah but um I come from a very artistic family as well um most of my cousins are musicians um and I think the my my grand always thought I would be an Entertainer M cuz um what is it that you she saw in you I don't know actually cuz I was I was a quiet kid but every time when I had to to entertain people I I would entertain people and entertain in what form like um I would dance or I would I would uh um I would mimic someone or when when someone has just left the house I would I would just um impersonate them okay yeah and having grown up in guanga one of South Africa's oldest townships did those surroundings influence your artistic Journey yeah yeah yeah yeah I think so I grew up in a in um in a very vibrant street called aab in guanga and um every every every day was was a a an occasion yeah um every day was something and those and there would be someone singing something there would be someone dancing and yeah every day was a every day was a party in my street I I can only imagine yeah and then what influenced you and your friends to start ABA vugi what's ABA vugi about um what influenced us we actually kicked out of a band really yeah um we we we had decided that we wanted to to be self-sufficient and make our own money and we stole instruments then we went to bask at the waterfront in town and then the older guys were like no no no no this is not the way to go because we were like 13 14 mhm at the time and then when they kicked us out of the of the of the project we we then started our own and and and then invited other guys who were kicked out of another project so yeah but um um I've been been with these guys um for like 23 years now really and it's been yeah it's been great it's been great we've been recording we've been traveling together we've been performing together we've just released an album um I also have my own project called uh Sabu Jana's matimba project um which is um also um about pen African music African African leadership okay so it's um African instruments leading the band sure um instruments like etc etc um and then backed by your normal um Rhythm Section instruments like bass guitar drums and piano yeah just considering that 23 years later has your vision changed or has it remained the same I know that you started the band after being kicked out has the vision remained the same for the past 2 years it has developed it has evolved yeah it has evolved um because we we always had um three fundamental principles that when like the founding principles of the band we to to get our own instruments we to record and was to tour so every time we when we like every year or every year say say if we're recording the the the music changes a little bit and we we include more instruments and now we're doing tours in instead of um gig like you you get invited for like one gig so you do a long tour right right yeah and you've explored various entertainment forms including bullroom dance I did mention drama and African dance so how do these different disciplines inform your artistic creativity um I borom dance was something that my grand wanted me to do so I had to do it um a little bit and also my cousin was a was a national champion and I always wanted to do um what he does right so um that an African dance it was um through the project that we were in um drama was through my my my grandma's sister um so I I think um they they the the it was a a great introduction or it was a good introduction to to to entertainment to my entertainment life okay um yeah and yeah and how do you see yourself and as well as the band you know working towards the promotion and the preservation of African culture through your music um as I said um our my music I call my music edutainment so we educating while um entertaining because every time when I have to to touch an instrument I have to explain to people what this instrument is and where it comes from and because also you and and and you have to come with the with the history of that place um because also we all know that um African music is ceremonial music yes yes um so yeah it it it does bring Consciousness to to people the music does bring Consciousness which is and and it it effortlessly so actually absolutely all the best man thank you so much for joining us thank you very much for inviting strength to you all right that was sabana sharing his valuable insights and experiences with us today and it's been fantastic just hearing about the experiences and learning from his success
0A0PVVCQJFA,Theatre | 'Memento Mori' by Penelope Youngleson tackles love and loss,2024-10-13T07:25:15Z,255,and we're counting down to the premiere of MTO Mori an exciting new production created by renowned Durban theater maker Penelope jlen in collaboration with the dut drama and production and Performing technology students this enchanting work tackles the delicate subject of mortality weaving A A Magical Tale Of Love loss and the beauty of human connection joining us this morning is the creative force behind MTO Mori Penelope jlen very good morning to Penny thanks for joining us welcome good morning thank you so much for having me it's lovely to be here it's an absolute pleasure having you join us this morning and first of all congratulations on a new production what inspired you to create momentto Mori and how did the idea evolve from your children's book of the same name thank you um so it actually started off with my own uh father unfortunately dying a couple of years ago and noticing how my niece and nephew who are very young at the time was struggling to understand the idea of loss the fact that he was not going to come back it wasn't just a goodbye was it was a lifelong thing and so from there I made a short story for them and which evolved into a book which then has now evolved into a a theater piece featuring The dut students um and they've handled it so sensitively and so well I'm really really proud of them and your work I understand often explores complex themes in An accessible way so how do you approach tackling difficult subjects like mortality especially for younger audiences yeah that's a very big question um I'm used to doing more political dramas and satire was a big leap for me personally as a theater maker um Children's Theater or Theater For Young audiences is a very challenging genre I'm not sure I've handled it well but I've tried my best sure thank you I think the most important thing really is to find the human connection so even in political stories about the minutia of everyday life and about how how uh private citizens deal with their own politics and so I've tried to apply that theory to this story as well where I've really tried to be aware of how it affects individuals rather than just um my idea of what death may or may not be yeah sure and the set design and costumes are described as absolutely magical and sensory Feast can you walk us through your vision for the production's Aesthetics and how you achieved it thank you very much yeah so um I am a theater maker which means I design write produce and direct myself so the way that I make work is I picture it first so it's a picture in my head and then I retrofit it back from there so the idea of the play has been very much visual from the beginning I have an absolutely Stellar team behind me I'm n funa on set construction and youngleson on costume fabrication CLA Craig head on technical rigging and and light so it's a real powerhouse of women who are leading this team um and they're doing a fantastic job I'm very proud to say that 81% of our design set prop props costume all of it are is recycled upcycled or thrifted so we're trying to keep a very mindful also of the life cycle of objects and how we maintain excuse me a really thoughtful and and um and mindful way of making work so the design is very much inspired by children's drawings it has a quite a naive quality to it um and I really want people to feel as if they were immersed into a book that they were sitting inside a CH book while they were watching it so the style of it is quite Whimsical it is quite um sort of uh SK I almost want to say sketched in a way that you can almost picture it as being a drawing um and that you've landed inside the the the world of the story and it just say that you know the style is quite Whimsical and it features an array of whimsical characters which one resonates with you the most and why that's like asking who your favorite child is you're not allowed to ask those I know it's an unfair question it is it is especially because my students are watching they get me after but um I I will probably say and they're all going to be upset but I will probably say the mushrooms there are some talking mushrooms in the play um because the the mushrooms have a little scene they talk about being connected through the melium of Storytelling so how we're all connected to each other and how these little mushroom stories pop up as we um experience life together and of course mushrooms as we know grow in the darkest most UNH inhospitable um circumstances so um I like to think that even in a a dark and and and scary time like when someone is passing even beautiful things can grow now Penny how did you or rather how did your collaboration with the deot students influence the final product and what did you learn from that experience gosh so much um I'm very very lucky to work at dut and to work with my students I have um 14 backstage higher certificate students who are absolutely fantastic and have worked so hard in this production and I have 53 acting students who are the cast of the show and both sets of students have just been absolutely wonderful so curious so generous with their time so interested in learning um so open to to exploring themes that perhaps at first l aren't so inviting or aren't so easy to deal with um it's been a long process we've been working since the 22nd of July um which is very long for theater we normally don't have budgets to work that long so um I suppose we can thank free labor at universities for that process right but um yeah just to just to see them really choose to to excavate themselves to be willing to be open to just throw themselves open and say let's let's deal with this let's deal with the story and see where it goes has been really really warm and kind and caring as a process and I think that PE audiences will enjoy the benefits of that when they watch that it's not just my story it really isn't it really is the cast story as well yeah and speaking of the cast I mean I see there's tempus fugit and advita brevis being at the heart of the story can you tell us more about their relationship and the symbolism behind their names absolutely so um it comes from Latin the title of the play is actually Latin as well momento Mori means remember that you must die um it is a a saying that comes from ancient Rome that when a conquering Emperor came back to celebrate a victory there would always be someone at their left ear saying remember you are mortal just to keep them humble you know um and I think the um the the Resonance of that in a world which felt especially post lockdown felt so disconnected and felt so isolated we were very much in silos but so aware of death at the same time and I wanted to try and bring that back that sense of community and ritual that um death doesn't need to be final that that people stay alive in our memories that it isn't the last word so Tempest fug means time flies in Latin and aita breas means life is short and in the play they are best friends um they they they are from before time they actually live in time itself I know that might sound strange but just stick with it for now um they live in time and so we watch their Journey uh as as beings who who are who who who are endless in a way their friendship is endless but when one of them goes what happens what happens when when someone is beyond your knowledge of how things are um and so I I tried incorporate a sense of you know the the strata of history and how we deal with how we deal with death is often through ritual in many cultures we have different ways of dealing with death um in my culture for instance there is a year of mourning and then we shave our hair and then we start a new it's a sense of renewal once we've mourned someone properly and so I try to incorporate different South African rituals into the play as well of how we deal with it and I love to think about that as our grandparents grandparents talking to us through time saying yes someone has gone but they never Di as long as we remember them and so these rituals and these processes help us to to keep our families and our identity alive and so Tempest fug Nita brevis go through this journey together and we see hopefully by the end of the play that there is a really beautiful cycle of of a person being with us in our hearts as we continue with our journey and then when that Journey comes to an end the next generation will then in turn remember us and perform their own rituals and so hopefully um we have a sense of yeah of the Bedrock of our of our community being built layer by layer through this uh choice to remember all right penny and I quite like what you said that death does not need to be final thank you so much for joining us Penny thank you for having me I've really enjoyed my time with you it's an absolute pleasure we do appreciate your time all right so many thanks to Penny youngleson for sharing the inspiration and creative process behind momento Mori now this captivating uh production of course promises to be an unforgettable experience for all audiences of all ages and do not miss momento Mori at the Courtyard Theater at dut from the 17th of October to the 19th of October so make sure that you get your tickets now and be part of this exciting Journey
Vzqyn3qdXQk,Documentary | The Kingdom in the Sky: Moshoeshoe's strategy and legacy,2024-10-13T07:20:23Z,1860,in the 1820s facing Regional insecurity and famine the young Basu leader mushes settled in the mountain Fortress of tabus this strategic move protected His People Cattle and crops and attracted followers from across southern Africa these diverse people were the ancestors of what became the Modern Nation of lotu Kim's wisdom in part derived from his teacher the great enchanting isn't it and the kingdom in the sky mush's strategy and Legacy is an 8 minute documentary that delves into the origion of lutu highlighting the wisdom and Leadership of King mushes the film traces mush's alliance with three French missionaries who arrived in 1833 and played a pivotal role in the suit of survival well to share more the documentary we joined by Elizabeth du the director of Alliance France deaser and curator of the Moria Museum and archives m a very good morning to you two ladies thanks for joining us welcome morning thank you for having us good morning it's an absolute pleasure having you join us uh I'm going to start with you Elizabeth just speak to us if you can about the history of lutu and the story behind The Three French missionaries yeah so this is what what this the short movie is about it's really like U you know capturing the 200y Year Legacy of the Basu people to the the lens of the profound historical and cultural heritage and it lights the female lights the the ties between m Kim M the first and those three young missionaries who are Protestant and who played the pivotal Road in um in shaping the kingdom and um and you know like in the film his majesty L thei explains in the film that the B Sentinal is a moment for Liz to to to reflect on his past and uh you know France Francis in involvement underscore the the Deep connection between the the two Nations steaming from from King strategic vision and partnership with these missionaries in uh in 1833 and I'm sure many are wondering how you managed to you know squeeze everything the rich history and the legacy of the Basu Kingdom in 8 minutes yeah it's 200 years of shared history in eight minutes it was a challenge uh but I must say it was well done so first it was a a political request it was a request from his majesty King L II when he met the French Ambassador uh to South Africa El in Malawi last November when my Ambassador presented his credentials he wanted he shared the story of those missionaries and especially the the strong tie between mush andan kazis who played like a a kind of political advisor role and so he tell us the story and he wanted to have a film and I must say it's through the work of the scientific committee who who was on board um to Professor Carolina Amanda and of course mea the cator of who is here with us today M let me also bring you in do want talk to us about the unique Franco Basu blanket designed of course for the festivities and how it is different to the Camarena okay um I wish Elizabeth could talk to that but I will try my best because as a curator I happen to know about blankets the history of blankets in the country yeah so the history of blankets the country starts in 1861 when a British um salesman who had been sent to collect um or to curate um artifacts from L for an exhibition that was going to happen in Cape Town presented with a blanket a western blanket and apparently he loved it a lot and then at a later stage then you had SI maren which came after the Victoria blanket the Victoria blanket which Basu um call leid because we certify everything we to own it yes and um the history goes when blankets keep changing uh the initial blankets were more of um Western patterns that were attached to the British Heritage but in the later years the blanket started emulating Bas who we are our heritage and so forth and so on so we come to this particular blanket it is at the Apex of where Bas children are beginning to make um designs that talk to them but this particular blanket fuses the heritage of France and lutu and brings it together as part of celebrating 200 years to highlight the relationship between the two countries and if you look at the patterns there they have um identified key elements that would identify with and the French would identify with and fused them together to make them one so this is what this blanket has done and I see the country has held on to its identity for a very long time I mean when you think of L you think of the blankets you think of the horses the culture speak to us about how King Leia III has maintained that and his contribution to the film um it is not easy to to have access to the king and the King literally spend an afternoon with us Elizabeth myself and the filmmakers and we shot this film and I was amazed because You' swear that the King has been prepared for this interview because what he says if you listen in the film he easily talks about the Heritage between loto and France particularly starting with the the arrival of the missionaries so when we talk about King liia we cannot talk about King lia's contribution to the blanket without talking to without talking about his father about his mother in the history of Basu royalty there has always been this relationship with blankets there are blankets that will say oh this blanket was very close to thei who is King Li's dad or this blanket was in honor of MMA mahado or this blanket is in honor of Mady the current Queen so there are blankets that are specific or were designed specifically to celebrate different times in their lives the turning points in their lives when he turned 60 when the queen turned whatever so they have had huge influence on the designs of the blankets all right now Elizabeth as a royal family Elizabeth how much of the history did you know um prior to working on the documentary not a lot to be honest and uh actually I must say like um his majesty helped me and helped my Ambassador a lot by learning the the common history so that's why it was really interesting with for me personally because I learned a lot uh through the like different projects so of course the film because as I was saying before we were held by a scientific committee who were like doing research uh conducting you know guidance and really bringing factual hisor historical sorry facts so it really helped me a lot to learn more about the of course the history from Liu but also the share the story and through the call for designer for this blanket that uh we decided to create together with the French Institute in South Africa and Aranda it was a collaboration okay then I also like learned a lot you know we we received like 30 designs beautiful designs and it was really hard to choose at the end we did a pre-selection of three and for the jury and then we asked the public to vote and it was that one the one from for M who who won so yeah I I really learned a lot on that project and I'm sure I'm going to learn more I have two more years to to do as a director at so I'm sure I will learn still learn in South Africa there's just so many film bodies and supporting broadcasting platforms and streaming services so has it been a struggle as a filmmaker to get such important movies out there for the Masters to see yes it hasus been we we are trying we do have a support of mostly the countries from the European Union Yes um for instance you know that um France I mean Germany has um binali we have had some of our filmmakers that would take their films to binali and some of our filmmakers actually find it easier to live in Germany because their opportunities are more their opportunities are more open when they live in Europe and then we had this opportunity with France but working with South Africa I think we haven't done enough I I keep saying this I have worked in the film industry in South Africa and I understand the opportunities to the tea I have been in those bodies uh in the in the in the BS of those bodies like your Writers Guild as a vice chair I've been with the documentary filmmakers Association as a chair and so forth and so on and I understand the opportunities that come with whether with the NF whether with the DTI or whatever but I see South Africa more collaborating with European or Western countries and having bilaterals with those Western countries while you would expect South Africa to try by all this to have um also bilaterals given their financial muscles muscle with um countries like L which is entirely landlocked within South Africa and we share Heritage and we share similar stories so um it is quite difficult for filmmakers at home you have young people like um in in the area called M they call themselves tycoons they have a tycoon series they're doing their best but with zero budgets and it is quite disheartening and you have children that go and study film they return they end up desolate and frustrated and not knowing what to do so it is still quite difficult and we've end up having to look into European countries to support us as as filmmakers Elizabeth I want you to touch on that point that pamuk just made in terms of the bilateral between the two countries talk to us about the current relationship with the with the French and the Basu and are there any similarities between the two cultures uh not it's hard to say you know it's uh it's it's a hard question no I say what we do here you know in our Moto Itali is where France meets L so we try to have this cultural mix we try to each time we are like hosting International artists either from France or from Europe or from like uh yeah anywhere we try to you know like um do workshops uh have way for those International artists and local artists to exchange to work together so this is what we do at alance we try to have this mix uh this connection through culture because it's one one of our main mission is the second one is language so of course we teach French but we teach also the local language we teach suzu but through like um our culture Mission it's really have give the opportunity to local artists to interact to have access uh you know to um maybe film directors from from France or from a European country this is what we do we try if we can't send them abroad we try to host that at unfortunately we're out of time Elizabeth but thank you so much for joining us and uh for sharing this beautiful Masterpiece with us we do appreciate your time all right the kingdom in the sky mush strategy and Legacy is a short film on the historical ties between the suu and France we just spoke to uh Elizabeth du du the director of The Alliance France diasu and of course the curator of the

music his musical education began early largely influenced by his father a dedicated Pastor Michelle Lawrence who recognized his son's natural affinity for music now this early exposure nurtured a deep appreciation for musicality in Smoke who found solace and joy in The rhythms and Melodies he could create the Simplicity yet profounder expressiveness of the 12 Bar Blues provided him with a framework that would allow his emotions and life experiences to flow through his music smoke joins us now this morning to talk about how he became the man of the Blues smoke J very good morning thank brother thanks for having us man good to see you so much I great to see you too man thanks for injecting so much energy into this this morning let's talk about um you know how you first pick up the bass guitar and how that experience was like for you uh yeah but I was I was four years good morning to the listeners I was 4 years old where my dad taught me how to play by year okay and my dad was preaching so I would have like a three string acoustic guitar but with Bas strings and I would follow him and his guitar it was one of the spare guitars he had so he would play the guitar and preach and I would follow him at four years old and that's how my ear got developed and uh also a lot of credit to my mother because my mother's singing I always tell her when I voice my music my guitar it was voiced from my mother's voice as well so you basically come from a music family I would say I come from a music family yeah right right and then uh where did you go from there at 4 you started training and then did you did you do it professionally in terms of the training no it wasn't no no no it wasn't professional at all in fact uh soccer became my first love okay and I was a you know became I played football um from 15 but the GU said I played a bit and I was make up these songs I can't remember much of that but long story short I came to Johannesburg uh when my factory burned down in 2014 mhm and uh it was a tough time and I was selling chips and sweets at the public swimming pool in Edenville okay and uh I was making 100 bucks a day so I took my guitars and I was shy so I rolled the doors down and I would fiddle you know with my guitar play my core play for the people to come out to buy my chips and sweets that was my plan the PIP Piper was in my head I'm going to get these people to buy and I made 1,000 R and I never sang in the shower but I sang and I made 2,000 I told my wife when list said I've been following music ever since a lot has happened since then yeah oh wow and then when did you go professional uh I would say 2016 MH I started realizing that there was actually something okay this you know of I started seeing that things change I was watching it from the outside now because especially when I got given the name by the late Alfred Gyan MH uh he gave me the name smoke yeah uh that was how did that come about well I was playing with the band I was was a third three guitarist and I was like the worst guy and I was watching these guys play you know wishing and they would they would tell me about these scales and and and I would get the picture of it with a little house with a little piece extra and I would fiddle and the guy would say that your your guitar's got a smokey taste okay and then he said Your name's going to be smoke I begged him not to give me that name because the last you know the the last picture photo I took in K at was me holding my head my factory burning and all you could see was smoke so I didn't want smoke to be followed me for the rest of my life and I didn't want to tell them so they must feel sorry for me you know yeah and it say stuck and today it's my brand it's my rainbow of Hope yeah and speaking of brand you've established the brand 12 Bar Blues so how do discovering 12 Bar Blues impact your musicality and your music style yeah well I I heard the blues when I was in standard 4 for the first time my brother got a cassette and uh I listened to this Bob Dylan mhm and I was fascinated by this guy sing I thought it was a joke yeah and as iisten said there was one song that caught me called meet me in the morning it was a 12 Bar I didn't know then but that's a sound and then my brother-in-law came from the states L CH Strom May soul rest in peace he came with um with the cassette BB King and Eric Clapton and that was the sound you know and how did Bob Dylan's music then make you appreciate and understand music even more well Bob Dylan is my one of my is's my biggest I'm his biggest fan yeah yeah but the 12 Bar Blues in that song was that sound that I wanted that connected with me okay and then the blues when I heard it it it was like oh there's that is connected to that and then

-pGh5a-BH_A,Solidarity March | 'South Africa can't look away when the children of Palestine are dying',2024-10-13T06:50:05Z,4119,"we're coming up on a year on one of the most hor horrendous genocides that we've seen in the Gaza Strip and of course we know as South Africa how brutal the Israeli apartate is on the Palestinian people over 40,000 people declared dead that's not the people under the rubble majority of them women and children and so it's very important that peaceloving people all over the world show solidarity for the essential freedoms of the Palestinian people and we need to ensure that that struggle lives on and we support them the same manner in which they supported us during the anti- apartate struggle and until we got our freedom so we must not rest until they get their freedom you see I think there's a lot of talk more than action and it's up to us young leaders in this country to start mobilizing young people for example we went to Ethiopia when everyone was talking about Ethiopia being under siege as young people we went to Ethiopia we signed indemnities to say we are going to support practical and see if ethopia will continue to be bombed when there's International Community now going to Ethiopia often when these countries and when there's International problems like in Palestine people run away from the problem we shouldn't run away and speak away from this problem we must all as the International Community find ways to go to the center of this problem because there there's a 60-year-old Palestine Palestinian kid who's being bombed who's at the center of the problem we are kilometers and and miles away from the problem and all we do as adults in these countries that are free such as South Africa we talk about these problems and that's not enough so we need to see more action behind supporting the people of Palestine"

0cWMZiAPA2w,Music | Durban City Orchestra kicks off with: 'A Classical Spring Concert',2024-10-13T05:51:04Z,526,here's what's coming up on the show this morning and as the season has change and spring blooms now the Durban City Orchestra uh you know is inviting music lovers to experience uh you know the the magical the magic of classic music and from the captivating intermo from cavaleria rasana to the poignant ARA omayo Babino Caro this concert promises to transport audiences to a world of Elegance and Beauty their upcoming a classical Spring Concert promises an Unforgettable afternoon of Timeless masterpieces and joining us this morning is Char fer mura musical director and conductor of the Durban City Orchestra since 2021 he's also the co- the co-principal bassoon for the guazu natal philarmonic Orchestra he's here to share the inspiration behind this magnificent spring inspired program sh very good morning to you thanks for joining us welcome to morning live good morning Mr Damini and to all the morning live viewers all right you're speaking to Mr thank you so much Mr f for for joining us this morning now first of all can you tell us a little bit about the upcoming classical concert in Durban and what really inspired your Orchestra to organize these events so the Durban City Orchestra is based in Kadin and we've actually have two concerts coming up today at 3:30 in Musgrave at St Thomas and next week in Durban North at the bowling Club the 13th of October at 3:00 the Durban City Orchestra plays four different concerts a season and this being the spring season we invite young and old to please come and join us and your Orchestra I understand aims to promote classical music within the Durban community so what role do you think these concerts will play in achieving this goal well since moving to Durban from Cape Town oh 5 years ago I noticed that we only have an elderly uh audience so we would like to invite young and old to come and join us you know be part of the experience be part of listening and being able to see an orchestra live so we as the Durban City Orchestra you know we' just like to invite people to come and experience something that they've experienced before you know to see an orchestra live nowadays you know you can just of a click of a button you can listen to anything you can listen to things on the radio yes but when it comes to seeing the visual of actually seeing an orchestra hearing and seeing the violence being bowed or listening to the tempany being rolling rolling rolling this is an experience like no other and the repertoire for this concert is carefully curated so what can audiences expect to experience during the performances just take us through you know all the experiences that uh we will likely enjoy so firstly I also need to thank the zanzi national philonic Orchestra um without their Grant and without their sponsorship the orchestra would have closed down you know postco so many people are struggling financially and they came on board and gave us the funding to actually stay alive so we would just like to thank the zanzi national fonic Orchestra for for giving us this opportunity and then for all the the audience members that will come you know we start off with heiden's 88 Symphony um as an over for the listener just to enjoy settle down and then we actually have an upcoming soprano soloist by the name of Rachel now she will be performing with us um she's actually part of the orchestra she plays in the violin she plays the violin in the orchestra but she's also she's also a phenomenal soprano singer so she will be singing the well-known habanera um she's actually been accepted to also study uh music uh be's Opera in Cape Town at at ucct next year so we really really looking forward to see what happens wow how cool is that and as a semi-professional Orchestra let's talk about some of the challeng Alles and the successes that you face when preparing for concerts like these so I took over the orchestra in 20121 just after Co um and for me it was a challenge because the orchestra only meets once a week on a Monday evening and we all know Mondays are a long day so when I see the orchestra members on a Monday evening they all look at me like oh what a day you know but then I give them the energy I give them the energy and we are able to then you know start rehearsing so like I said once a week is not enough time but we put together a program where musicians can go home and practice and be able to then come the next week with music being prepared you know I I I always say to them you know rehearsals are not a place for you to practice you need to practice during the week so that when you come to the next rehearsal uh um you're you're more I'll be able to do more with the orchestra rehearse more with the orchestra and not just work work with them individually so they need to prepare before they come MH so who is this concert aimed at like uh um in short who's likely to enjoy this concert and who should attend this concert and what do you hope the audience will take away from this musical experience so like I like I said in the beginning uh you know I see a lot of elderly people joining and I would love to please ask the youngsters to please come classical music is not only for the elderly people it's for everyone once you experience a classical music concert you know you walk away feeling invigorated feeling like wow this was something different you know and like previously mentioned you know visually seeing it and listening to it live is like no other so we inviting young old you know kids from a young age should be exposed to classical music so like I said we've got a concert today at St Thomas in Musgrave at 3:30 and then next week in Duran North at the Northlands Bowling Club at 3:00 so please all come and attend so what's up your sleeve in terms of uh you know organizing some more concerts some more activities uh that is that are aimed at you know entertaining people especially in the classical space so as you know Christmas is around the corner yeah uh we you go to the the malls and there's already decorations happening so our concerts uh after this uh week you know we will be starting our Christmas program where we will have carols and have be able to have audience members singing with us be being able to be part of the orchestra and then actually last night one of my colleagues uh had asked me if if it will be possible for next year for him to play a a horn conto with the Durban City Orchestra so I haven't let them know about that yet I have to still speak to the I have to speak to the committee but in a nutshell till the end of the year we will be doing Christmas concerts uhhuh so what have you observed in terms of young more younger people embracing classical music as as a Pastime so so you know I I'm also a teacher so I teach classical music to young kids I also play the piano and what I always notice is that at the young age it's so easy for you to Nature and nurture the the the person into actually playing something that they can actually take away after the metric you know you can go and do whatever you'd like to go and do yeah but having the having the classical music tuition brings something else out in your brain mhm yeah okay so uh as a as a as a classical musician myself you know been playing the last 15 years in professional orchestras I can really say that classical music for young kids is essential all right charl lovely chatting to you thank you so much for joining us how do you get the tickets Please share those details just briefly so Instagram please cont contact us on Instagram Facebook and quicket you can buy tickets of quicket and then obviously we will have um tickets being sold at the door so please like I say come and join us today St Thomas 3:30 and next week at the Northlands Bowling Club at 3:00 awesome stuff sh great chatting to you thank you thank you very much sir many thanks to sha for sharing his insights and passion for music with us today that was shal F resident conductor at the Durban City Orchestra and don't miss the Durban City Orchestra at St Thomas Church mrave on uh the 13th of October or northland's Bowling Club on the 20th of October a classical Spring Concert promises to be a truly Unforgettable

LKF4-0v4TOU,Technology | Exploring data science as a career,2024-10-13T05:38:18Z,373,as the final countdown to metric exams Begins the thrill of exploring future career prospects is palpable amidst the excitement and anxiety a shining opportunity awaits in the rapidly expanding tech industry data science held as the new oil has emerged as a pivotal field revolutionizing business decisions worldwide as Industries worldwide turn to data to make informed business decisions the demand for skilled data scientist is soaring this demand presents a unique opportunity for individuals to capitalize on this booming career path now uh to to discuss this further Asif Hassam Chief technology officer at Z is is joining us via Zoom to give us an Insight on unlocking the power of data science as a career I see a very good morning to you thanks for joining us welcome hi how's it very well good to have you on the show this morning aiv yeah I'm excited about this how are you doing good man now data is increasingly driving business decisions worldwide so what skills are required to interpret and leverage this data right so like look think about if you think about it data like a form of data science has been happening since a very long time right it just became very famous with the boom of like you know AI happening right so you think about it just making Excel sheets and making graphs and pie charts and Excel sheets that kind of stuff is already something data science does but now with data science is where you're working with large data sets right and uh that like a lot of data which can be processed by a normal Excel sheets and that's where you need to learn extra skills like programming skills and uh es and mainly programming right and just using that programming skill to manipulate and understand that data and with data science and transforming Industries what role do you see it playing in South Africa's economic growth I I feel like it does play a lot like it plays a huge role right and that's because like I feel data helps you understand what you know what you don't know and you know help you pick up things that you don't know about right and trends that your business has to focus on that you need to pick up to make sure that your business grows further and I think a lot of companies dive into making data driven decisions I just feel like the econom is going to just move much more faster in different pace and having said that South Africa's Industries such as the finance and the healthcare sectors rely heavily on datadriven insights so how can data scientists M this demand so look um one of the things about here in South Africa is that the a lot of universities don't offer this uh you know this this kind of curriculum right you have to go out on way to figure it out because still new and it takes a long time to figure out what to teach and what not to teach because it's it's it's very vast and you cannot learn everything know everything comes with experience to meet that demand I would definitely say take the first thing is at least see if you're if you're a matric grad you know try if you're going to University try try and go towards stats and math degree right because a lot of stats and maths require data science or take like online courses like what we have at Z our coding boot camps what we run at Z so these kind of things I was going to like you know help you meet that demand obviously if you try to get into the industry much more quicker coding boot camps are the way to go and as if what challenges arise from the shortage of SK oh sorry I just just broke it for a bit are you able to repeat what you said yeah sure what challenges arise from the shortage of skilled professionals okay challenges like it's I mean like I said right like one one of them is uh just you have going to Outsource a lot of U you know data scientist from outside you don't have anything here which means you're going to pay aot more money right cuz I feel companies are trying to like pick up the fact that a lot of like data is a new goal right and they need to use data to to meet the like you know to actually beat the competitors right because they understand what the users want what the customers want and you not having those skills like in in your company or locally in South Africa what happens is now you need to go out and you know find data data scientist that outside of South Africa and they charge very much more right so I just feel it's gets really expensive the whole process is really gets really expensive which makes it difficult for you to keep up with your competitors now on a global scale how does the global demand for data scientists impact the local job market so the thing is that if okay look companies outside right International companies are definitely going to pay what way much more like high salaries to Da scientists right because the demand is not only in South Africa but it's it's crazy everywhere like the de Supply is very little and uh like I know tech companies also provide like you know remote jobs and um like the moment the moment that happens a lot of local talent then starts going outside and again with the same problem where you know we're not able to utilize data scientists properly because now it gets expensive again you can't be the international company's rates it's it's it's just like it's just how it is now earlier on you spoke about the fact that um data science um isn't introduced at universities because it's still a relatively new cause so let's talk about Z's data science causes that aim to bridge you know the skills Gap what sets these causes apart okay so with with with Z's courses right like we so what we what we've been teaching is fullstack web development and uh it took us a long time to figure out what data science curriculum we need to like create for so for individual looking to enter into dat science Industry right and what we do is we go out to companies we speak to companies and see what kind of uh dat what is the role of a data science what role will data science scientists play in the company right and based on that is when we come up with our curriculum right it's like very Hands-On a lot of support is given to you because it's a fairly new topic and it'll be difficult for you to grasp from the beginning so we provide a lot of support and uh yeah we try and complete that in s mon months not like a 3 to four year University degree and what we teach you is mainly what you need to to like go and get the job right it's proper practical experience right now by providing practical training Z I understand empowers aspiring data scientists so what success stories can you share so I mean like we've had quite a few students right so we done data science mainly for you know training for B2B companies we just launched our B2B one just like uh in uh two months ago and we taking our first intake actually our last uh the application date uh end date is the 21st of October right okay and um that's that's the that's the that's the end of when you can make your applications and uh yeah sorry um I just lost my thought of Chain of Thought there what was your question again no it's okay uh because I want us to move on to the fact that you know with the increasing importance of datadriven insights uh how can organizations ensure data quality and integrity hello as if can you hear me yeah can you hear me please do confirm if you can hear me I'm not sure if you're losing the line yeah I can hear you yeah I can hear you I can hear you okay sure now with the increasing importance of you know datadriven insights so how do organizations ensure data quality and integrity okay I mean like look um just getting the right Consultants right and just getting like the right U the right people in the room right who know these things and who've been upskilled in these things if you get those guys in the room I think it does actually solve the problem because they know how to do the do these things the right way yeah all right I have great chatting to you man thank you so much for joining us thank you thank you we just spoke to Asif ham the CTO at Z who explores data science as an exciting and lucrative career choice and uh what the field entails uh the skills required and of course why it's becoming one of the most sought-after professions in the digital age

look we've kept a very close contact with throughout the period when he left the Reserve Bank as the governor and uh almost every week or so we will be in contact through WhatsApp and exchanging views and ideas we didn't even know that he was in hospital we utterly shocked by his passing and we want to send our profound condolences to his family friends comrades in the African digital Congress in our view a unionist who belonged to the South African Congress of trade unions a predecessor of kadu played a critical role in the International Trade union movement in support of the South Africa worker struggle during the a date and he was patient in L and he used that proximity to South African workers to keep a very healthy conduct when he was operating from underground we talking here about a colossal Pioneer of the colonial and above dat labor market and The Who took advantage of the uh constitutional Bill of Rights in South Africa that offers workers the historic rights such as the right to form trade unions to bargain with employers to strike to negotiate Union security agreements such as the agency fee and or the uh the clo shops something that doesn't exist anywhere in the world he took this forward uh pioneering championing this transformation of the Abate labor market and today many workers take it for granted that they have a basic conditions of Employment Act that gives them a right to have maternity leave to have a overtime pay for for Sunday Saturdays to have lunch and tea breaks to have VAR over time all all of these things uh would have been very difficult to achieve if we didn't have a very sympathetic minister of Labor the very first minister of Labor post upate we will forever be inde deped to him as workers of course it didn't only Pioneer the introduction of the basic conditions of Employment Act the very Labor Relations Act the mind health and safety act that gives work the right to refuse to do dangerous work the occupational health and safety act the employment Equity act you can name them all all of those were negotiated during the era when the minister of labor was they respected intellectual and a lot of people think that he was arrogant because by Nature he was very bful everybody knows him about the pre fish that you will tweet about the the land the dinners that he will cook for himself but he was down to us he was the people's person in true sense approachable during the hard times of the negotiations of course he was as tough as as a tick he was not a pushover he held on his view but he was always flexible his was always informed by the need to ensure that the aparate labor market is formed consistent with the provisions of the Constitution we are as I just said heavily indebted to him as the South African workers we will always remember him even though we may forget when we take these rights for granted today but we will always remember that the person who we negotiated with to ensure that these rights exist and I enjoy it by every Sou afican was and we want to salute him and we deep our flags tonight very very certain by his un and Mr vavi one would ask I mean as we celebrate 30 years of our democracy and somebody who played such a crucial role during the transition from an apartate government uh to a democratic government and who was a labor Minister the first labor minister in our country what does a passing like this mean for our country particularly in of the gnu well South Africa is at the Crossroad you know today I was in PT in the Northwest and reminded today that uh we have a 54% Unemployment uh today in the Northwest and that in P room unemployment rate was at 68% black people are on the receiving end of the failure in the overall to transform their lives from what apartate would have designed for us as black people and into what we had thought that will be a better life for all of South Africa so the overall picture of South Africa is not the one that makes any black person PR proud and that's why we are being taken advantage by the pseudo leftist and sudo revolutionaries who know the Grievances of our people who are aware of the disappointed expectations that people have against even thec and the and their transformation they know how angry people are against the current status C that put black where Colonial AP have plac them landless face of poverty face of unemployment inequalities and and and without any kind of property to be real players in the economy somehow we miss we will miss the wisdom of D is a b that thec didn't find a way of utilizing is tows and the people with deep sense of commitment to that idealism of fighting for a better life that n Mana inspired Millions here at home in our continent and in the entire developing South to to to battle to battle in particular in the unequal relationship between the South and the Northern parts of the country which presentent the concentration of wealth and and the opportunities largely stolen from the deprivation and of the of the South so he was not utilized properly and he was way on the sidelines he was not being consulted and his views were not being thought by the current generations of the of thec which is a Pity and I hope that what they will learn from the death of a a person uh who was totally uncorruptable by the way this is another very important attribute of of you will never ever up to this moment hear any of a scandal of corruption associated with his name he was mistaken and and he look he he moved from the ministry of labor to the Minister of Finance and look we disagreed with him we disagreed with him when he was the we was the governor we marched to him but even as we H traded those words we did that with respect because we knew that you may have a mistaken view but his genuinity on the need to address the inequalities the the and and the upate what we call the mismatch of the upate trade Industries and labor market policies was was was deep and and that's why we could even in the in the heat of this disagreements be able to reach out to him as a person pull him on the side he will call us in his offices we have lunch there we will debate and debate deep into the evening of course uh we will recognize the fact that we we disagree and uh so we respected him in the main uh we respected him as a person as an activist and we afforded him his respect as the cap the Minister of Finance and initially the minister of Labor and Mr vavi as you talk about your disagreements uh with the former Finance uh Minister one canot uh you know talk about let you go uh before we talk about that 2018 wage agreement and many of the unions really uh showing their frustration during that period in time it was not the face of that disagreement and this was in the M the disagreement between KATU fusa and other unions against the minister of of public e who was the in the opposite of the of the negotiating table General it was a rough year the public sector workers staged a a long strike and uh in and in 2007 2008 a historic strike in terms of uh of uh the history of the labor market today the biggest in the history of South Africa and even though he became the minister and who pursued the what we call liberal and austerity programs in fact before austerity started because the austerity actually started around 2010 2011 and uh with President Jacob Zuma and and Minister PR Goan in the Helm of of the of the of the of the of the Govern and but we would have exchange SS with him when he was the Minister of Finance because in response to the what was called the Asian flu of 2007 and he somehow we we labeled them as imposing self structural adjustment programs of the IMF on the South African economy and uh we disagreed with that very very strongly but still we respected the men deeply all right Mr BBY thank you so much for your time uh that's soft to General Secretary for
mcd4au8MX4o,Tito Mboweni I ANC's Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri reacts to Mboweni's passing,2024-10-12T22:19:42Z,7788,all right let's continue now uh with more reaction we now go to thec and we are joined uh by the anc's national spokesperson mangi B who joins us now via our telephone line mangi good evening to you can we please get your reaction to the passing of the former Finance Minister I hope you can hear me can I establish yes we can hear you loud and clear uh okay I'm struggling to hear you good evening and so actually almost the morning when we get the news of the passing of one of our own um a sign of South Africa and South Africans and the people of limo when thec s by his passing um we can say so much um about what he the Legacy that he leaves behind for South Africa and for the his organization the African National Congress and I think in the days to come we'll have a moment to reflect to a great detail some of those Legacy making uh experiences of his such as one of what he remembered for is having been one of the architects of South Africa's Economic Policy having been the head of the Economic Policy Department of the African National Congress in the early '90s all the way to becoming um the governor of um The Reserve Bank making him the first black person to occupy that position and of course we also can't forget about how he served South Africa as um minister of Labor steering um a labor environment that is stable and also where all the social Partners in the labor dispensation were able to come together introduced a lot of policies and this is supporting the the legislative environment to make it possible for workers to access some of the rights that they have today all the way to becoming the Minister of Finance and I think that is the portfolio for which he was known for having steered a very fragile economy but it steered it in a way that kept the stability going and of course I can say that organizationally he served the AMC at its highest level where he had to resign all of those elected positions when to take their position in the Reserve Bank so we are truly sent um um by his passing and we are obviously going to gather our heads and our thoughts and uh we also condoled more especially with the family family or with with his children and M what would ask I mean were you aware about you know his illness and were you able to see him over the past couple of days no I'm not I'm aware at this stage if any of our peers or our leaders were in contact with the family regarding his short illness I'm sure I'm certain that we will hear about this as the time progresses and as we and as we remember you know the former Finance Minister one would also ask I mean what are your Fondest Memories of tieni if you could reiterate the question please I I was saying what are your Fondest Memories of the former Finance Minister D well one of the things that stand out for me um um on a personal level as well as organizationally was his ability to be critical and to exercise critical thinking in all of his conversations whether it was about the direction of our economy or whether it was about the work of the ANC and also whether it was about life in general he was quite a multi-dimensional person that is another thing that stood out um for me or somebody that really lived a a lifestyle that and and and was driven very much by a you know uh supporting wellness and himself um paying particular attention to you know and the well-rounded life he wasn't just a politician he wasn't just a um you know a board member of very prestigious institutions in the country and in the world he was quite multidimensional he was a whole lot more to him if you had a chance to interact with him and see how he lived his life and I mean as we speak about him tonight you know how would you want South Africans uh to remember his legacy somebody that gave so much um at a young age um to the success that South Africa is known to be with all our challenges um surely he will be remembered as somebody that was um was quite upright in terms of how he respected the popular mandate for him to occupi the roles that is occupied we have never heard of any single instance that certainly in my mind um where there were doubts about his credibility and how he utilized public resources you know and he did that to the betterment of South Africans and carried his responsibilities with I think a very good reputation leaves that behind it forms part of um the lasting Legacy that he Lees behind and uh you know talking about uh the former finance minister at the same time a number of people also talk about uh uh his uh Behavior or his relationship towards South Africans on social media and one cannot ignore uh you know the cooking lessons uh that you know he would often share with the rest of South Africans absolutely and that was really part of uh many many facets um of his life um and really as speaking about um his Wellness Journey that has always always been there um for those of us who had who had a chance to break sprad with him it's always been there but upon retirement he's had much more time to be able to really showcase his culinary skills as well um such was a man a very very interesting individual who could could hold a conversation on a variety of subjects and somebody really really who is highly accomplished and we it is a great loss it's a loss for our organization as you see some of these seasoned leaders departing and of course this was totally unexpected um he's known to be quite fit uh but what has happened has happened and what truly truly said in this organization all right that is ANC National spokesperson Mau bangui giving us a reaction there when it comes to the passing of the former Finance Minister ditto Bui

UzU5qJriZXI,Klipgat Wastewater Treatment Works functionality disputed: David Ratladi,2024-10-12T22:17:36Z,986,welcome back thanks for staying with us uh we move on to this now the invi Civic movement has disputed thean municipality's announcement that the cput Waste Water treatment works is complete and fully functional it says the extent of non-compliance and the quality of discharge from waste water treatment plants is very worrying the city however announced the multi-million Rand refurbishment and upgrade project and was completed at the end of last month for more on this we're now joined by David rat of IBC movement and he joins us now via our video link uh David thank you so much for your time I mean uh you know let's begin here I mean the tuani municipality says that it's a cput waste water treatment plant that project is now fully operational but this is something that you as the Civic movement you completely disagree with yes I to I totally disagree with that yes and give us the reasons why you you you disagree with this yeah um at first we did not have and we did not experience the water the the SE pages in our townships but then immediately that was been erected that project was been erected of course we had a very serious um pillages all over the the so those depending on all the households that are dep on that so plan before but then still now whatever the years that took for that to be you know refurbished and and and and we we we we did we did experience that the problem we still are experiencing the same problem even today I mean we are we are having schools nearby our areas and everything whereby the young kids are schooling there and they experiencing a very serious problem regarding the the blockage of the sewer part of it the SP part of it you know even most of the households that are dependent there we've got the water strings around our areas in terminal and and block D Block M blocka view it was saying we're having a block a Block B Block C we are experiencing thats that are our spillages our this thing yeah they sping at David perhaps maybe let's take a step back and maybe just give us a bit of background when it comes to the pro to the problems uh you have been faced with as a community of course due uh to the which spillage you have been experienced how long have you been experiencing this for uh we've been since from 2016 to be exact 2016 to be exact we've been experiencing that till to date we still are experiencing the same problem that has never been you know I don't know how to express that because of really we are having a very serious problem regarding that even even today when I'm talking to you my opposite they having a serious problem with the SP we've been trying to call the the counselors we've been trying to call the the the water department where they're dealing with the S sures SE Department in in they are so ignorant I mean we are having a problem regarding that I mean we have to go and look for our own people people our private people to come in and block that so really it's it's a better experience that we experiencing and how does it make you feel uh David when we see uh you know the tuana municipality saying that well uh you know they've invested so much money into this uh clipart Waste Water Treatment Plant and that actually it has really been solving some of the problems being faced by communities like yourself um um you know you know you know let me I put it this way and I'm going to be rather different with we have been charged fraudulently with with with water that is and sanitation now the sanitation side part of it when we go and investigate when we were with the the then Mayors then counselors we we we've been discussing that that is part of our our our prevence andto our memorandums um I think we've got countless memorandums that but then let me get back to your question let me answer it this when when when the building slip come to an individual household and then it reflect the sewer I don't understand what was that sewer for because of we have never been set we did not a proper service for the for the sanitation side because once I do have to pay for the sanitation and I have to be taken to court for for not being that very I don't I really don't understand what was that for and if the pro the project was completed last month as they say as they claim why the public consultation was never been made two why we were never being caued about that three why they did not rather Rectify whatever the wrong that has been committed unto our elit for why all the streams and the nearby dams are filled with dirty s pillages even today now how are they going to correct that how are we going to be about that when are they to the public regarding that now now now we've got the historical B that they said we should pay them now what is that because of really we having a case against concerning that for your information we have registered a case in high court to take for for for the incorrect and fraudulent water and sanation and I mean when it comes to sanitation and issues around you know you talking about sewer spillage in your community and you're saying that uh this has been going on for a number of years now what does it do to you know communities I mean uh clearly some of you have been living very uncomfortably uh in your homes and this has caused a major inconvenience on your part like you're saying uh that uh you know you are being built but you don't see uh some of these services in your home um when it comes to you know the community how does it feel uh with this inconvenience that has been done on them for so long uh let me rather tell you something again maybe I did not tell you earlier on I think I think previously we we we went to to S work Association where the SE and SE Department was was there by next to morulas and it's closed today and it was closed 2016 the minute after after after Da took over municipality that department was closed we had the the the the the the members who were dealing with the the reporting of the the SE pillages the the leaking of the of the meters the hot met that was leaking they were reporting that in time we were serviced correctly previously but then after that we were not serviced we were build with with estimations you know even the the the spillages the SE plages were not properly done it's either it's either the community members we need to ra gather some money to go and get the private person to come and unlock that on for for for our sake for our health sake so really we went and and and and complained to to toim the then mayor of 2016 and then we went and complained with 200 we went and complained and block that house where for for from simanga May Sanga then they he he came to us to come and address 1 2 4 we went and complain about Rand with with all them Civics all the Civics they came to us we sat down and we discussed that strategize then we went and wanted to rather discuss that with Randall Randall did not listen to us instead he did he he went and and hire or employ or appoint Deb collectors to come and collect collect that money from us and claiming that if we don't pay they will take us to cour they will take our houses for the sanitation that we are talking about that that the project were in process for so many years till today we went and and and and wanted to go and talk to to to the now mayor about the same problem about the Grievances that we are facing in our areas in terms of the same problem of of of of this thing the older people they can't they cannot even jump the the spillages they just walk through that that Village without jumping it because of the older women or older granny they cannot jump over that so it's a problem to our our citizens really is failing us and is failing this all right David thank you so much for your time and giving us Insight in terms of the issues being faced by some residents inan of course that is radi or David radi from ibcm movement telling us about the problems they are faced with saying the stage is back uh from 2016

VYk-uS-uCTI,Former Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni passes away: Sophie Mokoena,2024-10-12T21:46:25Z,12240,uh Sophie of course uh seeing the news coming in this evening uh talking about uh you know the fact that uh former Finance Minister um Tito buen has passed away uh perhaps maybe just give us some of uh you know your uh interactions with the former Minister Parliament as a parliamentary correspondent at that time he was the uh the the the the person responsible for the Central Bank the governor of the Central Bank the first black governor of the central bank but I think for me when he was appointed by the Rwandan president Paul kagami to be part of the team that was given a task to look at the reforms of the African Union you know that it was launched in 2000 and uh the first uh leader of that organization after it was transformed from organization of African Unity to Au it was South Africa and when there was a decision few years ago by the Au that they must look at perhaps positioning the Continental body uh in line with the current challenges he was part of that team and he was a appointed because they were looking at the input that he can bring as someone with f experience of economy but also someone who has led the Central Bank of South Africa and now being respected well Dwight and therefore he worked very close with President Paul kak he would travel to Rwanda many people will recall that he would often post on social media about his experience es in Rwanda all the time when you went to Rwanda it was because they were working on the reforms of the African Union and secondly he was in Exile in loto and therefore he would often visit loto not so long ago he was in loto you know that he studied at Roma University in loto now called L University and with people like Dr P laa the former premier of Li Advocate R so he was one of those people who went to Exile and stayed in lotu and even in recent times he visited lotu where he was honored by the same University sabc was there we did a story where he spoke about his appreciation of how Basu treated them but also supported them and which led to him even uh being able to acquire the education that he later used as a first black uh Central Bank Governor or The Reserve Bank governor and at that time his Deputy was Mr timoy tahani Mr Timothy tahani came from loto and he was the deputy of the Ben governor and therefore he he he to also attend all these multilateral uh Gatherings particularly of financial institution as part of the United Nations Your World Bank meetings your INF meetings including the well economic Forum so he was well known I must say because of his involvement with IMF and the well bank but on the continent also very uh passionate about the development and the transformation of the continent and it came as no surprise to some of us when he was part of this important team that looked at the uh transformation or changes within the African Union agencies and they were led by the president of Rwanda Paul and Sophia I mean you are highlighting uh you know the role he did play on the African continent but zooming into Rwanda one would also ask why does why did Rwanda remain so close uh to his heart and something that he often even got into trouble for uh by many South Africans and social media you know that uh Rwanda is always looking at people and countries where they can learn uh You' recall when I spoke to the president of Rwanda Paul gag earlier this year just before the commemoration he spoke about how South Africa played a prominent role in giving capacity in terms of people who occupied High positions now in Rwanda and some of them studying in South Africa and therefore Rwanda always look to South Africa in terms of capacity building and that is why they created a relationship withen as a former governor particularly on issues of development and that is why he would often visit Rwanda and share his experience in terms of how this country that was literally literally a s State a dead country after the genocide how it has emerged and that is why and you even there was a time where he wanted to uh stop communicating on then Twitter now at and it was on that platform the president of Rwanda Paul gagan said no you must continue to be on this platform because people would want to hear from you as someone on the continent with v experience on issues related to the economy and let a a a a reverse Bank in South Africa that became so successful and your legacy cannot be forgotten so it it was very very very personal but also it developed into a personal relationship it had to do with his work and his skills and the continent was stepping into his skills even though he was sitting there at makat Ro and Sophie you know this death comes at a time where South Africans have just Bid Farewell to another former Finance Minister provin Gordon and now uh we are seeing the death of you know another uh former Finance Minister Tito boeni what does this all mean um for South Africa particularly a time where we're losing two former Finance ministers in one year Well indeed this is what happens uh people do pass on the question is their contribution to the nation and the development of the country the continent and the world and this is what we will always uh talk about when it happens and therefore that is why today we are also talking about d d i mean he was a colleague to Prine when Prine was ah head of ss and therefore they were running these important institution they were part of the leadership of South Africans who are driving the economic direction of of this country and working uh with Treasury and therefore later he did occupy that position of being a finance minister but the first black governor of the Central Bank of South Africa we call it Reserve Bank and therefore that history will remain and he was then deputized by timah from loto and I think they identified him know the people from L who would have expertise in helping South Africa to during the you know transition as the power shift from those who occupied power before 1994 to the black majority and people like tieni led the way you would recall that he was also the minister of Labor during Nelson Mandela's cabinet he he was there he was the first minister of Labor uh after 1994 therefore he had a very vast experience and when he was appointed the labor Minister he was very very very young these are some of the people who were very young in Nelson Mandela's cabinet and of course later in tab B's era you had him as being the Central Bank governor and uh later he became the Finance Minister I think and then of course on the continent as I pointed out leading uh with the p in terms of the transformation of some of the agencies of the African Union so that it can be able to discharge its responsibility uh during these different times these difficult times where the focus is all about global uh development and formation of the financial system these are the people who came handy to assist the African Union behind the scenes to be able to Grapple with those kind of global challenges

naQDl635ANM,Middle East conflict I Solidarity march for Palestinians,2024-10-12T21:44:48Z,1300,"welcome back South Africa can't look away when the children of Palestine are dying this is the view of those who joined a solidarity March for Palestinians at lodium in Petoria South Africa the war in the Middle East is Raging on while peace talks have collapsed and there's no end in sight for a lasting solution sabc News International editor Sophie M spoke to tut Zuma and Lux who joined the Walk we're coming up on a year on one of the most hor horrendous genocides that we've seen in the Gaza Strip and of course we know as South Africa how brutal the Israeli apartate is on the Palestinian people over 40,000 people declared dead that's not the people under the rubble majority of them women and children and so it's very important that peaceloving people all over the world show solidarity for the essential freedoms of the Palestinian people and we need to ensure that that struggle lives on and we support them the same manner in which they supported us during the anti- apartate struggle and until we got our freedom so we must not rest until they get their freedom well I think like the question becomes uh we saw how South Africans supported the Palestinians since it started but nothing is happening yes you see I think there's a lot of talk more than action and it's up to us young leaders in this country to start mobilizing young people for example we went to Ethiopia when everyone was talking about Ethiopia being under siege as young people we went to Ethiopia we signed indemnities to say we are going to support practica and see if Ethiopia will continue to be bombed when there's International Community now going to Ethiopia often when these countries and when there's International problems like in Palestine people run away from the problem we shouldn't run away and speak away from this problem we must all as the International Community find ways to go to the center of this problem because there there's a 60-year-old Palestine Palestinian kid who's been bombed who's at the center of the problem we are kilometers and and miles away from the problem and all we do as adults in these countries that are free such as South Africa we talk about these problems and that's not enough so we need to see more action behind supporting the people of Palestine we need to see more young people being mobilized educated I'm happy that there's a city of Johannesburg that is changing sentent drive to Lea KH drive but that has caused so much controversy yes at some point Nelson Mandela was controversial and you loved the man at the end of the tunnel so at at some point wiim Mandela was a terrorist but we loved the woman because we learned about her real work and a real contribution to the to the struggle of of to the freedom of this country that we're all fighting for at some point my own grandfather was arrested I grew up thinking that he's a criminal until I was corrected to say no the man was fighting for the country so we are not going to allow the controversy to dim our light we are not going to allow the the media sponsored controversy to to deviate the cause we are going to rename sent Drive into Lea KH drive because somewhere in the world there's a street called Nelson Mandela drive somewhere in the world there's a street called Steve boo why because they were conscientia are facing and it's time that we exercise the same responsibility and we do the same for our young people and the future of this country and your view this controversy ISC ready to handle the questions around this decision I think the first thing is to say often times in history women are erased out of the history books and Lea Khaled is an International Freedom Fighter loved by all peace loving people and she's a freedom fighter of the Palestinian people who when she was a child was survived the nakba in the late' 40s was driven into Exile has lived in Exile her family still lives in Lebanon and has dedicated her entire life to the struggle of the Palestinian people and women like her must be celebrated and part of why we chose Sant and drive in particular is because we want to give her a prominent place in our country and we all know the significance that santon and particularly santon drive has so it's about showing solidarity to the people of Palestine keeping their struggle alive and in our Consciousness and in our faces but also about celebrating this renowned women freedom fighter"
R5ukew191qM,Mental Health | Making treatment measurable: Safia Joseph weighs in,2024-10-12T21:41:09Z,255,good evening in a society where mental health challenges are on the rise the need to manage mental health and well-being has never been greater ensuring treatment outcomes are measurable to improve patients quality of life has become crucial tools like the mental health questionnaire 14 allows Healthcare Providers to assess and track improvements in patients admitted to mental health facilities focusing on aspects such as Vitality social and emotional functioning and general mental health and for more on this we're now joined by counseling psychologist at Life Health Solutions uh Sophia or safia uh Joseph and she joins us now via our video link uh Sophia thank you so much for your time this evening here on sabc news I mean a very important thing that I'd like for you to firstly outline for us and of course it is that mental health questionnaire 14 tool tell us more about it good evening and good evening viewers and thank you for the opportunity to tell you about mental health I think an Ever growing and more important topic in South Africa and globally so the mental health 14 questionnaire is one that is fairly widely used it's an international standard test it's a self-report tool right so it's designed to assess mental health symptoms and their impact on one's day daily functioning and I think you've spoken about the four dimensions that it measures against so things like vitality and how energetic and and and fatigued the person might feel their social functioning so how their uh physical or their emotional problems might impact on their normal everyday social activities it also looks at things like role functioning so their emotional functioning and how this might impact on work right and other daily activities and then other General mental health related issues right so the symptoms of depression or anxiety or any kind of uh emotional regulation control issues that the person might have and it's really important that we understand how mental health impacts on us on a daily basis because early intervention is key so the more the earlier we find out how somebody is feeling on that mental health Continuum of whether they're excelling and thriving or whether they're in crisis the better we'll be able to intervene and the earlier we'll be able to render care and talking about that uh one would also ask you know in what way is uh MH q14 tool um effective uh in terms of assessing a patient outcomes particularly uh looking at mental health issues so there are a number of benefits I think that despite the fact that it's a 14 item questionnaire so it's quite brief um it does provide quite comprehensive coverage when you look at the dimensions that I've mentioned but I think in addition to that it is patient centered so it's very much a self-report tool and it empowers patients to provide their own perspectives on what their mental health is and that leads to more accurate and meaningful data so interventions can then be based on what person is going through as opposed to what the clinician might think um you know and interpret their symptoms to mean and it's quite efficient right so it's quite quick to complete and I can tell you that in our u in our mental health facilities so whether it's through the Life Health Solutions employee wellness program or whether you're looking at our our inpatient facilities so the life mental uh rehab uh sorry the mental health and the rehab facilities what we do is that we administer it right at the beginning so uh pre-admission and then again once the person just before the person is discharged so we're able to offer continuous K it's endtoend care and we're able to ascertain how important this is from a patient experience point of view in addition to the clinician experience and I don't know if maybe you can take it a bit more uh further and a step further in terms of you know when it comes to patients taking this questionnaire what have you found as uh you know the commonalities uh in a number of uh people suffering uh from mental health what do you think are the contributing factors um that you have managed to find from this uh questionnaire yeah I think that I don't think it's any surprise when we look at what we're going through through these days the escalating food prices fuel prices and what people are experiencing on a day-to-day basis our a large target audience within the lifealth solutions is employees at work and when we look at things like well job insecurity burnout uh work life balance issues all of these Trends are picked up in that tool that we use but also in our clinician experience and uh um the the interviews that we do with patients that people are really taking strain and this is impacting on their mental health and we want to address any kind of mental health issues before it gets to the point of mental illness and that's part of that mental health Continuum discussion and what other the strategies are then used you know to help some of these patients when it comes to mental health after they've taken this questiony to help them improve uh their lives M you know people need once they're discharged and and whatever the care might be whether it's at the mental health facility or even if it's outpatient care they need to feel equipped to return to work and their family lives post treatment right and that needs to be a combination of uh a practical strategies emotional strategies and social strategies so gradual reintegration I think is key so engaging with employers on a phase return to work plan often helps and any kind of workplace accommodation that needs to be provided so reasonable accommodations so flexible hours or modified duties for example I think skilled development is really important in how people understand what it is they're experiencing and the dos and don'ts on a very practical level and then emotionally speaking I think uh counseling therapy support groups um one-on-one counseling that builds somebody's resilience that it's not simply about uh bouncing back it's about bouncing forward so once we deal with adversity we need to understand how we can help the person understand their new version of themselves and how they can cope with that and then of course family and and social support is key so family members also need to be a part of that treatment regimen because they need to understand what uh their family members might be going through and what treatment might be necessary and the role that they have to play and the same from a community point of view and I think all of this is key if we are going to break that stigma around mental health it's really difficult when um somebody is trying to their best to reintegrate into work and home and what they get from the people around them is a lack of understanding understanding of what they're going through yeah and perhaps what is your advice uh you know to South Africans uh who may not know that they are suffering uh from mental health what do the symptoms look like and how do they present uh themselves so that you know they can try by all means uh to you know reach out to someone and get the necessary help yeah I think that we should all be doing an internal check-in so some introspect action um and in the same way that from a physical health point of view if I had a sore throat and a runny nose and I was feeling a bit under the weather I would reach out to a doctor I would go and see my GP and to say that I'm not feeling very well and and what could I do from a mental health point of view we need to do those internal check-ins to see whether it's something whe whether we're feeling on top of our game because too often what happens is that people procrastinate when they're not feeling well they hope that tomorrow will be a better day or the people around them might say just think positive thoughts so being in tune and in touch with what we're feeling and limiting the negative selft talk this expectation that every day is going to be a great day I think we need to realize and cut ourselves some slack that it's okay to not be okay and that when we're feeling that way that we reach out for help whether that's initially to a family member or a confidant that you trust perhaps at work it's a colleague or your line manager or maybe it's a professional and realizing that just because you're not feeling okay and you reach out to professional does not make you weak it makes you human because anything that comes at the cost of our mental health is too expensive all right uh sfia thank you so much uh for your time uh this evening that is is safia Joseph she is a counseling psychologist just giving us there her insights in terms of that very important questionnaire it's called the mental health questionnaire 14 and is a tool to help uh many deal with the effects of uh Mental Health

1sNm6nofFPI,BREAKING NEWS: Tito Mboweni dies at 65,2024-10-12T21:22:36Z,54465,good evening we begin with breaking news this hour former Reserve Bank governor and Minister of Finance Tito Titus bweni has passed away according to a statement from the family he died in a Johannesburg Hospital on Saturday night surrounded by his loved ones the family has requested privacy during this difficult time as they cope with the profound loss further details will be shared in the coming days all right let's now cross on over to our politics editor lamb and he joins us now via our telephone live linei of course uh you know very shocking news coming in this afternoon are you just as shocked as I am well very good evening to you the viewers is this is quite shocking I mean we never expected this um and of course we never know um when someone will pass on but obviously for someone as um healthy and Lively as the former Minister and the former Governor of The Reserve Bank it is quite shocking I mean many South Africans since he left office I office I used to him really cooking making jokes and they'll make fun of that and I think that's what we've got used to him outside of his office um now that he's no longer I mean he was no longer a government official to hear news of this nature and it's quite a shock what do we know so far M when it comes to the details surrounding uh you know his death I mean the family statement saying here that you know the passing uh comes after a short illness it seems as if he hasn't been sick for a while I think that's why we are all shocked because we we really haden't had I mean anything um as I've said I mean other than him being before Minister being the governor of The Reserve Bank um I mean he was someone who was very uh joyful very engaging particularly on act because uh we we got used to him really we got used to his private lives particularly that of um cooking and sometimes he would make um the comments about the the national issues sometimes he would make it in a jular way whether it relates to his whether he's complaining about MK which has eaten into the party whether he would be wanting to perhaps having a meeting with malama to discuss a number of issues I think that's the kind of person that outside of who he was in terms of his politics and and and just to um just before you go to bed you hear news of this nature without hearing anything about his illness um and of course the family has clarified that it was short illness and then I guess that's why it's it's even a shock to them and of course to all South Africans I mean yeah it's it's quite a loss given the kind of a person he was I mean he was one of the person Z Who was appointed as a minister I think a labor Minister very very young and from there he became the governor of The Reserve Bank and I for two times and then he went out and then he he came back as the Finance Minister and you recall that when he was was brought back as the Finance Minister that's when had to leave uh the office because there were issues around the gos I think the president the current president president Raposa I think wanted someone who would be able to really fill into that into those shoes and get the work done so and then was able to do that and then of course at some point then expressed that so he would want to to retire from public office and then he was gred that wish when the president Shu so it was it is really um something that is really set for South Africans and a great great great loss and Z maybe let's talk about his lost in in government and something that you touched briefly on and that's his tenure as the Finance Minister from 2018 until 2022 I mean what kind of Legacy do we talk about particularly when we look at his ATT tenure as a finance minister you know um what what what we are busy speaking with now about now there's this thing called the two-port system that I mean I was just reading um how many people have accessed that and the kind of money that have been dispersed through the tort system that is that came up under him H before he left office so when he he he basically publicly said you know South Africans are struggling there but you know some of them do have resources to be able to manage um some of their difficulties so why can't we make a a a a a situation where they'll be able to somehow access some of their funds obviously the detail was not there at the moment but it is something that came from him and I think is one of the great legacies if you look at the kind of response of those people who who went and accessed the the the two-port system and then the kind of money that has been dispersed already so and then of course there's a lot more and um even his style of leadership so it it was quite interesting so that's I was saying I mean to hear such news in such manner is really really a shocker let's also talk about his style of leadership particularly when he was Finance Minister and of course you know the position of the unions and uh The Stance he took uh particularly uh when it came to that three-year wage agreement and uh you know when the unions expressed their dissatisfaction uh with some of the decisions uh that he took particularly uh surrounding uh uh you know some of the deals that were signed uh when he was a finance minister yeah you you see uh um when he was still minister he was he was very forthright on on so many issues and I think perhaps and and then perhaps others would even it bordered on on on on arrogance that's how sometimes he would Express himself but I guess it was the nature of who he was and this is someone who understood I mean the kind of work that had been entrusted to him Ian even if you go beyond from his position as Finance Minister you know he was once the labor Minister and then from there then he was assigned the responsibility of being the res The Reserve Bank Governor so that does tell you that it's someone who had I mean High intellect I mean educated abroad quite clear in terms of what he wanted and of course I mean he had all he had his distractors um I mean like in life um everyone will have uh good things to be said about him or her but there will be those who may not necessarily be impressed about how you manage certain things but I think we can all agree that I mean former Minister boeni the former Governor of The Reserve Bank so was one of the very bright individuals whether as a minister or as a Reserve Bank Governor so whether you agreed with him on certain issues so it's neither he not there so the fact of the matter is that he understood the kind of responsibilities that were given to him and while you do highlight the fact that you know to some he came across as a very arrogant uh minister at the same time those of us who are on social media also got to experience a different side to him uh particularly when it came to his pid's uh loving cooking lessons which he often held on social media oh yes uh that was quite big um I think once he left public office he then got the time to really Express himself as an ordinary man not only the cooking EMB I mean who can forget his shoes those shoes that he wouldn't want I those B that he really wouldn't want to change and then and the social media was always on his on him to say well we can see and you you dress maybe better today but please change the shoes and then sometimes he will go for that ban he will exchange views he will say I've listened I'm not changing or I have Chang so he basically let us in in his life and we know his love for the pill CH and the cooking and South Africans really weigh in on that aspect and some sometimes would advise him so how we should do it and all those things and how he used to put the onion and stuff like that I mean the fact in that we are able to speak about this is because once he left public office he really let lose in terms of his private life particularly what he wanted to do and I think that's always been um perhaps his wish to also not just appear as someone who's Minister but someone who also is just an ordinary human being even when I I remember when I think certain privileges were taken away from him I think he was at the airport and when he complained to say ah now that I'm not the minister so I'm not able to go I think to to the lounge something like that and then people were saying wow you are so intitled so and and and you could sense that sometimes he enjoyed that to say okay I'll just speak my mind it doesn't matter what people were saying I'll just speak my mind and then people will just have to deal with it so maybe I guess that is the part perhaps about AR where it would come in but generally I think the four minutes he was I mean appeared like a a very genuine somebody in doing whatever he was doing whether public or private all right I thank you so much uh uh for your time
xsyn7qEiNNo,Poultry I Proposed benefits of eliminating VAT on chicken products: Francois Baird weighs in,2024-10-12T20:55:55Z,313,according to fair play founder franu Bard removing value added tax from chicken would be a lowcost social program and job Creator the poultry industry has highlighted the need and lowincome households for affordable meat protein it argues that the elimination of that would result in the growth of the industry the growth of the economy and address the important issue of child Mal nutrition Fran bad joins us now for more on this conversation and he joins us via our video link Fran thank you so much for your time this evening here on sabc news I mean efforts are underway uh to have uh you know the vat being removed on chicken or some chicken products maybe just tell us what is the thought process behind this well it's very important because if you look at the latest HRC the human Sciences research Council survey uh that was released in August and has recently been officially launched by Minister John stean uh South African households uh are insecure 63.5% of households are food insecure of these 175% are severely food insecure and 26.7% experience moderate food insecurity it doesn't mean that South Africa is food insecure there's enough food being produced in South Africa but it means that there are enormous numbers of people without access to the right nutrition and of course uh animal protein is vital in this process and I mean should we see the removal of that on chicken and some chicken products I mean what will this mean particularly for poverty stricken homes because it seems as if that's where uh this school of thought basically comes from particularly at a time where it said that you know it can also address the issues around malnutrition in children if you take into account that in 2018 when we first launched our campaign for vatf free chicken 27% of children under five were stunted meaning they did not have fully developed brains and bodies and if it weren't turned around before the age of five they'd be like that for the rest of their lives we are we were literally starving our future well it's gotten worse far according the to the hsrc 28.8% of children under five are currently malnutrition uh are currently uh stunted this is simply unacceptable it's the wrong Trend and the only shortterm immediate solution that might be uh afforded is to make that free chicken a reality particularly for poor households and therefore we think it should be aimed at those products that lowincome households focus on what is the poultry uh uh sector saying about uh these efforts to have a vat removed from chicken and chicken related products in our conversations with them uh the poultry industry has confirmed to us firstly that they are putting together uh a formal uh presentation to government to ask for vat free chicken on certain products uh we think it will mostly relate to chicken feed ofal and uh and and chicken that's frozen not all chicken will be there and that is because they are also focused on families that cannot afford uh chicken and chicken meat and remember that pregnant mothers need this as well and so this is a vital vital effort for South Africa's Health but particularly for the future of South Africa's children and of course this also has a ripple effect uh because I mean some of the experts say that it can also allow for things like job creation and also to improve the state of our economy maybe give us a bit of insight there in terms of how this can be done uh if you know we remove that of some of these chicken related products oh it is vital remember that uh poultry is the largest Agri agricultural sector it is highly competitive so you are hardly supporting an industry that's not competitive they're already amongst the five top five or six most competitive poultry Industries in the world what what you're looking at is by lowering and removing that on certain chicken products you might actually increase the take up of chicken by about 10% this may uh result in thousands of new jobs not only in poultry but remember the poultry operations are mostly in rural areas where unemployment is at its highest and social problems abound due to unemployment and so this is a a vital social economic uplift that the country requires and in terms of this application this uh uh that will be brought before government or Parliament how far is this application uh to have uh this uh vat being removed uh from chicken related products we understand that the application is quite far developed and that in fact uh it's a matter of weeks before it will be presented to government we also believe that the matter has already been discussed at cabinet and and that the government itself is taking a very close look at how to move this issue forward of course we understand that the fiscal needs to be cautious and therefore I think it's very sensible to provide that free or vet relief to those chicken pieces uh used by lowincome households it can be assisted by making sure that those companies from countries that have dumped Chicken in South Africa pay the levies that they are due because they have broken the rules and therefore they need to pay their extra levies and this will help the country as well to pay for that free chicken all right francha thank you so much for your time and for that Insight that is uh francha Bard he is uh from fair play and he's the founder talking to us there about some of uh you know the proposals which have been made and that will be presented finally before government of course to have that being removed from some chicken related products for

of BMT and you can see that given given any team in front of them and and them in the right frame of mind they could beat any team in the world but the coach has expressed concerns though that if it continues that it doesn't get game time at his Club it might affect his bafana bafana chances do you see that happening also do you understand where the coach um is coming from yeah definitely I think as a leader and as someone that has achieved so much uh he's come to see these things in in in in the past uh where the player does not get much game time but he gets to play in his national team and it affects him because he's going to obviously be trying his level best to get up to speed with the the fellow teammates and that could be a stumbling Bo for us and if Deo doesn't get much game time at is at Club level it's going to hamper his chances of even being in the national team and I like that that's fairness that's something that uh World football is is about you know if you're not playing at your Club level how can you play for your national team okay let's talk about Tana though 50th cap for him 10 years after his debut he might not be grabbing the headlines because he didn't didn't get a goal last night but how good was he and how good has he been since Hugo Bruce finally picked him for bafana bafana listen there was talks of him oh his legs are gone he can't make it in fcon he didn't have a good start opener I don't know I can't remember exactly the game that he had the first game that we played in fcor listen that guy is something else we'll never ever see a player like ton and I had the the the opportunity to play against him and what a humble soul I think um it's just a little bit too late for him now to say that he'll play the next World Cup but I do definitely want to see him you know just Dawn the jersey of of of bafana bafana and what he's doing at his age phenomenal the it goes without saying he's one of the best players and for me I regard him as as as as a legend because when he gets onto the field everybody the kids of today the seniors that have played with him on or watch him play past and present actually Marvel and every time that he touches the ball every time he's on the field is something else is phenomenal and we cannot talk about the defense when we have you Morgan Gold they must also be happy with the clean sheet especially because the team had been conceding goals recently which is uncharacteristic of this bafana um bafana team so you must have been pleased with the with the clean sheet but the coach said in the week that they're going to try and defend differently now um did you see any of that yesterday in look credit must go to to the guys firstly uh they did a phenomenal job I think the game against Uganda was a a wakeup call uh they got it early they saw their blanders they fixed it up um you know the game of football is is is a teacher and they they learned their lesson they went back to the drawing boards uh what the current baana baana is doing right now they they taking lessons that games that they just played and and and taking that information that data and using it into the next game and for me these these crop of players are are doing something so special like if you look at just o medas if you look like dley yeah K even Gana himself you know uh take nothing away from from the players that uh then you you have class on the side you have bu you know not only that you have de in front of them that's that's and and the guy in the goals the captain the man of the moment and I want to take you back um there's a game that ronon was playing I don't know if it was his first game he got five goals po him Brazil he comes back in his own backyard 10 years later he makes sure he keeps a clean sheet they score five what a memorable moment what for me people take it for granted that and I I had the the the the pleasures of speaking to him after that game where I told him listen it's football this is this is a step stepping stone for you you can only get better and you can only get stronger look now he's a nominee for one of the greatest Awards uh it it just you know my my I'm I'm even having Goosebumps right now speaking about him because I know where it started for him and he even said to me you know the five that they put past me this is only the start oh the world is about to see me and look what he's doing phenomenal things my head must go off to him and his resilience his belief in in contining trying to be the best version of himself and helping everybody around him and it goes without saying he helped my career so U hat must go off to him uh Ronin always used to say one is one even in Hong Kong number one is number one and and clearly he's number one and he shows us there are no shortcuts in football thanks Morgan it's been a pleasure talking to you always great hearing you on sabc radio and sabc TV keep up thank you so much and it's always a honor and a pleasure uh stay well till we meet again my brother legend of the South African game Morgan Gold there
tywjB541QYI,Hockey I Dirkie Chamberlain celebrated as a South African women's hockey legend,2024-10-12T19:16:47Z,306,we'll move on to hockey now because Dei chamain is a celebrated South African women's hockey Legend not just a player and she's just retired from international hockey after the Paris Olympics in France having played more than 250 matches in a career spending 18 years she's joining us here on sports live all the way from the Netherlands to look back at this glittering career and there she is good evening from us on Sac DKI and I hope you're well and thank you for speaking to us tonight good evening and thanks for having me on the show thank you how do you firstly what prompted the decision to retire how do you wake up and know that okay you are done here with international hockey um no it's definitely not just a wake up um um it's come a long time and um I think a lot of people say you just know and I've always questioned that I'm like how do you just know but it actually is true you just know when the time is right and uh I feel very content with my career and what I have achieved and what I've given back to my country and um this is the moment where I just feel um yeah I think it's really good for the youngsters to take to take over and they're ready so um I leave sa hockey in their hands and I'm very excited about it for them so I know it's time to uh let it go it's a career that has spent almost 20 years how do you look back at it yes it's um it's longer than I thought it would be but um I'm very very proud of of what I've achieved I'm very proud of the length that I've endured and that my body's been able to uh to stick with me and um I look back at many many memories playing with um a lot of uh Legends of the game over the time um I look back at um many achievements that team has achieved so um yeah just proud and um happy for where SA hockey is going you've played Olympic games you've played World Cups Commonwealth Games Africa games what are some of your highlights then of this International career Dei some highlights would definitely be the Olympic Games I think that's a pinnacle for any athlete so London 2012 was my first Olympic Games and I've got very fond memories memories like scoring my first Olympic goal against Argentina um that was very special for me but also I think memories of also tough times people don't always see that but how we've had to qualify through tough times for these um events and uh yeah getting that qualification those are really good memories for me and then obviously Paris that's just one that stands out so much and I'm so grateful that I could uh finish my career there well sometimes you've qualified and not been able to go to the Olympic Games that must also be a big disappointment though that is definitely that was probably one of the the biggest lows uh throughout my career I think for many um of the other athletes that were part of that team as well so yes you work so hard um to qualify you train for years and then to hear that you've qualified but you're not allowed to go I think um that's a massive disappointment um yeah for all of us and hopefully that's not going to happen again in the future yes and there seems to be a little bit of a change of heart from sasc now why do you think that is is it are they getting encouraged by the team's performances now I really hope so and I hope that they can see how well we have competed now at Paris um as you know like we don't have the the preparation or the amount of preparation that the other teams that go to Paris Olympics have we don't have all of those financial backing and resources but we use what we have and to be able to come away with really close um scores and results again those other top teams I really hope that um you know sasco can look at that and that that's inspiring them and also I really hope that also us um inspiring the Next Generation so that's so important for sport so sport isn't to me only about the results and um being there but it's about how many people are seeing you there and the younger Minds that you are inspiring and what do you make of the Next Generation there were some youngsters in the team that went to to Paris there can they take this team forward very exciting um I'm so um excited for what's coming through the development and also the youngsters coming through having played with them we had a very young team at the Paris Olympic Games and even with that um the the less experience um we had there those girls showed up they stood their ground they really played phenomenal hockey and I think that group going forward if they can really stick together and um just keep that group um as the core of South African hockey going forward there's there's so much talent and potential so I'm so excited for the future and will will they need to get out decky like you've done you've played in England Belgium and the Netherlands just to get to get more experience and just to better um the their hockey also I think European hockey is really important um especially when you get to a point like an age in your in your career I think like the varsity cup hockey and all the the IP and stuff like that that's happening in South Africa is great for development but there comes a point at like 22 23 years of age where you really need to spread your wings and go over to Europe because the um coaching you get the experience with playing um top other players it's just something that you cannot um get in South Africa so it really is important and it helps with the growth yeah and and how how's the standard how different is the standard uh in Europe and here in South Africa how far behind are we yeah unfortunately there is quite a big gap and um as I say again it comes to a point like we have got a really good standard I think our school hockey is incredible and you get incredible um youngsters coming out of that group at school level going into University but the level is just so different when you come from when you reach that age of like 23 24 going up then really like the standard um just just explodes over here because you have so many Internationals that come and play at this league so the level that you are reaching I mean you're playing every weekend you're playing a game that's almost the same level as playing an international hockey game because you're playing all the Internationals so you just can't replicate that unfortunately in South Africa unless you have a league over there where it's something like um you know you're inviting a lot of Internationals to come there and you're having like U franchise teams then you could replicate it but otherwise the the difference is Big so I guess that will need financial backing because the other day we spoke to the coach before you guys went to the Olympics and the coach was telling us that he doesn't even get paid that's very true um as it's as it's been for a long time the hockey in South Africa um are struggling with financials and I'm really just hoping that um sponsors will step up and look at not only the results that we had at Paris but um look at the detail about how we actually competing without um a very big um how can I say um preparation as the other teams had so without all that preparation we are competing and we are really doing well at a stage where teams are on top of their game so looking at that you can see that there's so much potential and imagine what we can achieve if you actually do give us centralized program or we are training together every week in an out for six months before an Olympic Games at least you know so I think um that would be great yeah well what's not great is that we're not going to see you on the international scene anymore but how long do you think you can still um keep going for in club hockey well I think my body is feeling great still and um you know that's something that I'm really lucky with as a lot of people retire because of injuries but my body still feels great so I'll still be playing some Club hockey not at the highest level because um I really want to go more into my career as um off the field so um I'm going to do it at more of a of a lower level but I'm definitely still playing hockey and still on the scene and enjoying it and I think I can still go for at least 5 years wonderful and what's that career off the off the field yes career off the field I'm a personal trainer fitness instructor um and I work at a health and fitness club here in the ha okay wonderful Dei well you're a legend of the sport um you've put South African hockey on the map and it looks like you are happy that you've left the team in good hands here and there's some youngsters that can take it forward but thank you uh for the memories and what you've done for the sport here in the country despite um the challenges and we wish you all the best going forward thank you so much and thank you so much for having me on the show thank you Dei Chamberlain joining us all the way from the Netherlands there um where she is playing and also as you had also working as a fitness trainer there having gone to four World Cups uh two Olympic Games also all Africa games she's done Commonwealth Games 250 appearances 18 years in the national team doesn't get bigger and better than that for
hkiTcsHKVdQ,Cricket I SA women's team secures spot in ICC T20 World Cup semis,2024-10-12T18:58:57Z,2952,well from the disappointment in the boxing ring to much better news now in cricket because the protas women have comfortably beaten Bangladesh by seven wickets to top their group as the chase for a semi-final sport heats up at the women's T20 World Cup South Africa restricted the opposition to 10643 and Chase down their target with 16 balls remaining and to help us look back at the performances we have roped in cricket journalist or Sports journalist and analyst and commentator the award-winning kisaku to give us some perspective good evening from us um Kano and thanks for speaking to us again tonight uh good evening T good evening to the viewers another good performance here by the team how do you sum up today's showing against Bangladesh probably could have bettered a bit faster um if you look at there's a significant rat race with regards to the N Run rates that gone six points they done playing they've won three lost one the N Run rate is positive 1. 382 the issue now is that the w um who still have to play England their is 1 1.78 so now they are heavily reliant on one um England beating Scotland then beating the wests to qualify um so look they've done what they could I mean um they could have lessened the margin of defeat um From manova's perspective against England but in the other games they pretty much did what they needed to do probably in the West Indies and the Bangladesh successes um they could have chased a bit faster because this is a group that looks like it will come down to run rate Africa now I mean um the three games that they were expected to win they won um the margins of the wins will be a concern but then again England the West Indies probably have the toughest game in that they still need to play England and I think England um will probably try to put big numbers over Scotland um to make sure that their run rate is their net run rate is very healthy so South Africa at the moment their net run rate is very good but one feels that they they they do need England um to win both their games and win they both their games comfortably to ensure that the West Indies fall out of the points race and um will they be looking at where they finish also number one and number two to to basically avoid the other teams in the in the other group well there's nothing to avoid because if they finish first they'll play India they'll finish first regardless of where they finish they'll play they'll play one of Australia and India um there's just no way of getting out of that I mean look I mean New Zealand probably will still have a CHS um should they beat Pakistan look it actually becomes interesting that um you see actually India I'm have a lot to gain from from from from tomorrow's results in shs if they lose they're at the mercy of the of of the New Zealand Pakistan result um so actually now for India um qualifying for the semi-finals actually not guaranteed they actually need to win and win quite comfortably to keep New Zealand at B Because New Zealand um do have a game against Pakistan which also um could go either way they beat Sri Lanka quite comfortably um to actually make their run rate quite quite healthy so Australia pretty much home and host but for for India and New Zealand um there's there's quite a r race for that particular final spot overall though how do you look at the team's performances in this group um this group stage starting with a 10-wicket win against the West Indies look it's been they've been a team in transition um the results weren't great leading up to the World Cup but they've put it all together um I didn't expect them to beat England and and that um unfortunate reality did play out but against the West Indies and against Bangladesh um they were very efficient um one could have thought that again batted faster in those games chased FAS in particular when you know what's at stake with the Run rate but for a team that's in transition the team that has a an interim coach um the semi-finals are pretty much there for the taking but then again you OG just hope and wish that um England just make England just tis their boxes against Scotland and the West Indies to ensure that they at least reach semi-finals I suspect that with Australia's win South Africa probably will finish second and face the might of Australia and with the way yes Australia do have some injury warries but the manner in which Australia is playing now South Africa making the semifinals and playing Australia I do feel that that could be their end of the road but again this is T20 cricket I'm again also depends where they play um look if you looked at the surfaces in in Char and Dubai um they've been pretty difficult for batting there have been um some some reasonably big scores uh but they haven't been the they've been the exception rather than the rule yeah and overall though um it do you get the sense that it's been an or a team performance overall from the proas wom we've seen the openers get them off to a good start we've seen marizan cup with experience in the middle um trying just to step things up we've seen the Spinners also LED bya come to the party I guess that's always a crucial element in the World Cup where everybody's performing indeed I mean La is right up there with top Tak the tournament um Tasman Brit for example has hit the most boundaries in the tournament so it'll tell you that there's always been a chip in here a chip in there bits and pieces performance a bits and Pie performance but I think you know when you get to the playoff stages should soua get there we hope that they do get there because one think that they really played well enough to get there um they will need a stand out and a very quick batting performance from at least one of the top four um I think Tasman britz has probably showed the most Ingenuity the most uh impetus um at the top but again it all depends on who they're playing the semifinals as things stand um should Australia win tomorrow Australia will top that group and then they'll be probably South Africa if if if England win their two games um that will mean probably South Africa they have to face Australia so look they will need if should they play a team like Australia um in the semi-finals they going to need a very very big performance from one of the stand up players to win well has been one of the standout performers here how has she managed to turn it around considering that she was she was battling for form leading up to this world cup lower surfaces changes of pace I think what she's done so well um is that she's changed up her Pace very well um used the lengths beautifully use the crease beautifully when she's bowling so I think I guess I guess the conditions played a role uh but I think once she landed up on those wickets and saw how much assistance she get um from those pitches um she just turned it up she just turned up very well but I think the key part is that she's found the length and line very early and that's allowed her to to vary her flight to VAR di to VAR turn and that's made a quite and quite quite a very a very important option um for South Africa and just finally before the tournament what would have been the expectations um of of of this team considering that they reached the final at the last T20 World Cup but you also mentioned that they have an interim coach now probably semi-finals you look at that group probably would have given them semi-finals if they were in the other group then I think would have been a different story um but I think when you looked at that group you realized that um there were two guaranteed wins against Bangladesh and Scotland and probably a virtual final againsts fortunately they had that game up front won that one reasonably comfortably and outside of the England loss um they made sure that they they they dispense with Bangladesh and Scotland to ensure that at least they've made their win end of the bargain um I think semi-finals would have been minimum and then getting the final been a bonus okay well let's let's hope that they've done enough then to make it to the semi-finals after winning three of their group matches there thank you Kaku for joining us always a pleasure talking to you thank you T yeah the award winning sa Sports journalist of the Year kanaku giving us some insight on what's happening at the women's T20 World Cup in the UAE the proas now are waiting to see what happens in the other matches to confirm their ticket in the semi-finals
3RVYyux6uGA,Dr Mathole Motshekga on introduction of African spirituality,2024-10-12T18:48:39Z,3335,"the tension between African indigenous spirituality on the one hand and religion on the other hand is an age old contention making sense of this is auth academic Dr M MOA who speaks to us now Dr M MOA has published a book to this effect Dr mucha thank you so much for your time I really do appreciate it are African indigenous spirituality and religion irreconcilable to the extent that you have to choose one over the other and they cannot at all times coexist the book was not published by me it's the book published by Imon J hard and the book was launched at unisa yesterday and I was invited as one of the panelists uh the what comes out is that uh it is no longer a choice between uh African spirituality and uh other spiritualities the simple truth is that the West was given 2,000 years uh to run the world and for that 2,000 years they used violence Wars and so on and also abused religion uh for political purposes now their 2,000 years has expired and that expiry is actually marked by the war in the Middle East so that for us means the death or demise of secular religions which they were imposed on the world now from 1994 to the year 2994 is what we can Define as a African Millennium that Millennium will be governed by African spirituality so the launch of the book by Imon had was historic because it launches the African Millennium yeah it's interesting that you mentioned there that part of the Imperial Conquest Arsenal has been religion as a tool religion is ubiquitous in African life it is almost uh inextricable in African life in most senses given that church has become a place of community for us but also church has become a place of organizing and in our own Liberation struggle a place to organize for the purposes of Liberation when we talk about the contentions between religion and African indigenous spirituality is there enough scholarship out there that makes sense of the adaptation of religion into uh African indigenous spirituality and how they today coexist uh cohesively in African life you will understand that when our people IMA in uh the struggle the first phase of that struggle was to say was to break away from missionary religions and uh uh established in what are called in African initiated churches uh predominantly the Ethiopian movement and our people made a clear distinction between what they call in which were colonial religions or missionary and in so what we are saying is that for 2,000 years in were dominant and now they have turned out to support violence Wars and now are rising because you know one old lady called Nanda said when she was hanged in 1896 by the rhan forces that uh the bones will arise I will come back to lead The Liberation struggle and the struggle in Zimbabwe was led by that lady called Nanda and the struggle was called chimura which means the war of the ancestors and that War of the ancestors was then led by the spiritual people so all that we are saying is that in now have their time and our people should listen to the voice of their ancestors yeah Ethiopia is a very interesting case study then you brought it up so I I want us to double click in on that is there a textural difference between how Afric an in Ethiopia a country never having been colonized relate to religion and spirituality versus the rest of the continent that had been victims and subjects of Conquest you see what is generally not understood when we say Ethiopia was never colonized the modern Ethiopia is abisinia uh the catic people from Yemen Arab I conquered the kushites who were indigenous Africans and then destroyed ancient Ethiopia with its headquarters in Mar so it is not entirely historically true that Ethiopia was not colonized Ethiopia ABIA which was a province of ancient Ethiopia also known as Nubia was colonized by Arabs and Semitic people from Arabia and Yemen and then they established a Semitic Kingdom of which came to be known as the kingdom of salassi and that's why the kingdom of highy you know link themselves King Solomon who is Jew they don't link themselves to Africa but historically they supported the African struggles and that's why H African leaders I identify with ABIA which is mod Ethiopia yeah Dr M thank you so much for your time this evening Dr m m an author and academic"
pzvRQJ0dfTM,Boxing I Review of Sivenathi Nontshinga's title defence: Hekkie Budler weighs in,2024-10-12T18:45:49Z,679,but firstly we have to start off with the boxing news it was a disappointing day for South Africa as Japanese boxer masamichi yabuki won the ibf junior Flyway title from South Africa cinga with a ninth round technical knockout earlier today the former WBC light flyweight Champion yabuki knocked ninga down once in the eighth round and twice in the ninth round before the referee stopped the fight there in Japan in Nagoya and ning's loss in his first title defense season drop now to 13 and two with 10 Knockouts and to look back at this fight and ahead to another one that's coming up on Monday we are joined by a former stable mate of cinga but most importantly a former world champion hey bad is here with us in studio great to see you um hey good evening and thanks for joining us well it's it's it's weird thanks for having me it's it's nice to be here but also not nice because of what happened to C I'm not happy about it sad about it but that's boxing it's love what went wrong though because I think everybody was surprised by the that the performance it was not what would expect from a S on Jinga I think it was the power he knew about the power this guy's got what he's one one one fight on points the rest of he Knockouts he hits extremely hard he knocked out kirro he's ex extremely good fighter get great punch I don't know I think he just could not get into his Groove was from round one he just couldn't loosen up couldn't let let his hands go but that's boxing sometimes you have an off night it might have been off night it's it's life it's not not good to see not good to say it wasn't his best KN you talk about the power how much of what happened in monteo would have been at the back of his mind when he was knocked out in the second run by Adrian turel before he won his belt again yeah it might have been Cel was not a puncher if you look at his reg I think he had three or four wins by knockout at that stage Yuki is a puncher yeah he goes in from round to try and knock you out every punch he throws he tries to knock you out is a traditional normal Japanese fighter that's what they do but I don't know it might have been a problem um I don't want to make excuses for him I haven't spoken to him yet um I'm giving him time cuz I like to to I've been through it you need that little bit of break before you can process everything but it might have been a problem um it might not have been it might just have not been a good night for him it might not have just felt it it happens and God willing he can he can come back and and and be a world champion again you talk about the power as a former boxer yourself if if you feel your opponent's power early in the round does it play at the back of your mind also then are you wory do you become reluctant as the fight goes on because we could see that he was not himself he wasn't fighting on the front foot like we expected him to as the champion yeah it it does happen um it's happened to me before I when I for chero as well the first round I felt his power yeah but I think it's everybody is a bit different because like you said he got knocked out at in Monte Caro that was still on his mind might have still been and that also plays all plays into it um and he wasn't himself like watching these replays on on the screen now he just was not himself he didn't pressure I heard Colin screaming in from from the side pressure pressure stay on him stay on him work and and he was just not getting into his Groove that he wasn't letting his hands go it was not the the the special one I know to be honest with you but that's boxing it does happen what what would have been the game plan or how do you plan for for a big puncher like that well you you keep your hands up and I think the game plan for this fight was to walk him down stay in on him stay on him and and and work throw your punches CU that's what he had to do but just not get hit defend yourself at all times which he was doing in the start he wasn't getting hit with a lot of shots he was just not working back throwing punches back I think that would have been my game plan stay on him and throw a lot of punches and defend yourself when you get out of the angles when you move away the shots so you can't get countered I don't know what to wrong honestly I don't know what went wrong yeah we certainly did not see the ca that we know when we expect I mean this defense against Yuki and and many people are also asking the question now of why would a champion go and defend away from home what leads to that uh easy answer money it's it's easy plain simple um how much would he get paid in South Africa in R compared to their way is getting paid in dollars it's financially just makes sense to go and fight that side it just works out better I know this it happened to me it it works out better does it not put you at a disadvantage though as as as the champion and you're fighting in the challengers background and he's going for your title here it it most definitely does but then again if you look at a fighter like Uncle Brian Mitchell yeah fought all his almost all his defenses always the fence Who overseas and you won them so it's not impossible but y it is harder most definitely everything against you the crowds against you the crowd boo you a bit Japan Japan's a bit different but some countries they boo you but y it is different stepping into their their their background the a place that they used to they know what to expect what's going on is very hard very difficult but if you're a world champion you have to get used to those circumstances and and work through them and you know this team very well obviously having worked with with Colin and c and and and and and and the rest of the team how badly do you think they taking this one hey from personal experience I've I've lost um where Colin has cried and I haven't where Colin got more upset than me I'm so I know Colin takes it l he he every fighter he trains he takes he takes all of us under his wing and I think he takes the losses harder than we do that's part of it if he loses if if we lose he loses that's what a lot of people don't don't understand with boxing if you're the manager or the trainer and your fighter loses the next fight you're not going to make as much money you're not going to be that that exposed you're not the world champion anymore so don't have to pay that much so the the the people who make money from you the train and the manager they're also losing money so it FS everybody around you and it's it's not a nice feeling it's it's it it's heartbreaking to go through that and also he was South Africa's only credible world champion now we don't have a credible world champion we do we've got a WBC oh Kevin by the way a couple of days ago he was elevated the third or fourth WBC champion in our history congrat congrats kin good result for you but yeah it's it's not his fault that he got elevated to the champion they they were busy negotiating a fight the guys said now I want to move up yeah so he's the champion for a reason he was a champion in waiting and congratulations to him yeah he stepped up and he's been given the title of the WBC brid weight after Lawrence okol moved aside so Kevin Lena is the champion um so what is the way back now for re n he's bounced back before he's lost his title he's gone to Mexico um to to win it again now how would the road um to to to Redemption look like now well it all depends on the contract he signed if the contract says a rematch CLA then he'll have the rematch like he did when he lost to K I never had that a luxury of having rematches yeah um but yeah things like that happen if he doesn't get the rematch get two two or maybe three just nice good getting back into the group fights but I believe they still a figh in there I believe he can still come back what how old is he he's a youngster he's a kid still child um okay me saying that yeah but in my eyes yeah and yeah and I believe he can still come back he's a good fighter he trains hard he puts everything into it so I believe he can still come back but it's not all all doom and gloom though for the team because there's another South African boxer in Japan Puma cfu will be fighting on Monday for the WBA title um how do you fancy his chances against Co Tanaka I believe I think he's going to win really it's going to be a hard fight don't don't get me wrong it's going to be a hard fight um but if I look at how can I say there there's there's a South African who fought a similar opponent yeah to Nagatani and the South African actually stopped this opponent that he beat on points and kafu is a better fighter in my personal opinion so I think K beat him out boxes him and he beats him even though it's his first crack at a world title and his first fight with C Nathan also I actually spoke to someone else as about to ask me the same question they thought I was n but I honestly think he's going to win I think Ka is going to pull it pull something out of the bag and he's going to get the win for us he's going to Japan for the first time he was actually here two weeks ago he's even um going overseas for the first time um in his life he sounds very confident but what can he expect in Japan as somebody who's been there and fought the numerous times like like I said ear if you go to some countries like I when I went to Mexico the people were booing me they were they were like threatening me where in Japan it's a completely different different side those people are so respectful and so nice to people that you'd almost think that you that they're coming to support you I promise you um but you you'll you'll feel the the pressure on it there the the the the time bases and things that the the Japanese people follow like if they say it starts at 11: 10 to 11 you're standing ready to walk to the ring it's everything is time based that's something to get used to but it's so well organized and they look after everybody that's part of the team um and he I think he left a day after them left so he's he's a climatizer is ready I think he's going to love it I think I love Japan when I was there it's an amazing country it's not South Africa don't get me wrong but yeah I think he he'll love it and he'll enjoy it and and what do you like about him about pum laaf that you're tipping him to win this WBO Junior Bantam way title well if you look at the he beat one of my my close friends first a draw and then he beat we we were in the national team together and I believe chck is a very good fight in my person opinion he's extreme to be I World Champ at the stage of his career where he is now it's incredible and K beat him and you have to be a good fighter to beat Jackson he is Crafty and a very good fighter but also seeing him in the gym the things he does the work he puts in how he listens to what Colin tells him he wants to win this he's ready and I think he's going to win okay my money is on kafu to win okay heck tipping kafu to bring back the WBO junor banto title before we let you go there's another big fight tonight in Saudi Arabia it's riat season two unbeaten Russians at betev up against Dimitri bivol betev 20 wins all by knockout here against the technician how do you see this one hecky um I I was leaning towards B Bev in the start then I watched some of their replays and I've seen them get knocked down both of them get knocked down in fights then I thought he might pull it out it's a 50/50 fight I think the first one to really land is going to win I honest you don't know I put my money on on better I think he's got the harder punching power but B's boxing IQ is so incredible I don't know it's a 50/50 fight it's can go either way but if you want a bet take the bet on the guys that all the Knockouts that 20 and0 that's he it's like a like a like a crazy the one thing I have to say age might be against him okay okay maybe the younger guy in Beil then could do it for hecky B but it's been great having you here hecky um we love your Insight and we're hearing in commentary here we love the path that you're taking un likey for but there still another chance for p Ka to come back home with the WBO Junior Bantam a title we wish him all the best he'll be fighting on Monday around midday South African time for
ppxCPsU5Eus,Future of Digital Identity in South Africa: Expert Martin Groenewald weighs in,2024-10-12T18:16:48Z,977,secure citizens on the future of digital identity in South Africa uh overview with a global identity crisis threatening to undermine economic growth and the safety of millions of South Africans urgently needs secure and Innovative identity Solutions let's talk to now a digital technology and Biometrics expert on this as we try to make sense of what potentially could be the new technologies that could Safeguard us Martin Koval is the chief executive for Global growth uh Martin good evening thank you so much for your time really do appreciate it when I log into my banking app Martin uh it uses my face recognition uh to gives me access and sometimes on a very odd occasion it asks me for my actual password and I may have to go through a two-step authentification process to be able to go in is that secure enough and has that become a legislated requirement when it comes to uh protecting the identity uh and the sensitive information of consumers uh Oliver and um thanks for having me and good evening to your viewers as well um look I think the the biometric on your app on your banking app verifying news about as as good as we we've got it um I don't think that it's it's always foolproof um but it it it really does help having the biometric on your app yeah is it an expensive piece of technology for uh for users to to have or at least for uh the administrators of platforms uh to administer uh so that their users can have peace of mind of that Safety and Security look I it's it's obviously all technology has a price but if you look at how much for um that um South Africa was targeted at you know we we are the third most targeted country for cyber crime in the world um you know just um in 2022 our fraud statistics um in terms of of um you know um identity theft Rose by 356 per. so anything we can do at the um we have to do as a country otherwise we we're just um staring into the bur and it's ordinary people that suffer um Oliver you know um people suddenly realize that they're owing money that they would never part of or or that suddenly they blacklisted and they didn't even know that they were um you know entering into a financial transaction so it is really a little bit of a crisis that that any kind of technology that we can use needs to be done yeah what are some of the biggest digital identity problems in South Africa well look I think in terms of of IDE identity it is mostly identity theft um I I think um and you know we we always look at the obvious we we think of of Home Affairs and and identities being stolen but that's not where it ends I think there are people's identities being stolen all the time and it's because we leave a paper trail so often in everything we do think about how many times you are asked to produce your identity or your driver's license and people keep copies all over the place um and and so we producing our identity so many times that it becomes really easy for people to actually take your identity and then go and and do a whole lot of financial transactions that you're not even aware of um and that then becomes yours to try and solve um in the end yeah with the Advent of AI and very specific L deep fakes uh that fear goes up do we have the necessary and requisite protective Technologies against that well I think that's what's exciting I think there's some emerging technology um we we doing some work in that space where you can actually use verifiable credentials that are stored in a in a blockchain and that can't be hacked um so I think I think the world is moving on and and what is nice about using Technologies like that and using verifiable credentials it puts People Like Us the consumers back in control of our identity so you can just imagine um you know your identity almost operating as if it was a wallet on your on your app on your phone then you can just go and produce that wherever you need it but the cool thing about it is it's not sitting on your phone it's actually sitting cryptographically stored in a blockchain so so it's not so easy for for the for the guys to get in there yes um you got to be careful when you on board people with deep fake and AI but the point is is at the moment every time somebody gets um on boarded by an institution they are have that threat um continuously but there are ways of solving it that's the good news on it yeah maral thank you so much for your time really do appreciate it Chief Executive Officer of global growth rather at secure citizen

in relation to how are they taking this incident because yesterday it appeared that the car belongs to this family as well that basically left eight people inside that car dead we'll speak to the family member who is the sister to the two three brothers that passed away yesterday for birthday SE 18 17 17 24 years for that was the sister of the three siblings that passed away in the crash yesterday she's briefing Us in relation to the incident that as the family they still set and shocked about this incident because they don't understand how did the in accident happened but in that uh night shell they also warning the members of the public to stop using the videos that are circulating on social media showing the siblings with alcohol packed alcohol in the Bas basically in the car as if they were going to the party yesterday part she's telling us that the party was in September when one of the siblings had a birthday but yesterday when this incident happened they were sober they did not have a because they were coming back from a study H basically it seems if they had a study camp that they had in one of the local schools here and at that time they were coming back and trying to deliver others so that they can get ready for a school we're now joined by the k andp transport M's bonisa to give us an update on this m good evening thank you so much for your time seven of the 33 passengers in question are critically injured do you have an update about their status at the moment your viewers at home indeed it can be confirmed that four have perished and we want to pass our condolences to the family but I'm sure we just have to strengthen our voice this is not a cable matter it's a m in which the driver who has without trgp and the bus didn't have the road worthy so it was unro worthy so it means something must happen to the owner of Holy Cross because it's something that we can't tolerate at this point in time it means that they were being driven as P Us by a walking cost in life and lit so it's not even recklessness and something to happen on that proc yeah let me see just to ask you to repeat that did you say that four of the passengers that were critically ill have now passed away no no no no I'm I'm saying I'm still confirming that those who are nothing have changed I was confirming that four died all that's what you refering no no no no so nothing has changed so far um from the passengers that have been uh injured in this have you been able to uh ascertain uh what their status is in far as far as their health those outside of the four that have passed away they're still in different hospitals and the doctors have not allow they going to update us because as you know that part of the pr they must check you must that even internal Bing so we're not yet allowed just to converse with them at a critical time because remains a sensitive matter we're then going to update probably tomorrow so for now we're still talking to Medical practitioners just to follow the process MC do you have a traffic report about what had caused the bus to overturn amongst other things the tires were so ter we warn even the breaking system that's part of as I've already highlighted that we have confirmed that even the co it's something that is shameful that the bus had a CO because how do you approve a bus with terrible the tires were in bad condition and I've already highlighted that the driver didn't have the PTP which is among other key matter you can't operate if you're going to carry passengers without so I think we are there that particular time and ifn C must do something I'm sure they will do the same I've already spoken to the premier because the shows that it was given a platform from M and we were aware as well and right time those in our centers who keep on issuing this illegally so the consequence because look what happen right now yeah let me see have you been ble to determine uh whether this is a commercial bus and if so who it belongs to belong to Holy Cross as I've already highlighted yeah own yeah have you gotten in touch with your owner not yet I think at the SP time just I'm saying on our side I've just said let us open a proper criminal case as opposed to be following other procedures which is why the driver must not face the cable we just have to open a a case in this regard same thing applies to the owner I'm sure that's the same exercise that we must do we are not going to negotiate or talk with the owner because you understand and I don't think at this point in time you would have allowed his family or himself to be in that vehicle or in that bus I'm sure you have seen the pictures the glaring element it's something that could not happen it's so ped that it must not be on our road so it's something that is why we must act and we've talken about Z tolerance in the province ofal and we are painful that almost two days ago it was almost the same that to place exp to M yeah uh just the last question MC October also is transport Awareness Month the end2 has become a coffin a coffin as you had put it there earlier with various Road Carnes what is the province in a in 30 seconds if you can tell me going to be doing an uh road traffic awareness month a month is the of RTI so probably before you reach 100 kilom you must have seen a traffic officer on the road as a matter of awareness because in terms of s set shows that every hour you Beed if you've seen that the visibility more and more numbers you just have the recr came from the college they already on board the joint operation s say MDF and other forces are also traffic officers in our municipality they're also working Clos with us in towards the direction of the effective season yeah the MC thank you so much for your time really do appreciate it that is the ker and transport MC spum giving us an update there uh telling us that four of the 33 passengers in question here have earlier today perished uh while several remain critical and in difficult conditions
hpp-ZbioROI,Middle East conflict I ANC first deputy secretary-general Nomvula MonKonyane weighs in,2024-10-12T17:33:31Z,1907,"and welcome back to the full view thec first deputy secretary General who is also the chairperson of the international relations and cooperations subcommittee of thec has joined the community in laum where calls have been made for International Community to stop the ongoing conflict in the Middle East Israeli Defense Forces is continuing with its attack in Gaza Lebanon and Syria international news editor Sophie mcua is with nula mukan at the laum peace protest Sophie the protest is one that takes place in the context of ongoing conflict there uh what did did the ANC talk about where also the premier of The Province was present today well I spoke to the premier of hting Bazi earlier on after the walk H where I was asking him about the anc's resolve to continue to support Palestine and he pointed out that they will continue to do so because this was done by also their four Bears I'm talking here about the former South African president Nelson Mandela who indicated when he was inaugurated in 1994 that as long as Palestinians are oppressed uh that the whole world is still oppressed and he continued to uh ensure that wherever he was on multilateral fora he does point out to the plight of the Palestinians he has visited ramala we know that there's a huge statue at ramala You' recall that during the international uh court of justice Hearing in uh the Haag where I was the issue of uh what Mandela stood for on what he said also came out when South Africa presented its case before the international court of justice seeking intervention to stop the carage but since then in January we're talking about more than 40,000 Palestinians who have been killed particularly children and women and now we see that war now in Lebanon including Syria and therefore the whole region is very very tense I'm going to speak to the chairperson of the subcommittee of international relations at thec May who has just returned from uh uh mamb Beek where they observed elections in MOS Mena let's start with Mo how was it like thank you very much Sophie Moz was quite peaceful very interesting a few lessons to learn as well as um an appreciation of how all parties were able to adhere to the rules of um The Electoral commission and guess what we also noticed that in uh mozambik election day is a non- trading day the same companies that come from South Africa and that are objecting to the the election day not being a a trading day are actually adhering that side so that's another practice that you would have to look at there's a common Trend that South African companies when they are outside they do they behave behave and also implement the laws of that country but in our country it looks like they don't take thec in particular but the government of the day serious that's exactly the concern and hence was saying starting with the the banks um the various commercial uh uh businesses all of them were closed um and no one was actually making a big cabalo about it and they saying the law is the law and fin let's talk about what we are here for the plight of the Palestinians ANC has supported the cost of the Palestinians for quite a long time recently with the latest carage you put a spirit at IED even the government going to the icj but it looks like the war is not coming to an end we're quite concerned also now with the recent killing of 20 additional people just today I'm quite concerning over 42,000 peace loving people not soldiers ordinary civilians being killed by the Israeli apartate Army being bombed and all that including the moving into other neighboring countries and stuff it is quite concerning but you need to appreciate that we have actually started to move from protest to action the very H H process that is now before the courts but also the facilitation that we have seen done by the government of China bringing all the groups from Palestine together and the work that had started even previously under the leadership of President tabi it is actually now showing that the itself when we went to the court we were alone but today we can proudly say there are more than five other countries that have joined and there's also a demand that um South Africa Africa in particular must have a seat in the United Nations security Council and and lastly the work that has to be done with regard to famine and hunger we we are also working with the uh gift of the givers and other civil society formations to ensure that we put pressure because what is going to happen end of the month the only ruling the ruling will only happen possibly in a year or so we need to find interim interventions because we can't just say we have taken the matter to court we must now have social interventions taking place I have with me young uh Palestinians they were brought to South Africa by the gift of the givers what is your message um I'm very grateful and I'm happy that there's no war now there's no killing I just say like for she is going to read a message and you I'm very happy for being here and I really thank the South African government for getting us here and um and I'm very happy for the support that um South Africa is actually supporting Palestine and Gaza and inshah one day Palestine will be free Palestine will be free officials from the government in it will be free respected leaders thank you so much finally the issue of the Deputy chair of the subcomittee what happened and why this drastic step we we all can't explain exactly what led to the sitation but it was a misrepresentation of the African National Congress including the composition of the delegation and hence this decision that has been taken and from here as it has been announced by the Secretary General other due processes of the organization will take place it was an unfortunate occasion that actually tried to to undo the work that we have done and the relationships that we have invested on over time thank you so much that's why thec deputy secretary General ending the interview with the announcement yesterday that thec has decided to remove the deputy chair of the subcommittee of international relations Bella from that committee because he visited Morocco you know that Morocco has been a th issue for South Africa because of the tension between Morocco and saharawi you know that Algeria has been beging the saharawi people and therefore South Africa doing the same and visiting Morocco according to thec it was not done in proper channels back to you Studio thank you so much for that Sophie M coming to us live from Petoria"
7jdMU454K98,South Africa's National School Nutrition Programme under the spotlight:  Dasantha Pillay,2024-10-12T17:25:47Z,525,let's take you to this now the issues challenges and opportunities of South Africa's national school nutrition program are under the spotlight this is researchers experts activists and policy makers presented their experiences and insights as part of the Healthy Living Alliance two-day School food environment program joining us now is section 27 legal research Desa P Desa good evening thank you so much for your time appreciate it South Africa spends about 10 billion round a year on its National School nutrition program a program uh which was legislated in the late '90s to which we now see uh the benefits of from uh where we see the outcome the educational outcome of children who are able to go to school and not remain hungry it has come under the spotlight when the new minister of basic education had raised issues with regards to the procurement processes around the distribution of that 10 billion Rand was that part of the conversation that took place between researchers and policy makers in the conversation well thank you for having and firstly I I I just want to be clear um when we start this conversation that you noted this um convening that happened this past week and I was very fortunate to be part of it and the overwhelming consensus is that the nsnp is an amazing project it it really it really really does help South African children every single day um and the the purpose of the conference was not necessarily to undermine the project or the program but really to look at ways that the uh program can be optimized and to consider how how this program um will be developed so taking into account what the problems are but at the same time starting from the position that this is an amazing amazing program an Endeavor on the part of the South African government that has that where literally over 9 million children are fed yeah uh what are some of the ways in which researchers think that the program could be optimized particularly looking at provinces uh where food insecurity outside of the school environment is most exacerbated so some of the um the conversations varied um but some of the ideas that came through this convening and this convening was quite remarkable because it included members of Civil Society it included um um um act uh people who work in in the school nutrition uh National School nutrition program as well as members of of government and from the Department of basic education um the key themes that came out in my opinion is that we is is that um we need to do increased research so that um the budget aligns with the um with the needs that are actually required um in addition to that people spoke about transparency and wanting to know about exactly how the money that the treasury um um allocates for the nsnp is being spent importantly the nsnp is funded through a conditional Grant through the treasury and that Grant is ring fenced which means that money can only be spent on the nsnp and there was from from this broad Coalition of people who work and care about the nsnp there was a strong sense a strong sense and a strong call for transparency and accountability in terms of spending when it comes to the nsnp yeah where the conversations about how to make the national school nutrition program a lot more sustainable and perhaps even self-reliant when we look at what certain schools have been able to do by building and having food programs through uh Gardens that they have grown internally in the schools where some of the Learners in fact have taken those initiatives on themselves to reduce the cost uh the input cost rather of the schools nutrition program have there been conversations about scaling those so that the 10 billion Rand that is available through National treasuries appropriation bill becomes stretched out further so the idea of of localization and um and school and um and school Gardens um feeding Gardens did come up and it's an important part of the nsnp because when this project was was was set out it was set out as a program it's called the national school nutrition program and part of that was to include local suppliers so that communities could grow and develop and and um and um benefit from this program together how but I will also say that yes that is that that while that that stance my following statement exists at the same time the right to education and the right to nutrition in terms of the South African Constitution are interl and unlike other socioeconomic rights those rights are immediately realizable which means that they're not constrained by budgetary concerns or or um um yeah bi budgetary concerns raised by the state the state has an obligation to actually realize the right to education and the right to basic nutrition is has been developed has been stated to be part of the right to education in South Africa yeah part of the national school nutrition act exactly states that sentiment that the right to education and nutrition are inextricably link uh the thank you so much for your time and your insights really do appreciate it legal researcher at section 27
0gtAwKIsmD4,ANC | Obed Bapela faces backlash over Morocco trip:  Prof Sethulego Matebesi weighs in,2024-10-12T17:22:26Z,4172,and the deputy chairperson of the anc's international relations committee orer badela drew the ey of the party's deputy secretary General and the chairperson of the party's international relations committee nula mukan when he engaged the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Morocco under the pretenses of representing the party this came to light when the party's allies in neighboring rival Algeria informed the party of the engagement let's unpack this further with Prof set Mesi who is the head of Sociology at the University of the Free State Prof good evening thank you so much for joining us perhaps as context the starting point of our conversation should be about the tense relationship and the history of Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara perhaps tell us why that makes this moment so contentious hi good evening uh uh Ola and good evening to your viewers yes we all know the stun of the African National Congress and it's similar to what is happening in Israel where the African National Congress will always take the stance of those particular Nations that fight for self-determination and it's the same situation here West West Sahara has been fighting for self-determination for many years and the African National Congress STS has been a very sympathetic one towards uh that particular Nation in their fight uh for self-determination yeah when when thec or at least under the prenses of representing the party when OB B had engaged Morocco it seems he had given a Ted support on behalf of the party towards Morocco and its alleged claim over the Western Sahara Algeria is not too happy about this and they had reached out to thec about this um is thec hoping to be an interlocutor between Algeria and Morocco on this matter or has it chosen to just completely stay out of it and not choose sides no it's it's I don't think so this is to do with organizational issues organizational principles and we we're talking about a senior ANC member a highly experienced cater of the African National Congress who should know uh for me this is also more not about the stuns of the African National Congress but it's also about the internal Dynamics you have to tow the line and I think yeah I strongly believe that OB Bella have overstep uh you know because there are party processes uh such policy positions has to be articulated by perhaps the spokesperson of the African National Congress and seemingly went out in public to make pronouncement which seems to be completely against the stuns of its own party let alone uh you know uh the misconduct of you know encroaching on a matter uh and then making pronouncement on it which is in any case also not allowed by uh the rules of the African National Congress it seems like there's also been a great deal of dishonesty here OB Bella had told the party that his visit to Morocco was a family holiday meanwhile he engaged officials on this matter in this case the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Morocco the party then had asked him to give an explanation of this what would be an appropriate sanction against orbert Bella in this instance no this is what we have been stating all along that the African National Congress to should be seen because thec claims to be the leader of society and they should not be selective when they take decisive actions against their own and I think here the ANC demonstrate that they are capable of reigning in caders that perhaps uh you know oversteps who doesn't hold the party line but they need to be consistent so for me uh once again perhaps the party's uh disciplinary processes have to unfold uh because that for me if there are serious allegations of you know uh lack of sincerity uh then definitely that the party needs to take action already I mean uh they've made a pronouncement that you have been asked to step aside perhaps the formal processes will then uh unfold uh because thec is expected to take action on this and for me the next phase perhaps will be uh a full-blown disciplinary uh processes because we also have to be given an opportunity perhaps in a formal uh structure to provide his side of the story yeah while this is effectively a party to party matter it doesn't involve the state but there's a reasonable assumption that a policy pronouncement or lack thereof by thec can uh influence the position of the state particularly on matters of Foreign Affairs uh like we've seen in other instances is this one of those instances where the minister of international relation and cooperation Ronald lamula has to say something to make it clear that the state has a different position or has no conclusive position on the dispute in the western Sahara yeah it's going to be very difficult there's a fine line between party and state here and we' have seen it on numerous occasions where it's going to be very difficult even to try and differentiate uh between that in reality we know there's supposed to be a difference but what this actually tells us is that there is a Les lesson to be learned for all of us to say we need to know our space and there are some of our actions and decisions that have huge implications and this particular matter this pronouncement made statement made by orbert papella can has huge ramification not only for the African National Congress as you've correctly stated it may also have implications for the stuns of South Africa andtime rightly or wrongly may be drawn into this to say but this is the position of the South African government government and we we all know this is not a formal pronouncement that has been made by the South African government but uh such statements can have huge huge huge unintended consequences which is not good for South Africa which is not good for the African National Congress yeah Prof thank you so much for your time appreciate it that is Professor set who is the head of Sociology at the University of the free state e
5R7OrPjsxfE,"Prof. Thuli Madonsela, learners reflect on Social Justice in South Africa",2024-10-12T17:09:01Z,589,social justice in South Africa can only be achieved when there are equal opportunities in education and an economy for all people regardless of their race and gender these were the sentiments that were shared by pupils in in the Eastern Cape during a panel discussion which discussed the importance of social justice and accountability in the modern society 30 years since the dawn of democracy South Africa still grapples with its Legacy unequal access opportunities to education unequal pay segregated communities and massive economic differences persists South Africa has the highest gen coefficient in the world making it the most unequal Society this dialogue is created to find what social justice means to young people and if this ideal has been reached for the country social justice is uh equal rights and opportunities for everyone and I think it's so important in terms of our history as a country because previously we weren't all given equal rights and opportunities and I think to rectify the mistakes of the past is very important and so to give everyone equal rights and opportunities today means that we can all go on to have equal rights and opportunities in the workplace Justice to me um is just about fairness and accountability um as a country we come from a very difficult background and so it's all about regaining that equality amongst us just as people um and as as Humanity and um it's also about acknowledging Your Privilege if you do have it and speaking for those who don't for the Youth of today to understand their importance and the privilege it is to be able to be educated and I think once we have a buying system from everyone in the country and we all have a clear understanding of what social justice is and what we can achieve as a country with social justice um education will be so easily achieved and everyone will have a greatest advantage in our economy segregation too remains a fundamental problem in South Africa exposing large differences between public and private schools we realize that the very fact that only some can get to this amazing school is a matter of social injustice and O to the injustices of the past also what we've seen is that the neighboring schools such as St James and S Austin don't have the same resources such as Laboratories libraries and even Sports grounds so education is one area mad says more than half the population of South Africa continues to live below the national poverty line with the black population being the worst affected she says until policies are reconstructed to favor all Races economically social justice will continue to be a pipe dream Sac news the fifth International Social Justice Conference and the sixth annual social justice Summit is set to take place on the 17th and 18th of this month for a discussion on this we're joined by stellin Bosch University Center for social justice director Professor tul madella Prof madella good evening thank you so much for your time really do appreciate it social justice has itself become a contested space uh given a more polarized politics that defines the modern day approaches to solving inequality problems around the world when we think about social justice problems like hunger and the very specific divides around hunger when we think about uh differences in incarceration rates when we think about uh the differences in healthcare exess these are all social justice issues and how we solve it uh how we go about solving it has been hly contested how do we find a middle ground and a system and an approach that works greetings Ola and to their viewers and thank you for the privilege I think the starting point to solve these social justice problems that you have um outlined arly is to agree that we have a duty to advance social justice as a country it is a constitutional responsibility that is stated in the pmo and the Constitutional court has affirmed it in cases such as PR it's an international responsibility that is enshrined in uh International instruments such as um the io founding statement which was 1919 and also the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and therefore the starting point is really just to acknowledge that it's not a nice to do it's something that we all must do and I agree with you that we have to find middle CL middle ground because for social justice to be achieved in an unequal Society by Design where the state was responsible for Designing inequality then something has to be done to shift the inequalities which means some discomfort for those who are advantage and therefore that being the case then we do need a middle ground and we do need to walk gentle but walk forward yeah our Global Collective aspirations around social Justice and its achievement is captured in the United Nations sustainable development goals are we globally on track to meeting those sustainable goals no we're not on track U un Secretary General Anton GES um gave us a m 10 report that indicated that only 70% of the goals are likely to be achieved in looking at current trends and goal number two which is zero hunger is one one of those goals that are leing behind but having said that hunger is a multi-dimensional problem it's not just about food production which is agriculture it's about affordability of food which means we can't make progress as the students from Thea said on Hunger if we don't make progress on education on Health on income equality on wealth inequality and land inequality if you look at a country like South Africa and this is what agricultural Economist tells us is that we are not a food insecure country we produce enough food to feed everyone in this country yet we do have a hunger malnutrition in this country because uh food inequality and hunger and food insecurity in South Africa exist in households because of the unequal and uneven distribution of food resources um how do we solve that problem through the collective approach that you had spoken about earlier well firstly that acknowledgement mod poverty and mod than hunger is primarily an inequality issue and a Justice problem including social justice so that acknowledgement is a good starting point secondly in South Africa we have to acknowledge that 63% of house households are food insecure 177% of those are in extreme dories and how do we solve it firstly acknowledge that there's a problem look at what is already being done there's a lot of good practices and and scale that and make sure that we reach every household but based on that we've got to accept that eliminating hunger eliminating inequality is not a matter of welfare or charity it is a human rights responsibility it is a constitutional governance and a toate it's also a matter of policy are we radical in do we have the radical types of policies that are brave enough to say no one in this country should go hungry to bed when we have enough food to feed everyone well we are a country of Plenty but we also have plenty of policies and plenty of money that this country uses to try and end Hunger and I mean to be fair to government we one of the few countries that spent a lot on the social wage so it's not lack of policies or lack of political will there are three problems that are the core of it one is where these resources are being given to the people they eating by corruption the second one is where some of the people that are supposed to do the work are not competent to do it but the key one for us which we will be talking about at the Summit is what we refer to as three bullets policies that have nothing to do with food security are undermining food security they are undermining progress on equality and and and and related measures that's why we've become the most unequal Society in the world despite plenty of policies and a lot of money that has been spent to advance it yeah we're going to have to leave there thank you so much for your time I really do appreciate it that is Professor Tula Donella the director for social justice at stellin

LR3uz2LjcyY,State of SA municipalities under spotlight,2024-10-12T15:42:23Z,998,polities are at the cold phase of Service delivery a crucial platform to change the lives of ordinary South Africans but in recent years there have been concerns about not only the state of municipalities but their role and functions Additionally the vast majority of municipalities have over many years consistently failed to impress the auditor general recently the auditor General's report found that only 34 of South Africa's 257 municipalities had a clean bill of health we are going backwards in terms of the number of clean audits that are being delivered within the local government system um we are further behind than where we began with this particular Administration but in many instances the blame goes to politicians this begging the question on the RO role played by the administration the department of Cooperative governance and traditional Affairs has the responsibility of intervening when there are challenges this often entails deploying representatives from the Department to stabilize municipalities in many cases however the results have been disappointing Municipal business is a very complex business very very complex not everyone can run that business and that is why when we second people um as administrators we need to Second people with a high level of experience in running complex businesses earlier this year the M municipality came under the spotlight for a number of years this municipality has had several Municipal managers on an acting basis some contact from the Department of Cooperative governance and tradition affairs from the Northwest office under their watch during the sabc's investigation maladministration and irregularities of duplication of payments of service providers were blatant raising the question regarding accountability on the department side especially those who represent the department efforts to stabilize theot municipality are ongoing with the municipality having failed to submit its financial report to the auditor general for years a wrongdoing of some of the officials that we have seconded we are on top of those issues and uh we we we must not shy our way to say that if there is any wrongdoings by our officials we will be communicating it and drastic actions will be taken in line with the regulations that guide Cooperative governance meanwhile the director General says if there is any wrongdoing at municipalities is no one is above the law if it's proven Beyond any reasonable doubt that this particular individual was seconded there did not follow procurement processes uh did not follow contract management processes appointed a service provider without following processes then consequence management has to be implemented irrespective of who has committed it the administrators are not a of the law local government expect Dr says to realize the intended goals at municipalities a different approach must be adopted in most cases you find that someone would be you know found to have been lacking capacity in M municipality act but a few months weeks years down the line you see the very same person having been deployed to be an administrator at municipality why and you ask that but hang on shouldn't the action you know been taken you know when this person was you know you know found to be wanting at a particular their previous municipality that is why you find a person who has failed to one municipality in the past but is deployed by a national government to intervene in a municipality who will then push that municipality to a serious problem than what what it ISC news Johan is

FU8t5Lhhkxg,Mozambique elections I Venancio threatens nationwide strike if Frelimo claims victory,2024-10-12T15:13:37Z,10259,all right Dr Alexandra rosero convenor state of Africa lectures series at The Institute of panafrican narratives in Zimbabwe joins us now via video link as we monitor election results in mosm Beek thank you so much for your time this afternoon uh let's perhaps start by what we are hearing on the ground um of course High speculation that Wednesday's polls are expected to bring in and Usher in you know a younger president into power for the first time since Independence in 1975 especially as you consider the likes of the newcomer potic uh politician Daniel chopo just your observations then on what's at stake in these elections yeah um thank you for having me um and greetings from mutare Zimbabwe it's a very unfortunate that already inflammatory statements are being uh passed with regards to uh certain incumbents protagonists uh who are already saying they are not going to accept anything other than their Victory uh which is kind of misguided given the popularity that Fimo genuinely has in mozambik you know the Liberation movement always pull certain electoral surprises uh because of probably of experience and and um certain indebtedness that the people who for most of the time constitute the voters uh they have towards their party so it's exciting that if you look at Cho who is 47 years old and um on the verge of becoming president it's a departure from the old guard politics where only Veterans of The Liberation struggle in mosm would Ascend uh that position and automatically assume presidency let's look at then you know at that old God of course president uh nusi is 65 um he's of course um of the free limo party and he will be stepping down after 8 years in office how would you then characterize his leadership and also of course just given the the scandals around him including the very latest one with the tuna Bond yes uh that's the that's the Scandal that has got a dent that left a dent on fimos prospects but skillfully Chapo has managed to distance himself from the old Fimo uh saying we are new we are also going to bring in new ideas new Innovative mechanisms to bring mozambik back on track yes uh president new could be youthful uh but he belongs to to that generation of nationalists who fought in the Liberation struggle uh fronted by Fimo then the the The Liberation movement so it's different from the likes of Chapo who were born um slightly after moz's attainment of Independence so that alone is a s of relief to a Liberation movement and all over the six Liberation movement in southern Africa mosambi could actually be the first uh to have that kind of uh transition from uh the first generation of nationalists to the post war candidates in the party assuming power if you look at Dynamics Inc they are still vexed by The Liberation Dynamics ZF in Zimbabwe swapo in Namibia uh pla in Angola as well as Chama Chama pindu in Tanzania so I I I'm very sure Chapo stands a chance to win just on based on that marked departure alone because that's what people for most of the time look at they also want generational renewal which uh is fused with the st2l Nationalist politics I'm Keen also you know to to know and to understand from you uh how the other candidates have addressed issues that are top of mind to mosm beans you mentioned of course Chapo a lot uh but there's there's other three others you know that we've seen including the independent candidate just given the fact that there's so many things going on in that country including of course the ongoing armed conflict uh you know being waged uh by isil in in Cabo delgardo Province and of course the job creation and also the economic issues too just who do you think came out of very strongly there just touching on what mosm beans really want to hear thank you uh so if you look at u m as well as vencio montand uh unfortunately for vencio he is coming as a breakaway from renamo the key opposition but if you look at renamo now renamo of today is kind of weak because of the demobilization disintegration that took place and diffusion of a bigger Chun of Ren into Fimo so the message of the current uh opposition Leaders with regards to addressing unemployment with regards to addressing issues of inequality uh climate change as well as the current ongoing conflict in the North in form of a cob delado the their messages are are resonating on the same them uh but I think it's coule who surprised them by saying no we will engage in in dialogue in talks others are saying no that we can we have to deploy forcefully we are not doing in enough in as much as deployment is concerned and if you look at mon Grand's message he saying no we might blame the issue of Cabo Del to terrorism Etc but it is it also denotes with the miseries that the youths are facing on a daily basis hence becoming vulnerable to be easily conscripted into terrorist uh organizations such as the ones that are operating in mamb so the messages by the four protagonists uh they are kind of interestingly the same but the methodology the approach on how they are going to deal with them it's the one that differ so the they kind of resonate the four candidates in terms of what are the challenges prevailing challenges currently affecting mosic but the methodological approaches with regards to the how part on how they are going to resolve them it's the one that differ so you have the incumbent who will benefit from incumbent uh by way of um inheriting what n did and say look we have uh done ABCD then you have the two protagonists who more or less have the same message but one is a splinter and also now commanding a coalition of about nine political parties who entered as a Coalition in this election but more or less are all disr EST Ren establishments then you have the independent latero simango I would say they are the same it's the methodological techniques in dealing them which differ with obviously the incumbents benefiting much from that kind of framing because at least they've managed to diffuse the conf Dr rera I would imagine that that will all then culminate in what we are expected to see uh starting to trickle in today and maybe even in a few days time and just on that I mean we are expecting preliminary results uh which are expected of course to be declared today unfolding as we expect the official results just over you know two weeks after the poll how do you then see all of this panning out um especially when you uh when we are in fact reporting today that mosm be's Independent presidential candidate uh monan in fact saying that allegedly saying that he will call for a nationwide strike if the ruling party Freo claims victory in the presidential election how do you then see uh those uh preliminary results coming out and how should they be treated I think uh it's uh an early warning sign uh already you we have a candidate with preempting uh results uh which is kind of politically unwise at this stage uh because if you consented to participate in an election at least you should allow all the due processes so I would say his utterances already a confirmation of who is going to win uh which win they are already saying it's disputed it's contested but it is important at this stage to wait for all the initial processes including also the sadic Observer election Mission uh in mosik uh report as well as the African Union and other likeminded organization who were observing these elections the good thing is they have voted in peace uh they haven't been minimum levels of violence related to elections and if a mozambik boils the wall of the region uh will actually catch the heat so we just wish the mamans to conclude their pleite in peace Dr rero thank you so much for your analysis really do appreciate it uh thank you so much for com coming on to the

JvTRCFj7PVA,Middle East | Israeli offensive continues in region,2024-10-12T14:27:18Z,2933,"rescue and clearing Rubble operations got underway after Israel attacked the libanese capital bayout authorities have reported that 22 people have been killed and 117 wounded among the dead is a family of eight including three children here in South Africa they are growing calls for a permanent sisire in the Middle East the troubling moment of the world continues um I believe that the geopolitical context is at an extremely Waring uh uh level of conflict of division and the absence of leadership this is the most frightening of all that there's no one that we're seeing who's the adult in the room and who's standing up and saying let's put a pause and a stop uh to this so I wish the world could become more mature more cognizant of the rights of others and more concerned about ending uh war and conflict the devastation on the people of Palestine and Lebanon uh is horrifying while the eff says Israel must be held accountable journalists and Aid workers have also been ruthless ruthlessly targeted while Israeli leaders openly declare their intention to obliterate Palestinian life the complicity of the International Community particularly Western powers like the US and the UK has been disgraceful despite the international court of justice issuing an advisory opinion to not be complacent in genocidal acts billions in military aid have been channeled to Israel perpetuating its War Machine in what amounts to a proxy war the eff will continue to put pressure on South African government to cut all diplomatic ties with Israel Israel says it won't be deterred from its mission on October 8th another Iranian terrorist proxy balah attacked Israel completely unprovoked they fired missiles and Rockets into our cities they made 60,000 Israelis leave their homes along the Lebanon border becoming refugees in their own land and the subsequent months they haven't stopped for a single day attacking us no country can accept The Wanted rocketing of its cities we can't accept it either we will take whatever action is necessary to restore security and to bring our people safe back to their homes meanwhile the US says the future of Lebanon is up to its citizens and a diplomatic solution is needed one of the main challenges that we've seen in Lebanon uh is the fact that Hezbollah effectively has taken over many state functions and in particular in holding on to its uh its arms which is not supposed to be the case remember Israel was in southern Lebanon for a long time 18 years and it got out in 2000 and part of getting Israel out of Lebanon were important understandings that are in un Security Council resolution 1701 1559 that among other things would make sure that forces are not up at the at the border between the country certainly not irregular forces like Hezbollah and non-state actors were supposed to be disarmed well that didn't happen and Hezbollah has posed an ongoing threat to Israel ever since kyli kumalo scbc news Johannesburg"
oo8aP3Qw-Us,"International Day of the Girl Child | Rights, challenges faced by young girls",2024-10-12T14:20:40Z,334,to this now yesterday the world marked International Day of the girl child the day is observed annually on October 11th with an aim to recognize girls rights and the unique challenges girls face around the world now adolescent girls have the right to a safe educated and healthy life not only during these critical formative years but also as they mature into women however teenage girls in South Africa face numerous challenges including lack of Parental support or mentorship negative influences and limited access to resources save the children South Africa has joined the global movement to amplify girls voices and create positive opportunities for them to succeed under the theme girls vision for the future now to take this discussion further we're now joined via video link bybi mzi author of the Gen Z pocketbook for teenage girls roomi thank you so much for your time and good afternoon to you firstly I want to talk about your partnership with save the children South Africa and how your gen Z pocketbook for teenage girls will align with just some of the work that they are currently doing for children in essence in this country thank you for having me so I'm excited to talk about this partnership the children does is around holistic children to making sure that they have a bright future do a lot of different programs ac across Child Protection health and nutrition is under the education pillar that comes that we equip not only speak to technical skills the soft skills that are needed today so that as benefit from um of hard skills that are taught in schools Al combine that with the soft skills thinking lead are picking the right careers that can make good on all the opportunities and I I mean it it must have been quite a task for you to address some of these challenges and Reflections through storytelling so just talk to us about you know how you you were able to navigate this terrain I mean we talking essentially here about issues uh for young girls at a time when we have high teenage pregnanc es high unemployment rate gbv femicide at a time where bullying is now causing and resulting in our children taking their own lives but also at a time when they're just trying to be teenagers and navigate that Dynamic honest it's hard to package it all into one book book because I look at what are the concise no lessons for a teenager channeled my my inner 18-year-old to think about up in these times I have wanted to know to cope with the challenges that you've just outlined but also some of the things that helped me when I was that age to come out of uh various challenges think a bit of self Grace mistakes that were made and from a storytelling perspective I think important to make sure that we are relatable in what we because the challenges are real that girls know that are valid struggles that they have gone through many of us have experienced and we back and help them aiming to achieve with a book The Emotions that young girls go through and to tell them that there are mentors like me who need to help them with whatever they're going through think that it's a process to be able to share mental models wide reaching but then that we have uh real conversations in the real world to make sure that we can support one another so the book there you can put down on paper it is of a conversation that I'm hoping that with save the children we're able to not only have the book in circulation Al book in circulation and then of um in-person conversations that allow students to engage with the material and then through conversation connect that to their specific issues so that they understand how the principles world I mean um you you talk about um imparting skills such as critical thinking and and Leadership I mean that is quite an important characteristic to have especially for young girls that are navigating this terrain but I'm more interested in how then you are able to merge that um upskilling to also balance it with the fact that some of these goals really come from backgrounds where there is no support uh especially parental support and where parents don't understand this generation and will uh no doubt find that you know the girls are of course not um obeying or being respectful when they do stand up for themselves how do you then balance you know the fact that they now need to upskill themselves but also have to deal with parents who just simply don't understand teenagers great thank you for that question for it because it goes it takes me back to the very first section of the book I am encouraging Young Learners to take it upon themselves to understand who they are your parents raise you but you decide who you are your point there isn't support how do you at a young age start to take control the mental needs that you have of your environment you would have support in the home would have support at schools times there's both a gap at home and at schools Learners to look at what is what else is available in their environment are there friends are there uh social groups Church groups that can the support that is liking at home because ultimately they are building their lives even now in high school I Focus specifically on teenagers because you gave of challenges that they face not careful to take ownership of their lives years very serious mistakes them for the rest of their lives for a long portion of their lives it's understand that quences to their actions that important to mold their mind mindsets for them to understand that they do have some level of control times in our African culture parents than life important that children find a zone of control for themselves where they say in as much as I'm still under my parental roof things that I can do for myself to improve and this of those lessons that children can take forward to themselves see one immediately available to them in the home uh and I mean as we wrap our conversation rby I do realize of course um that there are probably a lot of things that would need to come into play here for for this to reach a wider audience but in in the world of this digital divide that we find ourselves in there's so many you know schools to to Target and to reach how do you then plan to take this forward and and make sure that you reach those communities that probably would benefit more um you know from this book and also just from uh save the children South Africa in terms of uh their joining the global movement uh for for girl children in terms of of its Vision well a simple part of that is to make the book available in print digital divide and like to make resources available online uh for many Learners they simply need a and that's that's why we're making this pledge to corporates to make sure that the resources in pocket book book in print has an extensive network of schools and Community organizations around the country um through the help of sponsorship we'll be able to make sure that copies do reach these schools are able to facilitate by teachers and as well Community leaders that say the children children has um established parts of this country so of teachers uh capacitating the youth workers who are embedded in these communities to lead with learners but Guided by a resource which is practical and immediately impactful to the challenges that young people face RBI thank you so much for your time really do appreciate you coming on to the show all right roomi

MymzDUjV_i0,Heatwave alert issued in parts of SA : Meteorologist Mduduzi Mthembu weighs in,2024-10-12T13:50:52Z,8833,well we have roped in in studio our very own meteorologist here at the sac Dudu just to unpack the heat way phenomenon that most parts of the country are experiencing this weekend andd a very good afternoon to you and thank you so much for your time so essentially we understand now that there are warnings for specifically the uh Kulu Nal as well as hting provinces but where else can we expect you know this heat wave and importantly just how high are we talking about here okay uh the heat wave is actually over the Central and Eastern provinces of the country meaning the the three state Northwest and the interior of the Eastern C Province inal and we expecting these conditions to persist up until tomorrow on Sunday and then the other provinces these conditions will even persist into into Monday M so I mean already this so many disaster management teams that are on standby we've heard from the Johannesburg Emergency Services advising people to take precaution but what do we do you know in a time like this what do people do you know just to stay safe especially if you consider that some areas don't actually have water you know to to keep hydrated yeah in fact water is the main thing that people need to do drink lots and lots of water even though there is shortages of water but it is important to remain hyd ated also seek shade and also avoid strainless activities like sports and other activities that you may be doing outside so seek shelter avoid strainers activities and drink lots and lots of water and also avoid being indirect sunlight because that also contributes to high temperatures so I mean of course uh you're saying that some of this heat wave is likely to last until Sunday but what can we attribute this to because I mean often times we talk about these Trends being very much linked to climate change is there something else here in as far as Trends are concerned that we can you know consider well you cannot pinpoint one event to climate change directly but we have noticed in the past couple of years that the temperature has been warming and also this also results in the temperatures being this hot but as you can as you also know that we are at this time of the year which is the warmer season in the country therefore we can expect heat wave conditions and in fact in the season forecast we're expecting above normal temperatures in many areas of the country meaning that we will see days of very hot conditions like we are currently seeing and these conditions are expected to persist in some provinces up until Monday so directly you cannot say this is climate change but the trend is towards the warming we have seen warming happening globally it's not just here in South Africa the temperature of the earth is rising and therefore we can expect lots and lots of Heatwave conditions in many parts of the world and and I mean what are we know that this obviously is a forecast and often times we see that some provinces may not necessarily be experiencing extreme weather conditions but some may but what provinces are you particularly worried about in terms of the heat wave the Northwest is one of the provinces that can see temperatures reaching above 40° in Pang as well the low field of Pang and lmop kuuza temperatures can go up to 42° at times but then even in other provinces where the temperatures are not supposed to be that hot but like the free state and the Eastern Cape temperatures in areas there reaching 38° in and and by there for today but in W natal it's only the western parts where we expecting the temperatures to be very hot along the coastal provinces of the country temperatures don't really go high because of the ocean but over the central interior at this time of the year which is the beginning of the warmer season we can expect temperatures to be very very hot in many areas I mean you mentioned the Northwest Province um a province that probably has seen a lot of farmers experiencing drought conditions and a lot of fires as well as well as the you know the the the Free State any signs that that could also be a possibility in terms of the Northwest Province and other Inland provinces in terms of felt fires You' remember that we haven't really reached the Rainy part of the year so the ground is very dry meaning there is vegetation that can catch fire then on top of that it is also very hot meaning that it contributes to the possibility of development of f fires and then in those areas where it has been drought it means that there is lots and lots of vegetation which is dry and it can actually easily result in runaway fires in those parts of the country well we certainly don't hope that that happens and do thank you so much for your time really do appreciate it all right of course that was our very own dzi Tempo there just again just giving context around this heat wave that is expected to hit the country uh until at least Sunday going into next week in fact it has already begun I can tell you right here in hting

we seeing uh the police uh Paul bearers there part of the ceremonial part of of that service right so this is week in review on the sabc news channel on this Saturday afternoon we will see you right after this break welcome back the minister of police senum kununu recently revealed that a staggering 50 detectives leave the South African Police Service every month this alarming rate of departure has contributed to a significant shortage of skilled detectives now saps has last approximately 8,400 detectives since 2016 reducing the number of detectives from 26,000 to 17,600 now this crisis is compounded by the fact that the remaining detectives face overwhelming workloads with hundreds of dockets assigned to each detective making it challenging for victims to receive Justice the high attrition rates and shortage of detectives have severe implications for Community safety and crime prevention now to address this the government has introduced a reenlistment strategy to bring back experienced detectives to effectively combat crime it's essential to address these challenges and find Sustainable Solutions to retain experienced detectives and improve Community safety South Africa's crime crisis continues to play communities victims cry out for justice but cases go cold due to a shortage of detectives we spoke to Daniel a victim of crime who shared his traumatic experience so I got robbed I got how can I say like I got robbed I got stabbed and and nothing is happening I got to I've been to court cases and still nothing is happening nothing has been sent to me like a message or something and still waiting for those people that is apparently on trial and still waiting for something to happen I don't know what's happening they just said that the people is got they caught them and I don't know I don't know so I just went on with my life Daniel's story is not isolated Mama Gloria from Brixton fear victimization and shares her relatives frustrating experiences with uninvestigated cases 2022 was evicted in mayair we did go open a case in John Foster he just vanished they just tell her theop on leave when he come back we help until today we never get helped even our own own counselor counselor he don't assist us when there's things like that they were not happy at all brickton Community Forum chairperson Sophia Wells Echoes the concerns of her community I think that if we get all detectives back it would be a wonderful thing I think we need the extra resources I think one of the deterrence of crime you know we always say oh bring back the death penalty you know but the problem is if you don't catch the guy in the first place or the woman uh then then you you have a problem anyway so the threat of being caught is actually what stops and prevents somebody from doing the crime so I think having detectives is key and professionalizing the police I mean having pride in what they do being able to do their job I think this is one of the things you know you you're tasked with keeping a community safe but it's actually become very difficult and you have limited resources so having more skilled detectives back doing their job wonderful at least 50 detectives leave the South African Police Service each month this is according to police Minister senom tunu the officers leave for various reasons including being lured by higher packages in the private sector but this seems to have left the criminal justice system paralyzed and communities exposed as crime saws unabated in some parts of the country however this could change as saps have decided to entice detectives back into the beat Yong zik a respected leader in Alexandra Township and the udm City of Johannesburg councelor weighs in on the reenlistment initiative what's important I think in this day and age in 2024 um we cannot be just um you know human resourcing the the polic system only but we should be applying U you know technology into our you know in our ways of fighting crime so we cannot just rely on just the detectives that were there and the ones who are here and um rely on on on on our Poli system having to recruit more people into coming into the force but we need technology also to be able to Benchmark um um um the skills and reskilling of others all of that but also the other question is is that these detectives were away for quite some time in the Police Service they do not know how to use the current technology that is already there we accept that they're going to be trained for 3 months the question is we know how government is 3 months is it enough to to train people who are not in the in the PO service and who are going to be introduced into the I sector right now but we're saying that we are in this day and age of artificial intelligence and uh fourth industrial re ution why don't you deploy droves um things that are not going to need human resource on the ground or boots on the ground back in the heart of Brixton where crime rates saw da Ward councelor Kyle offers a glimmer of hope with the reenlistment initiative so crime is very right in brickton and surrounding areas like Oakland Park malville which is also in my ward I saw the numbers that they in listing it's just over 200 people so that isn't a significant amount of people so I think they need to strategically deploy these people and I believe they are going to mostly be deployed as detectives so they need to bring those skills and bring those skills and impart them within the South African Police Service um because it won't be significant boots on the ground but it will be knowledge that is coming in so that knowledge can be used to assist with solving crimes dealing with syndicates mafias and any sort of organized crime that operate with in these areas the reenlistment of experienced ex cops may be a step towards justice but it is only the beginning right now this afternoon on weekend review We examin the reenlistment initiative its potential impact and the concerns surrounding it joining us today is Professor whitness kuani Malu he's a criminologist and a policing expert good afternoon and thank you so much for being with us today a very good day for the listeners uh thanks for having me Professor Malu what's your initial assessment of this reenlistment initiative um overall I would say that um the reinvestment of the police in relation to the detective section uh is just a a right step you know towards a reduction of the crime but uh it's going to solve the crime problem slightly it's not something that is going to be sort of uh Silver Bullet kind uh initiative is something that we need to work in progress in say we need to respect the process and then we allow it yearly uh to be for them to be recruitment back to the service but the biggest question is why did they left the service in the first place we really need to go back and understand what were the reasons for them to live the service and after that that's where we'll be able to improve ourself as the South African Police Service uh as an organization because for me to recruit them back to the service what if some of them uh were left the service because they were under misconduct irregularities well some of them might be uh not longer interested in the service you know losing the patient so I think we need to go back to understand the ration strategy uh the recruitment of such detective uh in a good manner and then that's where maybe we can go we can say that crime can be reduced in to the acceptable level but for now this is just a a small small small uh uh salt into the uh big problem yes how can reenlisting the experienced X cops address specifically the detective shortage and all those dockets that they have to deal with I there is no way that the recruitment of over maybe 200 detective can uh uh respond to the docket uh that are available or crime level in South Africa it's just something that shows that they are doing something in relation to ticking boxes I don't think with honesty that uh the ratio between the police and the citizens of South Africa Vis the cries that happen can ever be addressed by recruiting 2,000 of the we need to eners our investigation skills we really need to to to ensure that uh we we we better ourselves as a service uh but the this recruitment strategy is not going to decrease uh the docket uh allocation would you say that there are potential risks or challenges associated with reenlisting previous uh police members yes the the ah there are challenges uh we we really the Police Service itself it it is not immune to corruption it is not even immune to to criminal you know we have police officials who are criminals themselves we have resigned you know sitting at home some under suspension we might find ourselves recruiting back the criminals back to the service so we need to to to be efficient in our recruitment process and make sure that we don't just say we are recruiting back the sergeant the cable the officers back to the service we really need to do Thor Thor check in order to ensure that we don't recruit the criminals back into the service for them to be loed with the others that are are ethical in nature okay so you alluded to this earlier um in terms of what long-term policing strategies should we prioritize in this country to combat crime effectively then all right um we we need m agency approach whereby we will be able to involve other stakeholders we have other stakeholders that are private in nature uh who can help the police to add boots on the ground like your private Securities under the guidance ship of s they can help the criminal intelligence need to be uh enhanced in order for the police to to perform uh well in their functions the communities as well they need to provide detailed information to the police because we have our criminals in our communities another thing that we need to understand is uh the IP as well need to come into play and uh the oversight bodies need to ensure that they they look into the injustices that the communities face on the hands of the police uh the likes of the Secretariat for police you know they need to come in you know to to to ensure that the police when they do wrong they face the mighty law of Justice another thing that we need to do is to ensure that there is uh employee employees Wellness in the police the police must be taken care of they need to be protected whistleblowers need to be uh protected as well that's where we can say then we are the police are not the only uh service that are responsible for the pl for the crime prevention combating an investigation or menance of other there will be other stakeholders that comes in you know like uh your Social Development as well your social workers your psychologist other department you know as well as other entities entities that uh can help the police the police themselves alone cannot prevent crime do sometimes you find uh the s andf coming into help them in some instances because they are dealing with organized crimes they are dealing with assets cits kidnappings you know your violence crime that doesn't need one person or one organization it need multiple organization and integrated approaches to to to win the war against Crime what about Community oriented policing can that enhance safety and Trust yeah Community oriented policing problem Orient policing uh intelligence lead policing they they are there in writing but when we come to the ground level in terms of the implementation that is not happening we have community in blue they are trying to isure the preses of uh police boots on the ground but the the the problem now is are they trained enough to deal with criminals you know because even though the person committed crime at the end of the day that person is still a human being it need to be protected in terms of the constitutional right so end up again facing civil suit because we don't even know how to approach uh the the criminals and we we find ourselves being uh going to court in a civil manner whereby we need to defend ourself again for not handling criminals in a good way so community ored policing it's a good strategy is being there you know um in relation to National crime prevention strategy but overall it's not something that we can say it's going to work without involving the traditional way of combating crime Vis the cotemporal way of combating crime in line with the new technologies that we we see ourself in you know and as well as the issue of involving other stakeholders that uh they can train us privately so in order for the police to be able to respond to the advised technologies that are being used by Cals to to be able to respond to Crime as well holistically I want to ask you about that because um it's talk about modern crime because um things have changed since some of these members were in The Police Service a while back so how can technology enhance the investigative capabilities and then In the End Community safety technology is good tool to to to to respond to Crime but it comes again with challenges in terms of ethical issues we really need to understand that one cannot just use a drone to just in infringe another person's privacy so we we need to apply it with with knowledge we need to be trained how can we use it effectively you know uh body cameras to be used by traffic cops it's it's something that can be used investigative tools that can be used to to to to determine maybe DNA uh analysis in terms of the backlog you you radio frequency identification they can be used nicely but we we we we can use them while we are knowledgeable about the application and believe you me those individuals that were in the service in the past my my father was a police uh if you bring him back to the police now what kind of UE is going to bring because he might not even know how to touch a computer you know how to to to operate the Drone those are specialized field they need people who should be trained to be able to operate such uh Technologies so we're not going to sit here and say technology can be available tool it cannot be if it can be however it needs training not every police officers official can operate a drone not every police official can can can can can operate a machine that analyzed uh DNA evidence we need training these are specialized field and the government must pop money into those specialized Fields let me ask you this how does South Africa's reenlistment initiative now compared to to International based practice what happens around the world we are we are very we are left behind we are left behind if we are in the fourth Industrial Revolution in South Africa we are still maybe in the in the second quarter of that if not thatd we are still leing behind uh in the in the overseas internationally they prioritize policing for one to be a police officer is a it goes with paion it goes with something of value they value them but come to South Africa if you look into even the the packages that they get I was I was reading about the packages that they will get the the detectives uh C stes the the officers the sergeant I mean there's no motivation that one cannot just go back to the service to earn peanuts whereas now is in the private sector earning big money and another thing and of is when the crime happen they analyze it there's quick response there is quick analysis of evidence but in South Africa you spend years waiting for DNA to come back and we have a backlog of DNA a backlog of of DNA evidence in terms of analis so South Africa in short we still developing in nature those are developed countries you are China your USA Professor thank you so much our time is unfortunately but thank you so much for joining us with your Insight this afternoon Professor whitness kuani Malu criminologist and policing expert this is weekend review and we'll be back right after this welcome back you're watching weekend review here on the sabc news channel now the communities in luiki siki in the Eastern Cape of

about him they spoke highly of him and they are saying they are going to miss him so dearly let me introduce one of the familiar faces in the entertainment industry that would be Opera thank you very much for your time let's start up to talk about so moo your friend he was a friend indeed and a friend inde yeah so was a friend in in need and a friend indeed yeah um I know so from tamy Memorial you know a person who was passionate about changing people's lives you see but unfortunately so was so disappointed even when he died you wanted to talk about the ill treatment of artists in the industry including M when we talking of America America is so big because of the artist the singers the dancers you know and America is taking care care of the artist but here in South Africa W it's so very bad now you see people on screen television if they've got money go to them they've got nothing the government will promise you 1 2 3 4 5 and when you die that's where they come and advertise themselves that now we are in the government and yet when you are sick you are in the hospital nobody care so was on Tik Tok all over so is sick he need assistance we've got so very big companies which are investing in our government but the government is doing nothing and when you start speaking and now it is up to us as artists to make it a point that we take a responsibility about our lives and ourselves but a black man you are on your own you I just want us to talk about the about the ill treatment of solu I just want to talk about him in bana being a lifted to South Africa sick and eventually passing away so before he went to I had a problem okay and which was supposed to be fixed by the government what problem well he had when he he told me he told me that he was a a diabetic and I was suffering from hypen and as well as the high blood pressure okay yeah but now as time goes by so told me that hey I'm not feeling well but I'll make it a point that I'm going I must perform be careful when you perform died on the stage no I'll be soldier who died with his boots on and unfortunately when he went to to go perform trying to raise money so that he should go to the hospital and get a better treatment he collapsed and was from there was taken to the hospital now instead of government knew so was so sick instead of saying okay let's take so even by helicopter fly him to the best H hospital it was not like that did you manage to talk to him though when he was in South Africa back from bana I met s before he went to I should think maybe a month ago was okay yeah before he got sick I should think apparently in September uh where he was in in in hospital I couldn't even communicate with him and I was busy shooting movies with the young children all kind of things but truly speaking the government has done us down you can tell me now what what do artists need to do the young ones now in terms of maintaining their health in terms of making sure that they don't go around in the Limelight messing around not wasting their money so that they can be better people when they grow up and in times of in terms of need they have something so so's death we close so's eyes and so open our eyes and we need to pass the message to the young artist that U please as an artist look after yourself okay make it a point that when you an artist you've got a name that name of

police Minister senen kununu hopes to strengthen coordination between the South African Police Service and private security firms in order to prevent South Africa from devolving into a criminal State kunu met with the private security industry regulatory Authority as a first step in collaborating with some of the larger corporations in the industry and this is part of a larger plan that could result in more coordination and C operation between the saps and the private security sector kunu has stated unequivocally that the crime rate in South Africa is rising and is actually intolerable uh with murder and kidnapping for ransom among the most common forms of law breaking joining us this afternoon is Mike Bas who is a registered private investigator to speak to us about this Mike good afternoon and thank you so much for being here with us on week in review today thank you thank you for the opportunity tell us about the the significance of this collaboration and whether you think this will be fruitful it's absolutely significant and uh it should have been implemented years and years ago I I'm concerned that it's maybe too late the difference between the public the government and the authority in itself is enormous there is no proper relationship we've been the last year gone out of our way just to get the public work working together with the authorities with the governments and we've seen a change and it is better but now to get the authorities uh working with private security which for years has been very badly tainted it's going to be very difficult first first of all there are many much more security companies that are corrupt than good I would say I haven't done a proper thorough evaluation investigation but I would say from our latest at least 80% of them won't be able to really assist because there's so much corruption and they won't make a difference they will actually become a problem okay so as someone who works uh in in the private security industry do you believe the government has the funds to make this work to to carry out this whole process and and what are the most important steps that must be done now well uh the funds is going to be a problem but I also have a problem with Safety and Security private uh industries that wouldn't uh themselves put their hands in their pocket because uh that's their country they are in that uh for the money but they should absolutely the top priority should be to save themselves from all the crime in this country but all the people that they serve as well so they should uh involve their monies and their expertise and their infrastructure and help the government and the authorities look if we get a I'm 100% for it and I will assist on the highest level in government and with the police and we work with the top police infrastructure and it has shown that when we work with them and the public together it makes a huge difference we've seen it in kidnappings uh the kidnappings has dropped it's because ourselves and other Safety and Security Industries as well as the public and the authorities worked hand inand you know just curbing stuff like fake news making sure that everybody whether he plays the smallest part or is the general just see I to ey have one common goal and that's to identify this crime evaluate the crime do the risk analysis investigate the crime solve the crime and prevent the crime then it can work okay you said that private security should also put money in do they have the money how lucrative is this private security industry well let me tell you shockingly and they must listen they pocket and they coin just just one simple statement there are so many security companies that have got security guards out there that get a tenth of what they charge the clients if they for instance charge a business and a big business they will charge an enormous monthly amount and the security guards get just the required and requested uh fee that s requires the uh security officers board in South Africa so they just do what they need to do and then they don't take responsibilities when there's crimes in the area so there there has to be a real serious step up because we know exactly what's going on and that's why I'm concerned what are some of the main areas or crimes that you think would need attention now well first of all we need to deal with a serious violent crimes in South Africa the kidnappings the crimes against children women and the elderly um cashing transits has dropped uh tremendously I'm I'm very happy with that but any case where there's a serious violent crime should take first priority rapes child molestation sexual violent crimes um domestic violent crimes etc etc and then the economic crimes as well because all these crimes are hand inand uh working together uh the the syndicates or the criminals so in other words a guy who commits a violent crime is also committing in a serious economic crime he's also committing a cyber crime because they use cell phones and technology to plan all these kidnappings and serious violent crimes so the technology side of the authorities digital and electronic communication should be really stepped up and and checked uh with the financials that these criminals have because if you take the financials away the criminal can't cope if you take the freedom of communication and just getting information illegally as they like way they cannot plan so all these facets of the criminals needs to be addressed um very harshly do you believe this step is is an admission by government uh basically of failing to secure the country of the National Security I would rather say it is a realization into an admission but uh I have respect for that M I have the utmost respect for the and uh I'm positive about the new government we have because they have realized things and they've changed things and they're trying to deal with corruption make no mistake there are good policemen out there there are good politicians out there there are good people out there there are 90% of good people out there it's the 10% that hijacks this country the problem of corruption is it's a small handful that influences a lot of people to do nothing to stand aside to look away not get involved and they they're part of the problem so they hijack our country with fear and intimidation as a small group and and they are the ones that's the head that needs to be dealt with but the government is basically admitting guys like we have been saying all along we have to work together all put all our resources together put our minds together see eye to ey at least on this subject and that is to identify the crime solve the crime and eradicate the crime so the minister said that he spent his first week in office talking to several police leaders talking to ipit the investigative directorate also to the private security regulatory Authority do you know what these meetings were about well basically what we've discussed here uh the possibilities uh can we trust the private security industry SRA will have to and there's a lot of corruption in s as well and S knows this and they have a huge problem dealing with it but they also trying their best and the same with the heads of the of the police the police knows there's a lot of corruption in the um in in those that work for the police they know that and remember corruption as I've said is not only the policeman that physically commits the crime but the one that doesn't protect and serve and do his work or is not equipped or not trained uh or not uh being part of the solution uh that's that's the main problem so the the meetings was definitely about how shall we go about this how do we get all these private security firms first of all evaluated and if they if it's worth it the effort and as you've said what it would cost and how do we go about it and how do we what do we put in place that there's no corruption or abuse because the other concern I have is that uh what private security companies many of times do they would abuse the government fees and uh the main thing that I suggest the government does is that they know exactly inside and out how does all levels of Safety and Security companies in South Africa work because we different we are specialist investigators serious violence serious economic serious cyber but 95% 98% of all security companies are more in guarding they're more on visual policing they're more on an information structure informance structure um making a difference because they are there they can quickly act as as a task team and I that's what they've discussed how do we bring them all in each one playing their part and role without uh misusing the situation or abusing the situation Mike just lastly uh quickly you mentioned this earlier modern crimes technology cyber crime and so on where does the capability sit to to actually fight this it's it's I don't want to use the word non-existent because we've once again seen that the authorities with ourselves and others join together and those that do have the proper equipment to track and Trace uh to uh get all digital and electronic information background information and look if you have information before a crime's committed then you can prevent the crime if you only act afterwards it's after the fact then you still have all that information necessary in order to save the people further if it's a kidnapping for instance or get the loot or money back or to get or catch the criminals so that's where we have with other situations in our country and our authori is a huge problem it's very very difficult to get the technology in and the country has tried it many of times but um it it didn't work and there was corruption there involved as well but that is something that needs to be concentrated on because information is power okay thank you so much for joining us here this afternoon thank you for for your insights Mike BOS who is a registered private investigator and he was talking to us there about the possible collaboration between the South African Police Service and the private security industry we continue with this story now m is gathered at the Nady Hall in Soto for the memorial service of the five children who died of suspected food poisoning last weekend they had allegedly consumed snacks bought from a foreign-owned spaza shop the incident has led to the closure of a number of spaza shops in the area by the disgruntled residents the N Community Hall was F to capacity Learners community members local government officials and the cing education department were in attendance at the mass memorial for the five deceased Learners the mood was somber as teachers described the impact their deaths Have Heard on Friday when he left it hurts so much to realiz that he's no more however I'm grateful for the time I had to spend with him njabulo was not just a child he was energetic together with his friend who is in hospital they used to compete well in class the residents are still fuming they demand answers and a proper inspection of the spart shops government needs to do that they make laws after making laws they must Implement uh those those laws whether it's policies or bylaws that's one way of doing it and then the other way of doing it government can also come up with campaigns whereby communities are taught about the dangers of any other situation that may affect them adversely educationc M chani says this incident will be dealt with as a priority there's P shop that is said to have provided this um food that poisoned our children led to our children's death H was found to have a certification that it can can provide this service so really really it means those who are accountable you know need to start doing their work and really being ensuring that it's done so there that's why there was a call on the local government local authorities in particular for health because they the ones who give this certification that a person can trade for food you know to really start doing more work and more accountability and really getting things right the five children who were between the ages of 6 to 10 will be given a mass send off at the M Community Hall on Sunday AC news inur welcome back Nel judge pit Kun says the only way to deal with Stalingrad tactics is to reduce the number of appeals available to a disgruntled accused Kun was interviewed on Monday by the Judicial Service Commission for one of three vacancies on the Supreme Court of Appeal now for more on this we are joined this afternoon by the Constitutional law expert Advocate Lono nand good afternoon and thank you so much for being with us here today uh good afternoon okay let's ask you what are your views on how the limiting uh of appeals basically could impact accountability for corruption particularly among these these high ranking officials yes the the proposal by judge K is a is a progressive proposal the unfortunate part of it is that in terms of the our constitution is that every accused person has a right to a fair trial which includes the right to appeal a judgment if the accused person is not satisfied with that judgment but the strategy of standrad tactics it it it is a problem because it allow accused person to escape accountability in terms of the actions which they have taken while the they are still in a in a public service or in government so because they keep on appealing decisions Justice and you know that Justice delayed is Justice denied okay so in your view how urgent would you say it is to to look at this to to to reform the the appeal processes it is it is more urgent under democracy our democracy is still 30 years of age and uh it has been proven that there are some of the things which were supposed to have legislated or put them in the Constitution was currently the current law allow an accused person to appeal and there's no number of appeals which an accused person can do as long as the accused person has the money the accused person Services of the lawyers the accused person can appeal so but I believe that at some stage H we have to have a law which limit the number of appeals so that you don't have accused persons who use the the strategy in Mala or or in bad faith they they use it so the the the bottom line is that there must be a law which limit the number of appeals which can be a explode by an accused person okay so there's been some disagreement about who is responsible who must act to curb these stengr tactics especially that have delayed the justice for key figures behind the state capture of course and the arms deal it's dragged on for for many years now who must act is it the law commission is it the courts Parliament the law societies the Chief Justice who's responsible all all all the parties all the arms of government must act because the the the parliament must reform the current law to address the the number of appeals an accused person can can can do so I believe that there is a need for for a law to be crafted to address that but also on the Judiciary the Judiciary has the responsibility also to guard against accused persons who abuse the the the the power or who abused their status in a society in in a case wherein when an accused person has has money he he he explore every option any decision which is taken by by the court so I I believe that the Judiciary must watch out and guard against those accused persons who abuse the the the process or who abuse the Constitution we know that the has granted the accused persons the right in terms of section 35 of the Constitution to say that every accused person has a right to a fair trial and have a right to have access to to a court so so so in other words there's no limit in terms of the Constitution but that right when is being enforced the Judiciary must interpret the law carefully so that they guard against those who abuse the the process or who abuse the remedies which are available to them in case they are not satisfied with decisions of the Court okay so you mentioned this earlier that you would like to see a law crafted uh who would you like to see involved in the crafting of that law and how do long do you think that will take them it might take time but remember we we we are fortunate now we are in the seventh Administration Parliament is starting its a fiveyear term and they can pass the the bill but it must also start with the law law Reform Commission which must do research because remember the the rights which we have in the Bill of Rights these are hard fought rights and you don't want these rights to disadvantage accused persons because you want accused persons to be afforded their contion rights but at the same time you want to also balance it to those few who might want to abuse the process so you have the opportunity for the law Reform Commission to to do a thorough research on the on on the matter to that there's a limit on the number of appeals which an accused persons can can can explore and also you you you after the law Reform Commission H the portfolio committee on Justice and conal development can also start with that bill but it must also come from the Department of Justice because the department is responsible for legislation so the the department can also craft a draft bill which will through parliamentary processes by the portfolio committee and then the National Assembly and if the bill also affect the the National Council of provinces it will also go there for for for for also consideration so it is upon the the the the the the the legislative arm of government and also the Judiciary and also at the at the end is the executive will have the finaly to also approve the law in terms of the processes yeah so how will judge K's views apply when when you look at the Constitution the Constitution is famous for the human rights and and to balance that then the Constitution versus the human rights so judon views are not supported by the Constitution the Constitution is very clear that there is no limit on the side of the accused person if an accused person is not satisfied with a with a judgment he has a right to to appeal to every Forum which is available to him you will remember that if you are not satisfied with the decision of the magist Court you go to the high court if you are not satisfied you go to the Supreme Court of Appeal if if a matter raises a conal matter or it has a public interest you you you also go to the Cal court that is the current legisl that is the current legislative system so Jud proposals are just proposals which are not the law and it is up to the Judiciary to take into account the proposals and also up to the legislative arm of government to change the law to address those propos the proposals are progressive it will go a long way to ensure that those who violate our laws those who involved themselves in corruption they account to us in terms of how they theyve spent the public money especially cases involving corruption we have a challenge of of of of rooting corruption in the country and the reform of the law will go a long way to improve the status quo so that you find those accused persons successfully prosecuted senten and serve the prison sentence which will also serve as a deterrence of to others who might even want to commit crimes in future what do you think is the possibility that if if that law is crafted as as you explained to us that some accused who is not a rich or a famous person with lots of money will have his or her human rights then hampered limited remember the as much as you have the rights accused persons have the rights they also have a responsibilities remember these rights they comes with also the responsibilities it's not about limiting the rights it's about ensuring that there is no abuse of the right which is are genuine cases where the accused persons have a case to appeal and and I think those must be must be encouraged and and we only discourage those who use the money to challenge every judgment which is which is against them okay thank you so much for joining Jo us here this afternoon for your Insight that was advocate luno nond he is a constitutional law expert you're watching weekend review here on the sabc news channel and we'll see you right after this welcome back a memorial service was held yesterday in SOA for five children who died after allegedly eating food from a local spaza shop in Nal the children aged between 6 and 10 died After experiencing stomach cramps vomiting and drowsiness now the Ken legislature has called for strict enforcement of bylaws to prevent the sale of fake and expired Goods in spasa shops this as tensions have been high in the area as residents closed and looted foreign owned spasa shops now the sixth child who consumed the alleged poisoned food is fighting for his life in hospital we are joined this afternoon by the Ken MEC for economic development and finance leang M good afternoon and thank you so much for being with us today afternoon and thanks for having us before we we get into it I heard that you are going to visit SEO tomorrow can you tell us more about that well tomorrow there's a funeral um as you know of the uh deceased the five kids and we want to convey our condolences so we will uh visit I think later in the week um after the funeral because we don't want to um disrupt the funeral activities I think at this point all of us must focus on mourning and um respecting the families of the deceased and that's why we had um postponed the the visit okay so in the meantime the legislature's portfolio committee on community safety said that this tragic incident highlights the urgent need for stricter enforcement uh of the bylaws uh to prevent the sale of expired and harmful Goods uh of course particularly uh in in these Township areas are the preliminary investigations pointing to this as a cause well I I don't have details about the in investigations as yet but um we want to agree with the portfolio committee and I I think we need to make sure that we uh work with the communities and call on our communities especially those who own these shops because in most cases uh these shops um rented out to uh foreign Nationals uh some of whom don't have a um proper docu documentation by our residents so the reason why we want to visit so is because we want to have a conversation with the um the uh the locals and and then those who own the shops so that we can look at how do we help them to commercialize and make sure that they run these themselves so that you don't have a a problem of uh people who are illegal ending up running the shops and end up running illicit activities and we've seen tensions in this area before also in other parts of hting around these spaza shops there's a feeling that said that some of them operate with little or no monitoring by the metro police officers or the authorities do do you share that that sentiment yes yes I I do I do and that's why we have bought a a campaign called fix your business on because there's a lot of these shops and a lot of them don't even uh uh apply for for licenses and the municipalities in most cases and the authorities don't know of their existence so I do share that and and and and I think uh we have to move fast in making sure that we rate and we also identify those that are illegal and we certainly clamp down on them because if we don't it's not going to help the situation you will have these elicit activities you are not going to deal with unemployment you are also going to have these um dangerous products that are being sold uh because they want to buy cheap products so that they can make money and uh I think we we do share we do share the the sentiments of the of the committee so what is your approach then in terms of accountability um in preventing the continued sale of of goods such as that we have to make sure that the health uh compliance authorities of the municipalities do what they're supposed to do they work with the uh metrop police and other law enforcement agencies but we also need um the communities to play their part as well and that's why we are saying we have to make sure that we help them uh with the skills with the resources with the systems with the networks and that's the role that the government will have to play and we're prepared to play that role so everybody has got a role to play um the health authorities the law enforcement authorities the communities and government we all have to collaborate okay so um these people of of course they earn profits um despite the well-being of the community they're being endangered uh does your department have any idea how many of these spa shops there are and and what happens to the money does the money stay in the province of Hing does it leave the country and that's why I was relating to illicit trading meaning it's not legal so if it's not legal it means there's a lot of these P shops that are not registered therefore you wouldn't know how many are they and if they not registered it also means that the South African Revenue Services doesn't know of their existence and is not able to H collect taxes so we have to CL down on them because this is a lot of money and that is circulating okay let me ask you about the hospitals you've said that if theing government is not Vigilant with its finances particularly in relation to the Department of Health it could be bankrupt by 2020 5 so isn't the continued deaths and hospitalization of those victims of the contaminated foods and so on putting pressure on state resources even further well firstly we will never be Bank bankrupt as a provincial government because the finances are in good hands that's the first but we do have constraints because we have lost about 35 billion rent of our income and this 35 billion rent is as a result of the budget cuts that you have seen throughout the country about 15 billion of that and the 20 billion is um the eols so we are constrained and facing pressure and health and education are the two most um constrained areas because every year we have about 230,000 people coming to the province and uh all of them they need health services they need education so as you correctly say these um unfortunate incidents add to uh the pressure that the health system is plac is is facing so the National Health act mandates that all businesses uh dealing with food or other consumables must adhere to to strict health and safety standards is there a database of sorts of how many are in step with the Lord is there any way to know I think the only one the only know to know the only way to know is to firstly make sure that they register but secondly government has to be proactive and uh approach them and uh that's why one of the things we are doing is how can provinal government is to create a database of all businesses what by what and Street by strect um to know how many what activities are they engaged in so we have started with that process okay so there's been continued calls of course for the law enforcement agencies Metro Police and so on to conduct regular inspections to monitor the compliance of these shops what can your department do uh to tighten regulation to tighten oversight yeah well I think uh we we we have to work with the communities which is what we are doing and we have to because I think you we can't just uh put law in place um without uh Consulting with communities and without those laws um addressing uh specific issues so in this case um we need to know what is it that is wrong and what is it that the communities would want us to to regulate and we will uh play that role but in the meantime if you're not registered it means you're running an illegal business and if you're selling uh poisonous food it's it's it's it's it's just illegal um you don't even have to wait to uh introduce new law and all that for now we have to make sure that the laws that are there ER that are in place must be implemented what about using something such as the competition act which gives powers in terms of price discrimination and so on to to use that to to to pressurize uh these owners no you can but remember these guys are just small the price in most cases is for these big businesses that um squeezing out the smaller guys and all that so we must use all the different Avenues where where where where possible okay thank you so much for joining us here this afternoon and for your contribution today that's the hting Mec for economic development and finance leang M you're watching weekend review here on the Sab News Channel and we will see you right after this welcome back to week in review we're going to continue now with our conversation about the township businesses and to get the perspective of business owners and Township entrepreneurs we are speaking today to bulani balabala who is the founder of Township entrepreneur agency good afternoon and thank you so much for joining us here today uh good afternoon thank you so much for uh having us on the platform this uh afternoon today so with the high unemployment rates the High Cost of Living of course how many people go into entrepreneurship in townships uh because of these conditions in order to take part in the economy in that way no man I mean I think there quite a number of them I think when you sort of look at uh the report that was released about uh a few years ago you know just looked at the fact that there's over 1.8 million um in formal businesses right but in that in in itself is sort of a conservative number when you sort of look at the fact that we don't take into consideration number one um the individuals who are already in formal employment but uh taking on side hustles but also equally so the fact that there's very little data on um the ones who are actually operational within this market and I think really just the you know the nuanced in and around you know consistently utilizing the word informal you know because I think when you sort of look at this particular Market in in itself one of the most formal markets that you would ever come across which which which at the end of the day when you sort of unpack um the conversation around formalization you then find that you know there is no incentive for quite a number of these entrepreneurs that work in these spaces to you know to formalize purely because of the because of the way in which they're operating and how much revenue that they're generating at the end of the day it is believed that up to 70% of South Africans live in areas that have spaza shops of course now given the size of your membership what would you say is the size or the presence of the foreign owned shops in the townships and how does that impact on the local entrepreneurs no no I mean the Siz in itself is is is is tremendous I mean when you sort of look at um the work that we do across the country is the Nationwide work and then I think you look at the estimates that talk to the fact that this pezza shop or this pzza rate Market is worth well over 100 150 billion right you then start to understand um and when you actually look at some of the data as well that you know foreign Nationals have taken over quite a large chunk of that particular Market um in terms of operational right um within various communities and townships across the country even in some um me even in most rural communities um in and itself and I think really one of the big conversations um not even conversations but really the one of the big things that is needed I think from a government perspective is for them to really tighten up in regulations and policies but also equally so is also for them to also create an Ena environment for youth owned businesses to then also then Thrive because I think when they are able to consider markets or business avenues like your paa shops you know selling vages on the side of the road as a potential Avenue for them to actually transact and as business and itself in a conducive environment then we're able to grow a competing Nation where the young individual don't just look at a particular stream as a as as as a as a revenue generating stream but they can look at all opportunities that are available within this Market how would you be able to improve competitiveness in in this informal market and to make sure that there's not these huge discrepancies with prices the first one is you tap into what they've done and I think well you know we tap into what they've done I mean the buying power you know Mass buying power I think being able to mobilize people under under the umbrella of you know um collectively going to negotiate with the retailers right um because the retailers at the end of the day in the business of being able to drive their sales at the end of the day so if you are able to Cate these individuals under one umbrella and number one equal out the fact that you are trying to drive Revenue that's the first thing the second part is you know taking on a collaborative approach to the way in which business is done you know I think historically I think historically with individuals who grew up in the township I think similarly myself um when you sort of look at as puzzle shop you sort of looked at as puzzle shop as a business that was done by either your grandmother or someone older as a substance business but not one that but but not necessarily as a business that you would then go into which is why I think part of the part part of part of going out into the market to also then recondition individuals around where opportunities are you know in most cases we think that opportunities are in corner offices in Brinston but opportunities are in the township economy right um which is why I mean you sort of look at the estimates talking about the township economy being worth over 900 billion and we believe that that's a conservative number it's way was worth a little bit more than that right and I think as individuals who grew up within these markets or live within South Africa it's important for us to are you still there it seems as though the line is frozen there now it was quite an interesting conversation and we're trying to speak here to bulani balabala of Township entrepreneur agent it seems though it's frozen and we can't speak to him right now but what an interesting conversation about the township informal sector we continue with this story a Kimberly Runner

to the mall or just get out walk stop going to the park just look at yourself in the morning and and say look I have to do something about my you know my health problem there many many people I know they're not fit but yes by doing exercise walking walking around you know and park on is easy you don't have to be an athlete or or or or a somebody who is fit any shape any doesn't matter just go and walk and you you're going to be happy you made it you start your your weekend like newborn thank you very much the only problem I'm seeing we need especially parents must bring their kids here the school should come here you know they must I'm sure there's many many kids you know instead of coming here sitting at home 9:00 on the table and playing with the computers the parents should bring the kids out there must take them out and lock the doors they go out and play and go do some sport but the parents are not doing it it's you need more youngsters to come to to park and to sport maybe sorry maybe I should be the sports Minister and take over from from the minister no okay thank you talking about uh taking over from gon McKenzie Sports Minister saying that uh you know just get up and and and start running of course saying also that it's very important for for young children to also um start on this fitness journey and start running but uh since the November uh 2011 so it's

did not rehear that it was coming from the heart so men the celebrity is still one to me and this is what she said we so but we part as a family for one moment and the reason we proud Des SP is so

hallah e e e am am Romans Hallelujah one or without Hallelujah Island Premier Hallelujah number1 report of the my e e mer you to go e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e um good morning all um I would like to greet you all um and observe also all protocols that are in the house um according to your to your structures um we we would like to take you through a journey of the passing of baba um I think for the family it's important that um can we please have some silence in the house please okay for the family it's important that we deliver this message so that we narrow down the narratives that are out there in the media space um so so therefore we felt the need to to take the whole country into the journey that we all went through um on the 25th of August um it was a Sunday morning when we received a call from the management team saying that uh papa is in hospital but he's in a stable stable State um after receiving the call we immediately called the phone of Papa to check if he is okay but unfortunately it was answered by one of the management team members while they they were in bwana they further communicated with us uh during the course of the Sunday and also during in the course of the Monday morning and afternoon in terms of the medical condition of Pap um on Monday while in bana we we could talk to Papa over the phone and he told us that he's okay but with a faded voice we then uh went through the whole of Monday morning and Monday afternoon and Monday evening communicating with the management team in bwana and Bara through the phone on Tuesday morning when my my my wife called me while I was at work saying that look can we go to Wana and fetp we we didn't hesitate we immediately drove to bwana with a view and vision that we will'll be coming back with Papa in the same car uh we drove to buwana on the Tuesday Tuesday Morning um through the tedious roads that that we encountered and landed in bwana on the same night but in the evening while in bwana that evening unfortunately we could not go immediately into hospital because of obviously Hospital times we therefore slept at ban on the Tuesday and followed on the following day on Wednesday to the hospital early early in the morning when we got to the hospital in mwana um I must also thank also the management team that stayed with Baba from from Sunday up until we arrived in busana um when we got to bwana's hospital uh Baba was already in the hospital there uh for about 2 days the first encounter was with the with the doctors of bwana and it's important that we share the message so that we we you understand the journey that we took and the mental strain and the family took hence there were no communication about this the first encounter was with the doctors ofana which told us that uh Papa was Papa came to the hospital on on Sunday he seemed to be according to their wordss and I quote in a state of drunkness and we were all shocked together with the management team um the do same doctor examined him the next day and then he still concluded with the same comments that your father looks a bit drunk and it's two days in hospital we asked the doctor how is it POS possible that a man in your care seems a little bit drunk what diagnosis have you given to date and unfortunately there hasn't been a diagnosis in Botswana we therefore took a quick decision while in bwana to say that look this is a critical situation we need to take Papa back to South Africa while going to his word we found Papa sitting in a w um alongside the two members of his of his management team and the first words that he said when he saw her daughter coming in was that don't cry my daughter why are you crying it was because of it was the first time that we see him in that state we've never seen him in that state following that um we therefore organized with the South African hospitals to arrange a bed so that we can immediately transfer Papa from bwana to South Africa um it's unfortunate to say that there were no examinations or M MRI scans or any sort of medical intervention that the that the hospital did that site hence we we took him to the nearest nearest Private Hospital that we that we can find which was in rastenberg immediately when we got to Arenberg um the phys the Physicians and the medical team there quickly um looked at Papa and then diagnosed him that he had a he had a Stoke and with that said um they quickly had to do a brain operation um on that on that day we we managed to do the brain operation at the the private institution after doing the brain operation Papa was obviously admitted into ICU uh for a period of time unfortunately the first operation was not successful and we needed now to do another operation that's when we pleaded to the public at large pleaded to the communities pleaded to South Africans to say that yes we have undergone the first operation the public can you assist us with funds and unfortunately the funds that were required and that were were donated it was not even a quarter of what was required for the operation and we had to take an emotional decision also again as a family to say that we need to move Papa to a public institution so that we can um continue with the second operation we then moved Papa to a public uh institution in ring an academic institution whereby they performed a second operation on him on that second operation um it was hopeful and very positive on the second time in terms of the doctor's report that we received it's important also to note that and say that during this time while in ICU all the medical staff Papa prayed for them he was singing with the medical staff while he was in ICU singing for them and also praying for them while in ICU he said that to us that bag I've heard everything you've said while I was in an ined home thank you for the efforts that you have done he was getting better while in a public institution and he was moved to a normal w we asked the question as a family to say that for us he still looks critical why are you moving him out of ICU they said they needed space um in ICU they took him to award and I feel that as a family for us to correct or for us as South Africans to self correct we need to reflect and tell it like it is we while going into the words I can put it under oath here now that there is no cleaner in that word it was a shocking state of state that we've ever seen in our life that is it really a medical facility that we're seeing here has there been cleaners in this facility and my answer and conclusion to that was no and I feel not feel but it's important for me to say these things because of we need to save the next life if you don't say it people will never correct that behavior and unfortunately this is the only platform that I have or that we have as a family rather while in that same same word uh Papa picked up a bacteria in fact I need to go back to the Sunday before the the Sunday when we got called in that the doctors was calling us at 1:00 a.m. in the night saying that they need to do another operation on B and we quickly asked what operation are you doing now they said no there's something in the stomach I'm saying but what is something in the stomach no answer given immediately the next day Monday morning we quickly go to the public institution as we're doing on daily basis and we found that no the operation is not necessary anymore um he's got a bug infection that he picked up in the hospital and he needs to be put in isolation we asked the doctors how is it possible that we get this bug they telling us that the only way he could have picked up the buck is in hospital because of the hygiene conditions we saw Papa deteriorating from a good heart r you know fighting we we speaking to him on a daily basis that Papa please fight and he couldn't move the only movement he did was his head and nodding and telling us yes I'm fighting but unfortunately he was moved back into ICU after they could not treat the infection that he picked up in hospital while in ICU he made make sure that he waits for his daughter my wife's birthday and also the younger sister's birthday he passed on the day after the younger sister's birthday and it was a sad situation for the family so in so saying um South Africans and family and we were very much as a family when we asked for donations of an icon and the public did not respond and we need to put it out there and I would like to also acknowledge JJ for the contribution Professor JJ for the contribution he did on his show we we tend to celebrate people and fill up balls and demand to be in programs while people are dead but when they are life we don't celebrate those people we don't Embrace those legends that we should be embracing a community saves lives I'm not saying that we should do it for Papa I'm saying that we as a community we should all look out for each other when there's help needed next door or front opposite you let's all stand up and give that help that's required uh you will hear many speakers come today and telling you how Papa lives this life he will always share his last ENT with somebody that needs it and he would not even have money himself if he went to if he went to a shop to go buy something and somebody ask him for money he will give him that last money and not even come back with the bread that he promised that that will come with that's the type of person that he was yes indeed we did require 700,000 of of surgery and like I said we only managed to raise 100,000 out of South Africa it's a sad situation for the family uh we've been through a traumatic time that's why we have not spoken about this on any publication or to anybody but I would like to also acknowledge the the leadership of Aisa when they when they heard the call that papa is noral they were the first actually to jump and say look as the music union industry what where can we do and where can we help today is a state funeral um with that being said the the approval only came yesterday midday all the resources that you seeing here were done by the family at the back of their minds they still have depths of the private institution that they were at at the back of their minds we still have depths of the government institution the academic institution that was helping Papa to have the second operation we didn't even know that we pay at government institutions Mama we given a bill of 93,000 at a government institution 93,000 I've never heard of that before no one actually told us that we're going to pay if we had to pay 93,000 we would have kept papa for that duration in a private institution and we would not have picked up that infection he would have been kept in the ICU where he would have been monitored on a 24-hour basis South Africans that's how we lost Bara um there are many articles out there that is not the truth some have even buried him last week some have even buried him last month but he fought a good seven weeks while in hospital in a hospital bed and I'm extremely proud of that man every time I walked into that IC unit I told him the same way Pap I'm proud of you I don't think there's any man that can stand this pain but he did it for a full seven weeks South Africans that's all that we that that we want to say we acknowledge the dignitaries that are also

mam he passed on tour Brasi was a great icon for all of us but more Brasi was a big brand and thank you so much to the young people that revived the brand and D was already performing in clubs before he passed I want to leave the family with few words or three to be exact firstly as the music industry we've listened and had all the the tongue lashes from the memorial service that artist in this country all the time when they in difficulties be it ill ailing or death we tend to be in difficult situation as EO we have called our own government and we are glad that the leadership is here that we are requesting that with all the funding agencies that are funding Festival shows and everything else please convert only one and make it a funding agency that will take care of the welfare the sick and the old in the music industry we are requesting that the story of the family that we could not afford just a mere operation cost must be a a thing of the past we are also requesting that our own very artists like solim mulu who have laid a solid rock that the family must step in in the business of you must know has created compositions that according to our copyright law n owns those compositions for over 50 years if we look at the current bill or law copyright law those compositions will be owned for over 70 years focus on that business M we are here I was happy to see Sean from Sony who stood up and said I was with so the first appointment when everybody is gone should be a meeting with the record company let us understand what is the value and the weth of solim compositions so that for the next 50 years reward him let me close with the words and say to the family Lani we are here to support you it is often a case that we forget our mama we are here as Echo we stand and say ourself AA leadership we will be with you to ensure still reward and support the children that are here let's celebrate solely he was the biggest brand we ever imagined as we celebrate 30 years of our democracy so liulu of all in the last two months we've been bearing as many we thinking that God has a plan so for us we say leadership you died with your mic on but your legacy will not be in vain thank you very much all right I Papa ladies and gentlemen Ajani e e e e e e e e e e e yes today we here to to celebrate a a life that is well Leed and the children our deepest condolences to you for the loss of your husband your father and a a pillar of your family solu did what many Christians fail to do which is to go and make the whole world Jesus disciples the problem with Christians sometimes is that they tend to preach to the converted and so they they they form churches as some kind of clubs you know exclusive clubs they even fight there if you think the politics within the ANC and so on are bad just go to a church it's worse it's worse that than the politics because they are fighting over Church fans being on the Council of the church it it has become a small club that has lost its Mission the mission is to go out there and make all mankind Jesus disciples and this what he did because in a recent podcast he was asked don't you mind that people are playing your music in in in tens he says no that's exactly where that music is needed it's exactly because I better get my my things straightened and when we come to a funeral sometimes it's less about the person who has passed away but more about us whether we we are ready to learn that our day is also coming and whether or not when that day comes will be ready to face our maker and answer whether we did what his mandate is what what is called in the Bible the Great Commission go out there and make a whole of humankind my disciples so that way we can say soim hu you have fought a good fight you have run a good race you have kept the faith and each of us must ask ourselves the question if when you leave this Hall you drop dead will you be ready to face your maker but that's not what I wanted to talk about I wanted to get that out of the way and just talk about the fact that this Society has failed so it it's a simple as that a couple of weeks ago there was a a white chap called Tom Tom London he was in a public Hospital uh I think was Helen Joseph hospital and he was disgusted by the treatment he got there he made a very big Noise Within 2 days and I don't even have to tell you who gave him money but he was in the private hospital having raised 300,000 RS to move from Helen Joseph to a private hospital so the question is as black people have we given up on ourselves for self-determination that even someone who's an icon our icon we fail to raise 700,000 rents with all the stock fails we have all the businesses we have all the be deals that the NC has given you there was nobody who could just sign a check of what what are these be people because we understand the be has been very successful there are 1,000 black H what do you call it black industrialist but it was not enough to Save a Life of somebody who's an icon I think this is a bloody shame it's a total shame and I didn't even know half of the story that we were told here today about the fact that even after moving him to a private public facility it became worse it became worse when are we going to stand up as a black nation and understand that we are on our own I I cannot believe that somebody as prominent as solu all of us could not raise 700,000 r with all the spor shops we own all the businesses we own all the Professionals in high ranking jobs CEOs of companies nobody nobody was shaken enough to say let's put this money there of course life is not guaranteed other people say yeah no no no we don't know even if we pay the money he may still have passed no no no the reason you have hospitals is to make sure you do not have people passing unduly early that's why otherwise you not have doctors doctors are there to save lives and unfortunately those things cost money I'm even shocked that now you even received a bill of 93,000 rent from a public facility I hope meani will take that up this is a total shame it shouldn't happen but to to to just fathom the fact that as a black nation forget about other people we could not Rally together right to Save a Life that we so adore and it's this tendency it's a tendency to to like funerals I don't know where this tendency comes from so the government agreed yesterday that oh there'll be a provincial funeral oh let me tell you without even having the facts that I'm sure that cost of that designation as a official fer will cost Millions it will cost four times what you could have spent to Save a Life of a person now you come and you must ulate that you have now made it the provincial funeral no this is nonsense it is nonsense and we must not tolerate the society two days ago I think malama was talking about a black company called drip drip yeah drip I I tried to support them and when I went to try and get another PIR I found their shop closed in s and all they need is 20 million Rand not to get into trouble we've got IDC nef pic we've got all these organizations that are meant to support black organizations that are failing in their basic duty to support black businesses so it's not an isolated thing to say oh they failed to support soan I'll will come to the artist now because also it's not a complete story to just blame government we we also need to say and I'm not sure whether the minister of arts and culture is here because it's quite loud but we want to see whether that loudness will translate into action why is there no program to support artists to turn their art into business and they they given support so that they're able to manage their finances they able to actually make a success of those businesses I'm not aware of a solid program like that if it's there it's too quiet and hopefully that Minister besides the gimmicks of of of of what do you call I don't know this cars this where they do this cars that they buttered cars and without those gimmicks can we just talk about taking care of our artists I'm sure there's a speech somewhere that's already drafted about artists dying as purpose and the minister looks like he's waiting for an artist to die and then he takes out their speech and say our artist should not die as Pop theyve been saying that since Paul mashad was minister of arts and culture every single minister of art and culture has said something like that but zero action zero now now coming to the artists the artist must also take responsibility because there are some artists who when they receive a big check they go and blow it all on cars and be shoes and other things and then at the end of the day so we this thing is a societal issue of Attitude Change for all of us government must do its job Society must wake up and realize that we are on our own then the artists themselves must understand that generally nobody owes you anything you got to be responsible you get two rent pay your medical Aid in advance you know you get some gig save invest so that your children don't starve when you are gone right but my underlying message is a simple one we have failed solim Hulu as this nation and we must hang in shame and so what M was saying is true a number of sabc radio stations must call them out Sac was not playing the music of Sol they playing every minutes because we've got a tendency to celebrate people after their demise when they alive we don't give them their flowers it's a total shame actually to find that the public broadcaster that supposed to elevate our icons doesn't do that because everybody now is playing the music every corner you hear the music everywhere we've got to wake up as a society and understand that we are on our own to build this nation so that all of us can enjoy the fruits of our freedom so liulu you have done your part you fought a good fight go well my brother uh JJ Tani I think he was vocal before is so um JJ it's just that unfortunately you know why applic arti we are on our own it be all right out to accept family Solomon MAF mulani was born on the 15th April 1959 at mtiv start in the Northwest Province he

KGRwZ07iwDc,Lusikisiki Mass Murder | Mourners bid their loved ones farewell,2024-10-12T10:50:46Z,8954,all right um my colleague fund has been giving us coverage from lambasi Village in the Eastern Cape and what we're showing you on the right there as the first in fact the second coffin has now being lowered of the sing family who also part of the victims of this mass murder in goana village in Lu and also on your left we have the funeral service in Petoria of gospel great tributes continue to be paid to this Legend and we're now going to take you live to quala in the Eastern Cape where other members part of the 18 that were gunned down inana Village are also Al being laid to rest this morning all right let's go now to sabc news reporteri who is at the other Funeral Service morning to you paint a picture for us of what is taking placea and um thank you very much people are being laid to thank you very much Cela yes we are coming live from guaba Village this is where four members of this Bara family have been already laid to rest you remember that the incident that occurred just last week whereby these people were guned down but today we are at the funeral and then you can see the visual there of the people who are distracted about what actually happened you remember that these people were the mothers were brothers sisters and they also played a crucial role in making sure that they raised their family but today here we are they are being buried to rest you remember that this morning we started by taking the family members to a scene whereby they were gunned down then ritual there was performed uh because it is according to the African culture and tradition that Spirit of the Dead is taken from the crime scene so that it doesn't maybe TR those who are left behind and also according to the tradition these the the diseased are also taken back home so that they can communicate well with the members of the family today we are here at guala Village these here are still with disbelief what actually happened some of these family members left their children alone while many now will have absolutely no parents left behind the fineral service is underway and we understand that the government of the eastn C played a crucial role in making sure that these families receive a decent feral we understand also that the P of the Eastern Camp has already arrived at one of the F at lambas a village just outside Lu where 11 people were buried were laid to rest difficult time for many families if my camera operator can just maybe pen inside the tent all this this is as a result of criminal activities that continues to hot at the province of the Eastern Cape you remember remember that has been always characterized by such incidents we know that almost each and every week a family is bearing a loved one especially women women are being graped children are being graped and what is confusing in many occasions that no one is brought to book and answer for the criminality that has been that has been done but today family members traditional leaders different congregations have gathered here to beat farewell to the members of the of the of the Mar family so many people ask themselves questions as to how long this will take how long this criminality will continue to haunt the the Eastern C Province as much as the rural areas people feel not safe they are forced by the circumstances to lock their doors because when you go to bed you don't know whether you'll see the next day the level of crime is high drug abuse is a problem most of the people associate all these criminalities to joblessness unemployment young people now indulge in drug abuse and continue to commit crimes of this nature nobody knew that one day the province of the Eastern Cape South Africa will be mourning the death of 18 parents fathers Mothers Daughters even a 2 months year old baby we were told that one of the mothers here 2 months old baby was retrieved from the hands of a lifeless body of a mother very bad scene experence would like to my colleague where four family members are being laid to rest as well one can but only imagine the pain and suffering of those in attendance still waiting for answers together with an entire nation that exactly what led to such brutality will'll also show you pictures of those who were gun down in this tragedy quala in the Eastern Cape those alive visuals where four family members are being buried the bottom of your screen on the left in lambasi in the Eastern Cape also fall being buried there the third of the fourth coffin has already been lowered the the Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Maan has arrived at lambasi to also pass his condolences and share in the grief of these families senseless tragic unacceptable are words that we've heard being echoed over the past couple of days as at this stage just one suspect has been arrested in this matter all these families want is closure about why Lydia Tanda being one of those one of the S family members you can see there another sing family member where my colleague fundis is in lambasi Tamara vimba being one of the victims of this tragedy Anita Deo we've also had this one before one of the family members also being laid to rest there that's where my colleague as I indicated is M Faith it's one of the victims of the senseless mass murder perhaps at this time we could possibly take you back let's take you back to quala in the Eastern cake yes CA as you can see sness s to some tears are written on their faces it's a tragedy that no one can believe we just had a time to speak to to the member of the family all right uh we're monitoring quite a number of uh key stories that we covering uh for you at this stage we do apologize for a bit of that uh a break in our sound there as we try to bring you this live coverage let's go back to guaba yes as I was saying that you can see that these moas here you can see that they really they are experiencing this uh incident or this funeral of the four members of the of the the M family with disbelief we saw a number of them looking at the at the program looking at the pictures some shaking their heads because they couldn't believe what has just we spoke to the member of the to the members of the family or the spokesperson of the family Mr M he was is telling us that these were the pillars of this family of the M family these were the people that contributed in this Village to make sure that at least there is development and stuff but today they have just perished through of course the barrel of the gun incidents that continues to haunt the Eastern Cape Province it's always characterized by horrible sins of this nature you know that as we are bearing these four members at lambas they also bearing 11 of them at one Village also three members will be buried so the province is covered with dark clouds and continues to be haunted by such incidents everybody here is complaining about crime High rate of crime you remember that just two years ago luiki was rated number one in the country as a rape Capital rape Capital where women are raped children are raped and no one is being arrested for that the arrest of a suspect who appeared on Tuesday maybe one will say it's a breakthrough but the village is here they don't believe he will be found guilty and sentence and Justice be served but all these family members here they want Justice they want to know why their family members were brutally killed why their were killed why their mothers were brutally killed fathers Sons and Daughters It's Only Yesterday where we bearing king and the family there was distracted and they were also asking questions why why why why is C is always characterized by brutal killings of this nature you will also remember that just few days ago immediately after the bring of 18 people another incident of brutal kill 200 km away from where we are right now six members perished there and it was it wasn't the first incident also people continues to leave to to lose their loved ones
6Z3LTFODqoQ,Lusikisiki Mass Murder | EC Premier pays tribute to the victims,2024-10-12T10:39:18Z,2977,let's take you live back to lambasi and that's of course where others are being laid to rest today my colleague fundis has been there we also saw the premier of The Province Oscar mabuyane who arrived to cry I guess with the families of those who lost their loved ones for I understand you're standing by with Premier Oscar Maan indeed chriselda we are standing with the premier of theab we have just witnessed the burial of four family members of the S household uh they were part of the 18 people who were killed last week at goana Village we saw very harrowing scenes very agonizing devastating scenes of the burial of four family members four family members in one day but the premier is here Premier you have just witnessed the burial of four family members what came through your mind very sad I must say probably allow me to firstly convey our message of condolences uh to all these families that have lost their their loved ones the 18th families as you would know that the other one has been buried yesterday King family I I still uh reach out to the King's family I had a discussion with King's family when we met them but also I want to reach out to the families in gobu of those cpf members that lost their loved ones as well but also this morning we woke up again on other sad news of a car accident that took place between du and Matata where we also lost about seven lives and nine currently in hospital so we are really really conveying our heartfelt dep pest condolences to all these families we have never experienced what we're experiencing in the province losing such number of lives almost at the same time here we are now as you say uh very terrible uh actually uh something that is really were not really um used to to see about four Coffs at the same time as as we as we stand here the matu family across the luiki town is also having four bodies uh that are also being buried as we speak it's a terrible it's a terrible thing that we wish it will never happen again where we lose these kind of lives in this kind of manner I'm quite happy that um police have managed uh to uh find a suspect and I'm happy now that the suspect is also uh directly linked uh to this situation and I know police are also looking for three that now they've got a proper lead too so we quite happy as Minister said we know whom we are looking for and definitely we need to close this chapter it can't continue in the manner in which it is Set set set indeed you see this somber moment here but we're here to strengthen the families we're here to strengthen the community it's no longer about these families it's about these families I had an opportunity to speak to Lulu a young girl who lost his father uh the third cofin here is is his father H she's here to actually also see what she would probably never thought about these are really really um terrible situation that we don't wish to see again happening in our Province you just spoke about the police and strengthening their work um people here have been complaining about respon that is very low and uh is very slow rather and that they take time and uh they think that the criminals are now targeting rural areas because they believe that they are soft targets to them what can you say in terms of the police now taking Swift action to attend to crime scenes police are are trying their level best I I can't I can't be unfair on them and I've been working with them but uh the setup in rural areas makes it very difficult for every kind of government Service uh to be uh offered to our people we've got one police station here that is in town that must be able to service these rural communities it's not easy to move from town to here and the challenges that you see so but police are doing their level best but now it's a wake up call now we realize that we've got to change laws we've got to change uh regulations and how we've been working it's a similar situation when you go to health where you say uh people must be in a radius of 20 km people has been a radius of 10 km Etc in terms of demarcation it's no longer that situation we have said so th criminals have found Eastern Cape as a refugee camp they can easily come here and hide you know most of them are coming from this province they go away here we talk about someone who is alleged to have done this thing who once killed the police who was arrested was sentenced uh for life and spent more than 20 years in jail the person just finishes one year in his in his parole he's alleged to have committed a similar situation again so it's a serious situation that we must look deeper not only here but of course we must make this reflection having seen what we have seen But it tells you how uh Correctional our correctional centers are if you can have someone in 20 years in Correctional Services but that person comes back encourageable so these are things that we've got to look deeper as government and begin to say are we really really getting to the bottom of Crisis that we have the societal ills you can see this kind of a moral Decay that is happening in our communities Etc so we've got to work together as communities households traditional leaders Civil Society government to make sure that we put a stop on this things like this must not happen in rural areas we we not used into things like this so they it used to be a taboo even to rape a woman it used to be taboo if you have done that thing you'll be isolated in a community but now these things are common we know drugs are being planted all over in our rural communities so these are not happening out of human No Ordinary human beings this has got something it's a really phenomenal phenomenon that we've got to look at it broadly and begin to find proper Solutions and answers to the ongoing problem because indeed our people are no longer safe our people are not enjoying their lives as they used to enjoy their Liv in rural areas and the more we bring development you understand here this is a kind of a noal point we talk about 8 billion and but also the road that Lings up to East Lon it happening here we are really turning the Green Field here into a brown field so these kind of developments attracts a lot of things that are coming all over so these are really issues that we've got to to deal with we would have wanted to S our people happy to see a lot of this kind of windfall of development happening while they still alive if they if we lose them it's unfortunate Premier you mentioned the kumu uh Massacre because six people died there and the issue of stock theft comes more often when these things happen what can you say about the issue of stock theft that seems to be getting out of hand in the Eastern Cape it has really been happening I'm not sure getting out of hand it's a correct statement probably we have really been not H doing much uh but we've been doing the best again the issue of resourcing the kind of facilities that we have to deal with issues of stock theft I can tell you proval commissioner knows there is no single week that I would not be talking to her about the issues of stock theft and how I would want police reinforcement more uh training around stock theft getting more people but I'm seeing a lot few days ago I saw some lot of rid that was happening where these animals were also found and collected by their own people stock T has been a problem K Mount FR and as well ASO that belt but it's not only there if you go to B the problems that we had in P for long we're also revolving around stock theft almost in all rural areas H wherever you are there will be even if it is at the minimal scale stock theft has been a problem and this the economy of our own Ordinary People where they reside they don't have any anything else they are using this kind of um uh the livestock to look after their lives so we do condemn uh these kind of things but I'm happy that police are responding and now we have got more resources more deployment that we have been crying for as the provinal government of Eastern Cape now National has actually put us under microscopic view and I'm quite happy with that we're welcoming it and we going to definitely deal with these kind of problems as we move forward thank you very much the premier of the Eastern Cape Mr Oscar Maan echoing what Mr David King said yesterday during the funeral service of Ruth King H he was saying that he is disappointed that this crime this horrific crime harrowing crime was allegedly committed by someone who was who is a convicted criminal who was that then released on parole chela all right fund thank you very much indeed speaking to the premier of the Eastern Cape Province Oscar Maan is speaking on a number of issues including that horrific accident that uh uh had taken place on the end to near Tata as well um several lives had been lost there a little bit earlier on this morning we did speak to the transport authorities there
HjuHrNTuO8I,Lusikisiki Mass Murder | Funeral service of mass shooting victims in progress,2024-10-12T10:37:37Z,12213,"foree to oh take it well chriselda as you just heard thank you chrisa as you have just heard there's a a chopper that just landed we don't know whether there's a government official from National that is arriving we are also seeing the vehicles medical rescue vehicles from the Department of Health they are also here the family has just uh put the coffins of the deceased here at the grave site they are now speaking over the fourth coffin they have just put next to the headstone they are doing the ch performing the church rituals earlier on the members of this family were saying that they are very destroyed they are very devastated agonized by what has happened and they were begging urging government officials to make sure that police are visible in their Villages because they believe that criminals are now targeting rural areas because of their inaccessibility knowing that if they commit crime it will take long for the police to reach the crime scenes earlier on here as the hses brought the bodies we saw family members breaking down to tears crying they couldn't bear to see their loved ones being brought home and earlier on were at the muary at the kuma funeral pal after that they took the bodies to the crime scene at goana Village where they they talked to The Souls of the deceased remember these families had moved to goana Village years and years ago but today instead of being buried at Village they are now being buried here in their ancestral home of lambasi because we heard after the incident took place that the the families May dit that those two household that they may leave them because they felt like those Homestead are doomed so that is why they are moving the the their bodies the bodies of their loved ones here at lambas Village which is on the other side of town because remember goana is on the other side side of town next to the town of luiki whereas lambas is kilometers away maybe around 50 to 60 kilm from the town of L A far flank Village on a gravel road so the families are devastated they say they will only rest when the perpetrators are brought to to book and they are happy now that there is a suspect who has been arrested and is in custody for the alleged Murs Mass Murs of the goana 18 remember but there's also a funeral that is taking place or rather the burial of the three duza family members not far from where we are right now they are also here at lambas Village not so far from us it's just that this terrain here is very bad though we are closer to them it's very difficult to see them due to the trees and bushes that surround this area so as soon as they finish here they will then move to the m a huge M that is erected just outside the premises of the S family they will then move there the tuuza family will also be there because after they finish bearing the three family members they will then move to the s household where the S family members are also being buried today we hear that the premere is also attending we have seen the officials from the office of the Premier but we haven't seen the premier himself we have seen leaders from the local from the local government as well as the district that is the O Tambo District municipality we also expect to see the community safety MEC Mr this is quite a moving burial we saw family members crying couldn't bear to see their loved ones being brought in in four hes the F the first coffin has just been lowered and now they are coming to the three that are yet to be lowered earlier on when we spoke to the family members they were saying that they wish to see police visibility in their areas and that the police must work with them when they report crimes to them and they must be very Swift in taking action when they call them to come to the crime scenes because they believe that sometimes these crimes take place when they shouldn't have taken place due to the slow action or rather response from the police earlier on the family spokesperson Mr said that they cannot let the family members or anyone else by the way to to view the bodies because they could already see that the members of the family were already SED disheartened by seeing just the hses as well as the coffins being brought in so they could just imagine what could happen if they let them view the bodies we are here to see the lowering of the three other coffins we are at the S household here at lambas Village The ancestral home of the S family members who were guned down 2 weeks ago atana Village as they prepared for the cleansing ceremony of three other family members who were murdered in this manner a year ago in

RfPV_eFlPSE,Lusikisiki Mass Murder | Funeral service of 11 victims at Lambasi village underway,2024-10-12T09:14:08Z,8424,all right so 16 of the 18 people that were gunned down inana Village in Luigi two weeks ago are being buried this morning yesterday the family of the victims held a night vigil they say they fear for their safety and had to wait for police before proceedings began sabc news reporter fund has been in one of the areas for us in fact in lambasi village where 11 of the victims are being buried sis fund thank you very much indeed your time this morning it must be incredibly heartbreaking for these families where you're standing at the moment is the final resting place for some of these victims of this mass murder could you paint a picture for us of what you've seen since this morning this must be incredibly hard for this community indeed chrysa it is really hard for this community of lambas Village the community of goana Village earlier on we went to the m where the families were collecting the bodies of their loved ones then taking them to the uh crime scene where they were going there to uh take their souls and speak to them telling them that even though they were supposed to be buried at goana Village they are now going back to their ancestral home which is where we are right now gooa I mean rather H lambas village where right now there's a a prayer service that is taking place uh community members are streaming in moners are streaming in residents as well as the families of those that were killed atana Village are streaming in right now we are at the symmetry of the of the uh Family household we these four and as you can see behind me there are four um tombstones or rather there are four gra that have been H dug here at the Garden of the S household where these four bodies are supposed to be buried today but we spoke earlier on with the family members of the S household where they were saying that they don't feel safe yesterday they were supposed to be holding a night visual but they couldn't until the police were present because they say they are still feeling scared even today they stay they say they still feel as scared they don't feel safe because they don't know what will happen they are in rather urging government to make sure that there is police visibility in these rural areas because they believe criminals are now targeting rural areas because they say that rural areas are inaccessible because they say that they know that the police take long to come and attend to the crime scenes the other one was saying that they don't feel safe as the family they are urging the police to be working with them in order to arrest those they but they also found solace in knowing that there is a suspect that appeared in court on Tuesday for the alleged murder of these uh 18 people and they are hoping that he will reveal the names of those he worked with or those who sent them to kill yesterday we were speaking to the son of n n who was shot last year and he was saying that he is still traumatized by what he saw because he was present when his mother was shot along with his uh cousin usin who was also heavily pregnant at that time so it's three people who were killed last year from the S household you must imagine how traumatic this must be for them a year later they are bearing four or of their members today here at lambas Village Crystal fund as these funeral services take place uh you did indicate already that the community is still fearing for their lives has there been any change you've spent quite some time there now since this incident from what you have gauged has there been any a change in terms of the police presence or visibility in these areas because quite clearly this is a community that continues to live in absolute fear while one suspect has been arrested um it's not known at this particular stage where the more will be from the day I was here uh last week uh on Tuesday we saw people we saw the police vans moving around even yesterday when we were here we saw two police vehicles around here and all our way as it was getting darker after we realized that the night visil will not take place until the police come as we were driving back to town we met two police F that were coming this side so the the the residents the community as well as the are saying that what they see now is what they hope to see in the future not only because there's this uh tragedy that happened here but they must happen on a daily basis to make sure that the residents are safe the communities are safe and everyone is safe in this Village of lambas not only in this Village of lambas but in the whole of Ina Hill because there there's a lot of mess matters that are taking place in inua Hill local municipality which includes as well as Flex staff and just talk to us about you know what the families have been saying in the runup to this fundis because while um they do indicate as you say that would want to see this kind of police visibility even way after uh you know the situation or all of this uh you know has been uh dealt with and the spotlight with then off be off this particular area uh what is it that they want in addition to police visit ability I can only but imagine I'm quite uh familiar with the territory where you are and some of these Villages are quite far flung perhaps satellite police station that could also be there what is the talk around that apart from just having these patrols that we're seeing now indeed Crystal that the community want to be safe they want the police to be present in their areas but most importantly they say they want to work with the police yesterday as I was saying that we spoke to the son of one of the victims he was saying that he is not happy with the way the police are handling the matter because he says he gave the police who were investigating the killing of his mother as well as his cousin and the information that he gave them he doesn't think that it was being used in investigating the murder of his mother because he says that the police were asking him questions in front of the people that he was suspecting are involved in the killing of his mother and he is also saying that as he saw his mother being killed the police did not work with the family or rather did not inform the family as to how the investigation is going on and yesterday for the first time as you know Chris that we were still wondering what could uh what could happen what could cause people ble to kill such a number of people in one day and the son of n Niko who was murdered yesterday I mean rather last year he was saying that his mother was being accused of practicing witchcraft he told us yesterday and he believes that it's the people who were accusing his mother of practicing witchcraft so he's believing that the police if they can work with the community and try to solve these murders starting from the murder of his mother to this current murder maybe they will find peace knowing that the perpetrators are brought to book yeah this is certainly something that police would need to follow up on aunda relating to exactly what could have led to the cause of this uh Massa murders and certainly there seems to be an issue relating to crime in that particular area we're hoping that police would certainly be able to get to the bottom of all of that so that these families are able to find closure we'll cross to you a little bit later on once again thank you very much indeed in lambasi village where the funeral service of 11 victims is currently underway of course you'd recall that one of the victims was also buried yesterday all right

devastating for this particular family but again it raises a general concern that has been in the spotlight of bullying well indeed uh chrisa you'll remember that you know it's it's very painful uh you know to be bullied by a teacher and we understand that I can tell you that currently now the funeral service of Joseph Maya is currently underway after committing suicide you know this past week you know following that incident of bullying by the school teachers and I can tell you that what what what really happened is that um there are allegations that his um you know progress report was posted um you know on the in the classrooms and it was posted in the staff room and it was paraded around the school and as a result of that he couldn't you know uh take it easy and subsequent to that he committed suicide but I can tell you that now I'm joined here by the sgb chairperson thank you so much for joining us here on Sac news I just want to take um this opportunity uh to get your reaction as the SGP regarding what has really transpired at K Secondary School yeah um what have happened really as some of the things are still allegations and we are happy that the Department of Education they have interv they are busy with the investigation but uh on the side of the sgb we we are really really really not happy should we found that the allegations are really correct whereby we will gather as the sgb uh with the help of the Department of Education of course to deal with the matter uh at the moment uh uh we having a problem with our lers whereby they are really not taking this uh it is not easy for them it is not easy for them all of them they are not coping hence uh we we we going into the final trial whereby uh we really do not know if we going to make it as a school but we hoping that uh God will be with us God will give us blessings in order for the Learners to write their Trail exam and uh they can also pass through this year okay I I just want to find out here because you you are saying that Learners are not taking this matter very easy and of course it is a devastating issue to to be honest with you I just want to find out whether the Learners have already received the psychosocial support so that they could be able to deal with this matter and move forward with their with their studies indeed uh we we we a visit from the local Subs uh I think it was over Wednesday if not if I'm not mistaken they came with the social services and uh uh we they spoke to our lers and uh after speaking with them I think some they are copying very well though we still have those that were closed very close to the disas Joseph Maya uh we still struggling with them but uh hopefully we will also continue to get them uh help Social Services well thank you so much for talking to us that is the SGP cherson Isaac mahai I'm now joined here CH by the um St manager Dr Johannes M thank you so much for joining us here on Sac news we understand that this matter is a very sensitive issue uh just take us through what is the latest in terms of the uh investigation into what led to the um deceased you know taking his life thank you very much U at this point in time H what I can say maybe let me start by saying that in the Department of Education uh we have communication services so I'm here as the second manager of and secondary it's falling under my management so my role uh today is to come here and pay tribute to the family as I was requested by my immediate senior the district director Mr KD mman but what I can say is that in the department there are sections that are dealing with issues of this nature like with this one what I know is that investigations are under process and those people are the ones who are now having the latest information since you know that this matter for now is still sub judicate you know we understand that the pain of you know being bullied by a teacher so excruciating and what can we learn and what can other teachers across the province learn from this incident no as I alluded to earlier on is that we he cannot draw any conclusions for now and uh the person who's responsible to respond uh to all these uh questions as you are raising now is not here I was just given the matching ERS that I must come here and deliver the message to the family to comfort the family and nothing more and nothing less so but you are promising the family that the the investigations are currently under way because earlier on we spoke to them and they were saying that they are not receiving any update h no one has been suspended are you are you are you you know confirming to them that indeed uh something is being done no I cannot make any confirmation at this point because that is not my line of March that people who are suitable to can respond to that question and thank you well thank you so much that is Dr Muna the second manager here uh in um around M where this incident actually took place but I can tell you that as we speak now we can see that uh people are now moving from this tent where the funeral service was taking place and they moving to the graveyard the nearest graveyard in this Village but I can tell you CH that um Dr Muna is saying that the investigation yes is is currently underway but he cannot delve much into that issue precisely because he was only sent here by the department to pay tribute to the family but that is currently what is happening now and we also spoke to some of the Learners around here who who mentioned that you know indeed they were subjected to uh this you know um um The Bullying incidents in that particular school and that uh you know the the report of this learner who actually committed suicide was actually pared to everyone in that particular school which actually you know um is alleged to have had a hand in in in him you know committing that suicide but for now let's get back to you in studio CH poo thank you very much indeed um very tragic story that you're covering for us uh today and uh of course that Community um at a l for words over what has happened

9UxG55q3NVY,Breast Cancer Awareness | Men in Heels Walkathon - 'The disease is a collective responsibility',2024-10-12T07:44:24Z,310,moving on to this now the man in Hills wathon is an impactful event aimed at raising awareness about breast cancer emphasizing that the disease is not exclusive to women this unique initiative invites men to Da high hills and take to the streets showcasing solidarity in the fight against breast cancer and challenging traditional gender Norms participants of the walkeron come together to promote the message that breast cancer can affect anyone regardless of gender while it is predominantly known as a women's health issue men can also develop breast cancer alate at a lower rate cancer survivor David Lucas joins us now for more and by the way he did insist that he's got three three kids and three grandchildren you may be wearing a skirt and high heels but hey well good morning and welcome thank you so much and I'm glad that you giv us giving us the opportunity to talk about a very serious matter but before I go there I really want to pay condolences to what has happened sigi indeed indeed uh it's actually a there's a sort of a personal touch there my wife's father was originally fromi then moved to mat and that's where she was born so there's a personal thing but I think of those people that just died on the roads in K ATN we are waiting for news that's coming forth from the Eastern Cape again with a car accident seven people died seven people died and suu with the kids that are being buried there you know life is full of Gloom so great to be out to trying to make a bit of a fun event with regards to that to make an impact and I wish it was my initiative that I thought of it but lat M from uh the black cherry started with this idea reason why in particularly she looked at it yeah they are we've always or men are always under impression that is something that only women will get is breast cancer and women are aware of it I look at some of of of the the the visuals that we see every day that women are taught how to touch their breast make sure that there's no lumps yeah men can also get breast cancer and you know an interesting fact that loratu came up with and through the research was that there's a correlation between breast cancer in men and prostate cancer both of them testerone levels high testerone levels so this is a reality one in 700 men can get breast cancer it's actually a scarying thought and having said that Lucas uh what's the most effective screening method to ensure that uh you know we early detect breast cancer in men in particular right simple enough again firstly the same situation with wi feel and and that goes for everything it's not only breast cancer it's not only prostate cancer it's only testical cancer if you feel a lump if you feel uneasy if you feel their body is not responding the way that it does it is your duty to do that it's your duty to go and check it out right doctors are professionals men are scared to go to doctors yeah because we are actually scared of what might may happen and just now I was asked this very same question what about my sexual libido just about 10 minutes what about my sexual again a scary thought for men guys if it is caught early you have the opportunity that your sexual won't won't suffer from it you will still be able to have a fulfilling sex life if it is qu too late you're in a different stage you're in a different situation now we've got to and and and I always say to people that cancer is the reality of life we all going to die but we are fearful it is topic that we don't want to discuss and let us be frank we know that it's there but we even want to make it off off as if people died of something else instead of cancer it's not a sin it is not a a situation of you died because you did something wrong nothing like that it's a human sickness it's a illness that can affect anybody yeah I was diagnosed in 2011 I'm still here and having said that can you share that experience of being diagnosed and early testing um how that might have affected their experience right I was diagnosed with prostate cancer Yeah by chance I need to say that I went to my doct what do you mean by chance I went to my doctor and I said to him you know what I think I've got I'm developing arthritis said to me rubbish that's 2011 2013 in fact yeah said to me rubbish man I said to him you let's take Bloods because it's a friend of mine we had this a bit bit for back and forth and eventually he did that and guess what happened he came back to me and said to me you've got Gout I had absolutely no symptoms now we always believe that in prostate cancer you go find it difficult to urinate you find it waking up at night urinating that you have pain I had absolutely no no symptoms that would relate to that M Bloods been taken guys again that is myth number two guys fear if I go to the doctor he's going to do a digital examination which means your finger right right and it's not necessary because today the way the times that we are living in we can actually just have the blood test simple blood test boom instead of the traditional method instead of the traditional listen if there's something that worries you if the doctor is worried then but you know what digital examination as opposed to do you dying I'd rather have the digital examination than than dying okay I mean like they say there's the saying I always say to people getting old is not for sissies but boy oh boy it beats dying any day sure tell me about it let's talk about this walkeron and I see you wearing a skirt and and high heels well what like what does a skirt and high heels have to do with uh breast cancer awareness especially among men great this is a fun event yeah it's fun to see men walking around men are always bombarded at work you bombarded with statistics where you where you go you B barded with chats about when I say chats it is it is all academic Styles you go to a doctor he's going to talk to you academically no we are trying to change this we want men to be aware of what we're doing okay we want men to be aware that there

kHeX7F8dZe0,"Exhibition | ""Traces in the Still Air"" - Delves into the profound themes of memory and grief",2024-10-12T07:31:12Z,274,taong is a distinguished fine artist whose solo exhibition traces in the still air delves into the profound themes of memories and grief with an evocative title the exhibition suggests a contemplative exploration of emotions that linger just beyond the grasp of tangible understanding in this body of work employs a variety of artistic techniques and mediums to portray the ways in which grief and memory shape our lives through these Concepts well even though they might remain invisible to the naked his artwork encapsulates the essence of these emotional states allowing audiences to intuitively connect with them L joins us now in studio for more very good morning to L thanks for joining us welcome thank you and I suppose uh it's no coincidence that uh you know the theme is grief and sorrow that South Africa you know is experiencing a cloud of grief this morning uh with the various Debs throughout the country but first of all what inspired the theme of memories and grief for traces in the still uh thank you for having me again uh Tris in the still was inspired by my childhood memories I was born in katong and as a as a kid we used to to go to a swinging park with friends and we had to cross the the railway and my mother was against that uh for safety reasons but we didn't care about that as kids so the the idea emerged from the Thrills that I missed as a kids for uh going to The Swinging Park so that's how I came about um the idea to explore both uh memory and grief as as an idea but why grief though uh just recently lost my grandmother who played like a very important role in my life so uh it's it's more of me trying to uh make peace with it right right and pay tribut to her as well yes yes I'm so sorry to hear that man and and having said that you just told us you know that you lost your dearly loved relative so can you describe how you translated the invisible Notions of grief uh into visual art uh I used uh swings as you know they go both back back and forth you know and they leave those those invisible marks in in in in the air so that's how I I translated the the the notion of invisible marks I believe that memories and gries are just like invisible marks in our lives going back and forth right right that is so profound and how do you you hope viewers will sort of engage with the concept of grief that you've encapsulated through this artwork uh I made an installation for for that reasons because I I think uh the experience need to be F rather than being being perceived and being walked around I I think viewers by engaging with the work itself they they'll have their own moments to to reflect and appreciate the show and how will you ensure that they actually feel the emotion uh with this show I have two different materials uh symbolizing different elements I have tires of which we know tires symbolizes uh a movement and I have broken classes of bots yeah that reflects the the notion of pain as well so the Jer position between the two materials and trying to to to draw the the contrast between the two material the one is playful which is the swing and the class is like harsh and and dangerous so yes now in terms of the selection of the medium for your art was it intentional or you just allow yourself to uh you know to or rather you immerse yourself to whatever is happening around you to your own personal experiences the the material was intentional um there are 33 swings that are suspended in the roof and they all like uh resemble each swing is like a year for me I'm 33 years old now and they are both uh they are suspended with different levels so each of the Swing has its own highs and lows you know so they yeah it's not they are not linear as I believe memories and uh grief is not something that is linear they are not constant they absolutely absolutely and we've got different memories I mean we've got different experiences as well in different wow and in what ways do you think art can help people process their own you know process their own experiences process their own emotions uh just trying to find space like for them to be in a good space uh I think they should go and engage with the art itself because as artist I don't believe we have that power to to tell people what to feel or how to feel around the artwork itself you know as we we don't have the same memories we don't we don't suffer from the same trauma so uh it do mean different things to us some will like it some won't and but what's what is important is for us to engage at the end of the day absolutely and which of the pieces do you think resonate the most with the theme it's it's an installation it's just one piece oh it's just one single piece yes it's a single piece it's and how do you see your work evolving in terms of telling a story because your piece uh tells a story on its own and what I like about it is that um it can be viewed in an abstract sense each and everyone who views your piece U could strike a personal resonance to it they could see themselves through this piece see their own personal experiences through this piece uh amazing enough uh at the day of the opening I met people who actually experienced the the pce differently and most of them they managed to to go to their childhood memories so uh that was like more of an achievement to me and uh I like it yeah I don't have much to say about it right right no it's okay it's absolutely okay man I mean this is so profound and how long did it take you to bring this together uh I would say two months for conceptualizing collecting the materials uh working on the materials and and the installation and just looking back at your work uh do you think and feel that it sort of aligns with your initial vision for this project yes it does okay yes it does and looking back do you think that there certain elements that uh you should have added or you shouldn't have added no it's complete it is complete it is complete so what is it that you want those will be viewing this piece to walk away from because I would imagine they would walk away a different person I think they should walk towards towards something rather than working away yeah I think they should walk to towards knowing who they are understanding who they are understanding their m memories cuz these memories they they shape us they shape who we are as people you know how how how we make decision we are being influenced by by this memory so I think we should work they should work towards self-discovery uhuh yeah so just moving forward are you also going to work towards creating more pieces that will make people self-discover themselves I hope so but they continue creating right right yeah yeah all right L great chatting to you man thank you so much for joining us thank you very much awesome well fine artist lat mut talking to us about his solo exhibition traces in the still air transcending the visible inviting viewers into a space where the intangible aspects of Human Experience memories and feelings of loss are thoughtfully examined
